an ultralong cdrh2 in hcv neutralizing antibody demonstrates structural plasticity of antibodies against e2 glycoprotein andrew flyak i stormy ruiz e jordan salas semi rho justin bailey r pamela bjorkman j pivi ojala m wenhui li   hcv infections are on the rise in the united states reflecting increasing rates of opioid addiction zibbell et al 2018 an hcv vaccine is urgently needed to control the epidemic but vaccine development is challenging due to the enormous genetic diversity of the hcv envelope proteins yusim et al 2010 the hcv genome encodes two structural proteins e1 and e2 that associate to form a noncovalent heterodimer e1e2 freedman et al 2016 potent bnabs isolated from hcv-infected individuals predominantly target conserved epitopes in the front layer of the e2 glycoprotein the majority of bnabs that bind to the front layer are derived from vh1-69 genes tzarum et al 2019 which are also associated with bnabs that target conserved epitopes on influenza virus and hiv-1 envelope glycoproteins chen et al 2019 we recently described crystal structures of two vh1-69 bnabs hepc3 and hepc74 isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared hcv infection flyak et al 2018 both bnabs utilized a disulfide motif in their cdrh3 regions to recognize a conserved epitope in the front layer of e2 while the hepc3 and hepc74 cdrh3 loops adopted a straight -hairpin conformation the vh1-69-encoded ar3a and ar3c bnabs that were isolated from an individual with a chronic hcv infection included bent cdrh3 loops that contained an analogous disulfide motif kong et al 2013 since the two bnabs with straight cdrh3s were isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared hcv infection and the two bnabs with bent cdrh3s were isolated from a single chronically-infected individual we wondered if some individuals are naturally predisposed to make antibodies with straight or bent cdrh3s andor whether the straight cdrh3 conformation was related to the ability to clear hcv infection among bnabs isolated from a chronically-infected individual law et al 2008 we found ar3x a vh1-69-encoded antibody that included a cdrh3 with a disulfide motif and an unusually long 14-amino acid-long insertion in cdrh2 figure 1a ar3x provided an opportunity to explore the structural plasticity of vh1-69-derived anti-hcv bnabs with a disulfide-containing cdrh3 and to determine the impact of a long cdrh2 insertion on the recognition of the conserved epitope in e2 front layer the most likely scenario resulting in the insertion into the cdrh2 of ar3x involves a duplication event as the cdrh2 insertion has 69 identity with the n-terminal sequence preceding the cdrh2 figure 1b similar to other front layer-specific bnabs with the cdrh3 disulfide motif figure 1e the cysteines in the ar3x cdrh3 region are encoded by the human d gene segment 15 ighd2-15 figure 1c the c-terminal portion of the ar3x cdrh3 is likely encoded by human j-gene segment 302 j302 not including the 14-amino acid insertion in cdrh2 ar3x shares 91 nucleotide identity with the vh1-69 gene segment and includes 17 somatic mutations figure 1d to investigate the importance of the cdrh2 insertion and the effects of somatic mutations on ar3x binding and neutralization we generated a panel of ar3x variants ar3x ins ar3x without the cdrh2 insertion ar3xrua germline precursor of ar3x which lacks the cdrh2 insertion and somatic mutations and ar3xrua  ins germline precursor of ar3x with the cdrh2 insertion figure 1d we evaluated the binding of ar3x and ar3x variants to a panel of e2 ectodomain e2ecto proteins representing the e2 envelopes from 19 hcv genotype 1 strains we also tested the binding of ar3x and ar3x variants to e2ecto proteins from genotypes 2 3 4 5 and 6 strains ar3x recognized all 19 e2 envelopes from genotype 1 including the 1a116 strain which was not recognized by other front layer-specific bnabs that include the cdrh3 disulfide motif figure 2a figure 2figure supplement 1 flyak et al 2018 ar3x also recognized e2 envelopes from genotypes 2 3 4 5 and 6 figure 2a in contrast to mature ar3x the ar3x ins protein that lacks the cdrh2 insertion bound only 4 of the 25 variants indicating that the cdrh2 insertion mediates the breath of binding while ar3xrua failed to bind any e2ecto proteins ar3xrua  ins recognized 1 of the 25 variants further highlighting the importance of the cdrh2 insertion in initial recognition of the e2 antigen by nave b cells the fact that ar3xrua  ins only bound to one hcv strain whereas mature ar3x recognized all strains indicated that somatic mutations in addition to the cdrh2 insertion are required for breath of binding and optimal e2 recognition consistent with our previous studies in which the strain 1a157 e2ecto envelope was recognized by hepc3 hepc74 ar3c and their germline precursors flyak et al 2018 ar3x and two ar3x variants ar3x ins ar3xrua  ins also bound to 1a157 suggesting that immunogens based on the genotype 1 1a157 ectodomain sequence could be used to stimulate the development of potent front layer-specific bnabs figure 2a figure 2figure supplement 1 to evaluate the neutralization breadth of ar3x variants we evaluated antibodies in an in vitro neutralization assay using a panel of 19 genotype 1 hcv pseudoparticles hcvpp that represents 94 of the amino acid polymorphisms present at 5 frequency in a reference panel of 643 genotype 1 hcv isolates from genbank munshaw et al 2012 only mature ar3x exhibited neutralization activity neutralizing 17 of 19 hcv strains figure 2b figure 2figure supplement 2 the neutralization breadth of ar3x 89 was slightly lower than the breath of ar3c bnab 100 flyak et al 2018 which was isolated from the same hcv-infected individual law et al 2008 ar3x variants failed to neutralize hcv isolates suggesting that both the cdrh2 insertion and somatic mutations are required for the broad neutralization activity of ar3x we and others described two classes of vh1-69 bnabs with a cdrh3 disulfide motif bnabs with a straight cdrh3 hepc3 and hepc74 and bnabs with a kinked cdrh3 ar3a and ar3c flyak et al 2018 kong et al 2013 tzarum et al 2019 figure 3 to determine to which class ar3x belongs we determined the crystal structure of ar3x in complex with e2ecto from the 1b09 hcv strain figure 4 figure 4figure supplement 1 the 22  ar3x-e2ecto structure demonstrated that similar to previously-characterized hcv bnabs that recognize the neutralizing face of e2 flyak et al 2018 kong et al 2013 tzarum et al 2019 ar3x binds to the conserved epitope in the e2 front layer figure 4a the ar3x cdrh3 loop contains two cysteines that form a disulfide bond as seen in multiple other e2 front layer-binding bnabs and the ar3x cdrh3 adopts the straight conformation we previously described in the hepc3 and hepc74 bnabs that were isolated from an individual who cleared hcv infection flyak et al 2018 figure 3 by contrast the cdrh3s of ar3a and ar3c which were isolated from the same hcv-infected individual as ar3x law et al 2008 are bent kong et al 2013 tzarum et al 2019 the tip of the ar3x cdrh3 loop interacts with the same conserved residues in the front layer of e2 as the cdrh3 tips in the other hcv bnabs figure 4e figure 4figure supplement 2 overall ar3x has a similar binding footprint to the footprints of hepc3 hepc74 ar3c and ar3a sharing multiple contact residues in the front layer and cd81 receptor-binding loop figure 4figure supplement 2 as also found for these other front layer-specific bnabs ar3xs contacts with e2ecto almost exclusively involved vh domain residues burying 1250 2 98 of the total fab buried surface area bsa figure 4b with the cdrh3 accounting for 445 556 2 of the total bsa on the vh domain figure 4b figure 4figure supplement 2 however in contrast to other front layer-specific bnabs in which the cdrh3 plays a dominant role in the interactions with e2 envelope flyak et al 2018 kong et al 2013 tzarum et al 2019 the main contributor to the ar3x-e2ecto binding interface was cdrh2 which accounted for 482 602 2 of the total bsa of the vh domain with the majority of the binding footprint provided by the cdrh2 insertion 454 or 567 2 of total bsa of the vh domain figure 4c we next investigated the frequency of antibodies with 14-residue cdrh2 insertions while the size of an insertion or deletion in human antibody genes ranges from 3 to 33 nucleotides kanyavuz et al 2019 ar3x has a unusually long 42-nucleotide insertion which results in a 31-residue cdrh2 kabat definition kabat and national institutes of health us office of the director 1991 according to the abysis database swindells et al 2017 a typical human cdrh2 is 17 residues relative frequency 67 figure 4d and cdrh2s longer than 20 residues are rare relative frequency 1 to our knowledge ar3x with its 31-residue cdrh2 represents the longest cdrh2 among antibody structures available in the protein data bank pdb although the cdh3s of ar3x ar3a ar3c hepc3 and hepc74 cdrh3s make similar binding footprints on the e2 surface figure 5 the difference in fab approach angles and the presence of the long insertion in the ar3x cdrh2 result in different footprints on e2 for the vh1-69encoded cdrh2 loops of the bnabs ar3x cdrh2 contacts the c-terminus of the e2 1-helix the portion of the e2 front layer between the -helix variable region 2 residues 446448 and the back layer of e2 residues 444 445 figure 4f and figure 4figure supplement 2 in contrast the ar3a and ar3c cdrh2 contacts are reduced to hydrophobic residues in 1-helix kong et al 2013 whereas the hepc3 and hepc74 cdrh2s contact the e2 1-helix and the portion of the e2 front layer between the 1-helix and variable region 2 residues 446448 flyak et al 2018 a feature of vh1-69-derived antibodies is the presence of two hydrophobic residues at the tip of the cdrh2 loop that facilitate interactions with hydrophobic epitopes the cdrh2s of ar3a and ar3c contain an ileval-pro-metleu-phe motif in which hydrophobic residues interact with the e2 front layer and cd81 binding loop chen et al 2019 the cdrh2s of hepc3 and hepc74 are less hydrophobic and contain a thrser-pro-ile-pheser motif chen et al 2019 in addition to hydrophobic interactions with the e2 front layer the hepc3 cdrh2 also makes a single hydrogen bond with e2 flyak et al 2018 by contrast ar3x is a not a typical vh1-69 antibody in which hydrophobic residues in cdrh2 mediate the binding to hydrophobic residues in e2 chen et al 2019 instead the ar3x cdrh2 forms eight hydrogen bonds with the e2 glycoprotein four of which are mediated by ar3x residue arg52g ar3x-e2ecto pro52c-his445 pro52e-thr444 arg52g-ala440 arg52g-phe442 arg52g-tyr443 arg52g-pro612 asn52n-tyr443 trp52i-tyr613 figure 4f figure 4figure supplement 2 notably these differences in binding interactions have functional implications as these mabs differ in potency of neutralization of individual hcv strains in the hcvpp panel for example the ar3x neutralization ic50 for strain 1b21 is 17 fold lower than the ic50 of hepc3 12 vs 205 gml in contrast the ar3x neutralization ic50 for strain 1a142 is 9 fold higher than the ic50 of hepc3 162 vs 19 gml figure 2 flyak et al 2018 a signature feature of the ar3aar3c and hepc3hepc74 types of hcv bnabs is the long cdrh3 that forms multiple main chainmain chain hydrogen bonds with e2 front layer residues flyak et al 2018 tzarum et al 2019 similar to other front layer-specific bnabs with a cdrh3 disulfide motif the first cysteine residue of the ar3x cdrh3 cys100a hydrogen bonds with e2 residue cys429 figure 4g figure 4figure supplement 2 flyak et al 2018 kong et al 2013 tzarum et al 2019 three additional hydrogen bonds ar3x-e2ecto arg99-asp431 arg99-asn430 asn96-asp431 as well as a salt bridge between cdrh3 arg100b and a cd81 binding loop residue glu531 further stabilize the interaction of ar3x with e2 the ar3x-e2ecto crystal structure also shows contacts between the ar3x cdrh3 and n-glycans attached to e2 residues asn423 and asn430 figure 4g we and others previously described hcv bnabs that utilize the vh1-69 gene segment and a germline-encoded disulfide motif in cdrh3 to recognize the conserved epitope in e2 front layer flyak et al 2018 keck et al 2019 kong et al 2013 tzarum et al 2019 here we structurally characterized a front layer-specific hcv bnab that is encoded by the vh1-69 gene that includes an ultralong insertion in cdrh2 as well as the disulfide motif in cdrh3 we found that ar3x isolated from the same chronically-infected patient as ar3a or ar3c law et al 2008 surprisingly exhibits the straight cdrh3 conformation found in the hepc3 or hepc74 bnabs isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared hcv infection figure 3 this indicates that a single individual can produce potent hcv-specific bnabs using the common vh1-69 and d2-15 genes that bind to the conserved region of e2 in at least three different configurations straight cdrh3 with cdrh2 insertion straight cdrh3 without cdrh2 insertion or bent cdrh3 without cdrh2 insertion highlighting the intrinsic plasticity of the vh1-69encoded cdrh1 and cdrh2 loops that accommodate different antibody approach angles figure 5 its likely that the cdrh3s of these bnabs dictate the preferential mode of engagement of bnab germline precursors with the conserved epitope in the e2 front layer overall these data demonstrate that b cells using vh1-69 and d2-15 genes can follow multiple pathways of affinity maturation to achieve broad neutralizing activity in the four bnabs that were previously characterized structurally flyak et al 2018 kong et al 2013 tzarum et al 2019 the first cysteine residue of the cdrh3 hydrogen bonds with e2 residue cys429 figure 4g figure 4figure supplement 2 we hypothesize that after the initial recognition of the front layer by cdrh3 the vh1-69-encoded cdrh1 and cdrh2 further stabilize the interaction while subsequent somatic mutations increase the bnab affinity and breadth other antibodies that utilize a cdrh3 stabilized by a disulfide bond have been also described in the literature sui et al 2009 thomson et al 2008 ying et al 2015 for example m336 a potent human antibody that neutralizes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ying et al 2014 is encoded by the vh1-69 gene segment and includes a germline-encoded disulfide bond in its cdrh3 ying et al 2015 nucleotide insertions and deletions play an important role in diversification of the antibody repertoire de wildt et al 1999 reason and zhou 2006 wilson et al 1998 insertions are produced by sequence duplications while the average size of insertion varies from 3 to 33 nucleotides the majority of antibodies contain short insertions kanyavuz et al 2019 wilson et al 1998 ar3x with its 42-nucleotide insertion in cdrh2 represents an interesting case of an antibody that utilizes an ultralong cdrh2 to bind its epitope figure 4 the insertion was required for recognition of e2 glycoproteins across multiple hcv strains as evidenced by the poor binding activity of ar3x variants lacking the cdrh2 insertion figure 2 while several neutralizing antibodies with insertions have been described kepler et al 2014 krause et al 2011 ar3x is unique for its exceptionally long cdrh2 insertion which makes extensive contacts with e2 but does not change the preconfigured mode of ar3x interaction with e2 based on its straight cdrh3 containing a disulfide motif thus the conserved epitope in the hcv e2 front layer which is recognized by multiple human bnabs containing a disulfide motif in their cdrh3s figure 5 remains a promising target for lineage-based immunogen design hek293-6e cells were obtained from national

coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which was provisionally named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses1 is a newly identified member of human coronavirus species that has emerged recently and caused a highly infectious disease covid-19 has spread aggressively across the globe since it was first reported in december 20192 and declared as a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 up to april 7 2020 133 million and 83071 cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide and in china respectively presently management of allergic rhinitis ar is a growing concern throughout the world as over 500 million people including 25 million in china have ar and in the event of a global infectious pandemic access to allergy services is likely to be drastically limited or adjusted the concern arises particularly due to an overlap of certain upper respiratory symptoms due to ar influenza as well as viral infection of the upper respiratory tract during the early stages in this sense rhinologists and allergists are responsible for timely diagnosis and treatment of suspected or diagnosed ar patients in order to reduce the patients anxiety of suffering from covid-19 infection and unnecessary medical burden moreover patients receiving allergen immunotherapy ait currently the only curative intervention for ar particularly subcutaneous immunotherapy scit need to attend their local allergy centres to complete their treatments successfully in this regard 13800 patients in china are currently receiving scit and among these patients 87 have reached their maintenance period but not completed their treatment if such patients were unable to continue the ongoing therapy because of the infectious pandemic this would undoubtedly result in great disease-related health and financial loss for the patients as well as financial loss for the local healthcare system thus implementing effective strategies for maximized effective management of ar patients coupled with prevention of the covid-19 cross-infection among health care workers hcws as well as patients within allergy centres during the present covid-19 pandemic is of vital importance for the medical community beijing which is outside the center of the epidemic in china has a total of 588 confirmed covid-19 cases to date three designated hospitals have been opened for the treatment of patients with covid-19 in beijing whereas tasks of the other non-designated comprehensive medical centers such as beijing tongren hospital for example mainly involve screening for covid-19 cases and sustaining emergency and necessary outpatient medical services a fever clinic which was originated from the battle against sars in 2003 in china is specifically set up in our hospital to identify the cause of the fever and distinguish the actual covid-19 cases from patients with fever andor respiratory symptoms similar to those found in covid-19 cases during the covid-19 epidemic the number of outpatient visits to allergy clinic of beijing tongren hospital decreased by 90 compared with the same period in the previous year however this has now gradually recovered to 50 ie 100 patients per day all 423 local ar outpatients are receiving immunotherapy continuously and account for 75 of the total patients undergoing scit the management of ar includes allergen avoidance pharmacotherapy ait and patient education3 a panel of allergyimmunology specialists from the us and canada has recently published an expert panel consensus document which provides a prioritization rational to help guide decision-making for allergistimmunologist when they need to limit services to their patients during the covid-19 pandemic4 based on the experience of allergy clinic of beijing tongren hospital one of the largest and best-known allergy clinics in china we have developed an algorithm specifically for management of ar figure during the covid-19 pandemic in china this involves a strict screening protocol to ensure that the patients who are coming to the allergy clinic are not infected by covid-19 as initially indicated by a body temperature lower than 373c5 and a negative epidemiological history which indicates that the patients had remained in beijing for over 14 days prior to the hospital visit thus for screening purpose the entrance to the hospital has been arranged with infrared human body temperature screening door that a patients temperature is measured and a history of their movement over the last 14 days are recorded before the patient can enter the hospital the epidemiological history is an important part of screening and a record of the patients movement within 2 weeks can be obtained by scanning a smartphone at the entrance of the hospital only patients with both a normal temperature and a negative epidemiological history are allowed to proceed to the outpatient departments and a second body temperature measurement with contactless forehead temperature grab will be performed before entering each targeted department whereas patients with a body temperature higher than 373c are guided to the fever clinic to have additional screening examinations including routine blood tests and chest computed tomography scanning throat swabs are also taken for sars-cov-2 rna testing if necessary to separate patients with fever andor respiratory symptoms including cough runny nose sore throat along with nasal congestion and sneezing similar to those found in covid-19 when a patients viral nucleic acid test result is found to be positive the patient is transferred to one of the covid-19 designated hospitals for further treatment there is presently inconclusive evidence on the safe use of corticosteroids in asthmatic patients affected by covid-19 however in the case of ar patients infected with covid-19 the aria-mask study group and the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology have recently developed an expert consensus statement which recommends that use of intranasal corticosteroids ins in ar should be continued at the recommended dose as stopping the ins would increase sneezing and lead to more spreading of the virus6 in regard to the influence of continuous use of ins in ar patients infected with covid-19 on the disease of covid-19 as well as immune defenses and health outcomes of affected patients there is a paucity of real-world experience and thus the recommendation for ins should be adjusted accordingly based on the new data confirmed in view of the fact that droplets caused by respiratory symptoms such as sneezing and coughing and tears caused by conjunctivitis7 may be an important source of viral transmission the protection of hcws is particularly important when close inspection or contact with allergic patients is necessary for example when administering ait injections besides taking the standardized basic precautions including wearing work clothes disposable surgical masks and waterproof medical caps all hcws in allergy clinics take extra precautions by wearing anti-fog protective goggles and protective face shields during an outpatient visit the patient is admitted to a single consulting room with good ventilation and at most one doctor and one nurse in attendance in the room at the same time patients are required to observe social distancing regulations with other patients when waiting for their consultation with the doctor or when under observation following the immunotherapy injection during this consultation all specialized examinations such as anterior rhinoscopy endoscopy rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry pulmonary function and serum allergen tests are suspended apart from the outpatient visit the patient can obtain knowledge of prevention and control of ar via the general public media platform currently 564 patients are receiving scit in our clinic before covid-19 epidemic of whom 75 of these patients are long-term residents in beijing and undergoing continuous scit following the screening process during the covid-19 epidemic the remaining 25 of the patients who live outside beijing have each been contacted by telephone and been advised that in order to reduce the risk of infection in the process of transportation their treatment should be suspended until the end of the epidemic fortunately to date all the local patients have successfully been treated by ait with no case of infection with covid-19 being recorded among these patients based on this experience it is clear that there needs to be a high level of cooperation between doctors nurses technicians and the patients for a successful outcome at present as beijing enters the peak of the spring pollen season beijing tongren hospital is cooperating with the china meteorological administration httpwwwweathercomcnforecasthfindexshtmlid101010100fromsinglemessageisappinstalled0 and beijing meteorological bureau httpbjweatheriyuebocomweatherphpachart2 to establish a pollen monitoring network for to predict pollen counts providing useful information towards the patients with pollen allergy this service is being popularized via the internet and mobile app technology wechat and also provides medical services such as online consultations and delivery of medications to patients moreover the specialists will also increase tv media publicity httpsitembtimecomf2ig2sk409q9m5pasnv85tns89e and provide more online lectures on diseases using zoom or tencent real time conferencing software during the outbreak the doctors will also recommend to the patients the over-the-counter drugs which can be bought from their local pharmacies to control their allergic symptoms we suggest that the experience and lessons learned from allergy clinics in various countries during the current covid-19 pandemic need to be summarized and shared in time in the hope that this will help in the provision of better services and management of patients suffering from allergic diseases during this pandemic  molecular analysis of several in-house rrt-pcr protocols for sars-cov-2 detection in the context of genetic variability of the virus in colombia diego

coronavirus ratg13 zhou et al 2020 912 with the malay pangolin coronavirus isolate pangolin-cov zhang et al 2020 and even 975 with rmyn02 derived from bat when the orf1ab gene is exclusively analyzed wang et al 2020 its recent origin is enigmatic since there is a high similarity between the amino acid sequence in the receptor-binding domain rbd domain of subunit 1 s1 of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 and that of pangolin-cov but the latter lacks the polybasic furin processing site exclusive to sars-cov-2 andersen et al 2020 accumulated evidence suggests a zoonotic origin of the virus as a result of recombination with a yet unidentified coronavirus or convergent evolution driven by natural selection to optimize interaction with the human ace2 cell receptor wang et al 2020 who 2020b after the publication of the complete sars-cov-2 genome in genomic data repositories such as ncbi mn9089473 and the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid in mid-january 2020 health agencies and researchers from different countries quickly developed sars-cov-2 screening tests based on real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr that amplify different sars-cov-2 gene regions hundreds of commercial

these protocols are not known in the context of more than 31000 sequences reported on may 24 2020 worldwide including latin america which provide a more complete perspective of the accumulated genetic variability and sequence particularities of viruses circulating in specific regions that could affect the efficiency and sensitivity of the rrt-pcr protocols currently shared by who the mutation rate of sars-cov-2 as a virus with an rna genome is higher than that of viruses with a dna genome tang et al 2020 with an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 224  103 substitutionssiteyear li et al 2020

technologies following the articnetwork ncov-2019 sequencing protocol quick 2020 in both strategies sars-cov-2 specific oligonucleotides were used for the generation of amplicons by means of a q5 high fidelity dna polymerase new england biolabs inc uk in order to avoid the introduction of artificial mutations the genomes were assembled by mapping to the reference genome nc0455122 using the bwa li et al 2020 and bbmap brian-jgi 2020 software to generate a consensus genome by the two assembly tools the colombian genomes and oligonucleotides from of the in-house protocols were aligned with the muscle tool edgar 2004 using the mega x software kumar et al 2018 substitutions matrices of the colombian genomes respect to the reference genome nc045512 at the nucleotide and amino acid levels were generated for the 13 rrt-pcr protocols published at the who website who 2020c which several countries have established as their preferred diagnostic protocol for sars-cov-2 thermodynamic features priming tm and g at the variable sites mispriming and g hairpin g and primer dimer g and the codon position at the 3 end for oligonucleotides with conflicting sites and optimized oligonucleotides were evaluated into the primerselect module of the lasergene v81 suite dnastar inc madison wi usa a total of 39 primer and probe sequences from the main in-house rrt-pcr protocols for sars-cov-2 detection published at who website were aligned to the reference sequence derived from the first confirmed case at wuhan hubei province china and named wuhan-1 strain genbank accession number nc0455122 the protocols targeted 13 different genome regions inside the orf1ab nsp9 nsp10 nsp11 rdrp exon e envelope and n nucleocapsid genes with 61 5 813 of the assays targeting the n gene fig 1
 the alignment of the 39 oligonucleotides to the reference and colombian sars-cov-2 sequences 5 showed mismatches with at least one colombian sequence table 1
 the conflicting sites in the primerprobe sequences were due to 1 a mismatch between the oligonucleotide and the reference and colombian sequences or 2 a mismatch between the oligonucleotide and one or more colombian sequences
 the hong kong2020 hku-np probe chu et al 2020 fig 2 was extremely different to all the reference and colombian sars-cov-2 by four nucleotide sites this probe also presents the formation of a highly stable hairpin and self-dimer structures table s1 the corman-berlin 2020 rdrp sarsr-f2 corman et al 2020 fig 3 region was variable in one colombian sars-cov-2 sequence from the department of valle del cauca id 79943 involving a critical site at the 3 pentamer this site is supposed to prevent the correct hybridization of the 3 end of the primer leading to inefficient or unsuccessful extension by the dna polymerase the rdrp sarsr-r1 primer corman et al 2020 showed a degenerate site which does not comprise the nucleotide found in the reference and colombian sars-cov-2 sequences however this mismatch was located at an internal site of the primer only partially affecting the thermodynamic profile of the primer-target hybridization the zhu 2020 cdc-china set i probeorf1ab zhu et al 2020 fig 4 was found to be almost completely complementary with the colombian sars-cov-2 sequences except for a viral sequence obtained from a human case in the department of antioquia id 79253 bearing a single substitution at the seventh probe position without considerable effect on the thermodynamic features for probe-target hybridization table s1 the zhu 2020 cdc-china set ii fw n primer fig 5 hybridization was found to be critically affected by the accumulated genetic diversity of the colombian sars-cov-2 strains at the 5 end of the primer a triple-nucleotide substitution gggaac in three sequences from bogot and valle del cauca affected the tm and g at the 3 region two sequences from quindo displayed a substitution affecting the 3 pentamer stability the primers and probes sets

accumulated genetic variability in available sequences of colombian strains of sars-cov-2 codon positions in coding regions are differentially susceptible to nucleotide substitution being the third codon position associated with a higher substitution rate on the other hand the perfect matching of the last nucleotide at the 3 end of every forward and reverse primer is critical for dna polymerase-based extension during pcr amplification staheli et al 2009 therefore the rational design of primer to be used with rapidly evolving rna viruses should have the requisite of avoiding third and sometimes first codon positions codon position of the last nucleotide at the 3 end of every analyzed primer was identified according to the corresponding open-reading frame the 3 end of 11 primers corresponded to the first codon position another 11 primers had 3 ends located at the second codon position and the 3 end of 4 primers aligned with the third codon position table 1 one of the primers nao 2020japanniid 2019-ncov n f2 had the 3 end aligned with the first codon position of the codon cua which encodes for alanine this codon allows a substitution at the first codon position c to u to be synonymous and therefore may escape to the selection pressure at the protein level the 3 end of the primers cdc 2020usa 2019-ncov n1-f cdc 2020usa 2019-ncov n3-f cdc 2020usa 2019-ncov n3-r and hong

n3 at the n gene making this protocol very susceptible to false negative results as the viral genetic variability increases next generation sequencing ngs technologies are a valuable tool in determining the whole genome of microorganisms impacting on public health they have accelerated our ability to understand important factors in the biology of infectious diseases such as the identification of determinants of virulence drug-resistance associated substitutions vaccine design and genomic epidemiology a powerful approach to integrate epidemiologic and genetic information in reconstructing transmission patterns and infectious disease dynamics gwinn et al 2019 ngs has also enabled pathogen discovery in a timely manner compared to traditional methods being essential to the virus taxonomic classification during the beginnings of covid-19 pandemics zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 this robust molecular information is also the raw material for the development and refinement of molecular and serological diagnostic methods wang et al 2020 and all sequence-based designs are susceptible to improvement as the virus disseminates and its genetic variability increases mutation is the fundamental source of genetic variation and rna viruses are particularly susceptible to have high mutation rates during the genome replication sanjuan et al 2010 therefore rna viruses display high substitution rates when analyzed through time although sequence identity between the analyzed genomes and the wuhan reference strain nc045512 was around 999 the estimate substitution rate for sars-cov-2 is in the range of 167467  103siteyear tang et al 2020 an enormous effort of every official and private laboratory around the word has led to the availability of hundreds of commercial kits and in-house protocols for the molecular detection and covid-19 diagnostic confirmation while this effort is welcome and some recommendations have been provided by regional agencies the availability of all these methods imply the need for an evidence-based criterion for decision-making about the best option at country level in this study based on ngs data of complete sars-cov-2 genomes from colombian cases timely evidence is provided on the genetic variability of representative strains of the circulating viruses in the country that should be considered for an evidence-based improvement of the routine diagnostic tests the majority of the evaluated in-house molecular assays displayed genetic stability at the primersprobes target regions however some these oligonucleotides displayed mismatches that were considered of minor or major importance for the test performance based on the in silico analysis some of the analyzed primersprobes displayed mismatches when compared to target sequences of some colombian sars-cov-2 strains polymorphic sites in the complete sars-cov-2 genomes obtained in this study were supported by sequencing depths between 123 and 390 sufficient to identify these sequence variations unequivocally the analyzed genome sequences corresponded to the early introduction and dispersion of the virus in the country it is expected that some of the identified nucleotide substitutions remain stable in subsequent transmission chains of the corresponding clusters of cases as demonstrated in the present study as character states shared by two or more sequences by the time of this report more than 31000 sequences have been made available on gisaid by researchers across the globe in line with the common primer check for high-quality genomes 2020-05-22 analysis from this database biigis 2020 the zhu 2020 cdc-china set ii n showed the higher percent of genomes with mutation in both the entire -and the 3 end primer region which can affect the sensitivity of this protocol given the genetic variability present in the country furthermore our analysis with the hong kong2020 hku-np showed excessive base mismatch against all tested genomes so it is highly recommended to improve the design of this probe prior to the arrival of sars-cov-2 in colombia the charit-berlin protocol described by corman and collaborators was established as a routine in detection corman et al 2020 following the recommendation of the pan american health organization paho their three molecular targets rdrp e and n genes were analyzed and rdrp displayed some conflicting nucleotide sites the antisense primer rdrp sarsr r1 presented a degenerate site at the nucleotide position 15519 equivalent to nucleotides g or c s while the reference and all colombian sequences displayed t at that position however this mismatch was expected not to affect seriously the overall stability of its hybridization there was an important finding in the sense primer rdrpsarsrf1 which displayed a mismatch at position 15451 when compared to the hcovcolombiavalledelcauca799432020 genome this mismatch located at the second base of the 3 end of the primer is expected to severely affect the primer hybridization and subsequent dna polymerase-mediated extension in the present study we propose to include a degenerate site r as follows rdrpsarsr-f2 mod 5-gtgaaatggtcatgtgtggcrg-3 thus covering the genetic variability and improving the thermodynamic stability with this genetic variant to avoid false-negative results table s2 the nucleotide identity of the colombian genomes with respect to the corman berlin 2020 e sarbeco and n sarbeco designs was 100 these results supported the paho recommendation of diagnostic confirmation based on the single e gene in the context of sustained transmission at high levels in this region where other coronavirus species of the subgenus sarbecovirus are expected to be absent paho 2020 another critical characteristic of the primersprobes of the current in-house protocols listed by who and assessed in the present study was the codon position at the 3 end of the sense and antisense primers in coding regions the major and minor susceptibility to nucleotide substitutions for the third and second codon positions respectively is widely known as any change at the 3 end can affect the primer hybridization it is highly recommended that this position aligns with the second preferable or first codon position some primers and indeed primer sets were found to be coincident with the third codon position despite not finding substitutions at these sites in the colombian strains that position is expected to be unstable through time genomic data available from this study allowed the in silico evaluationrefinement of the protocols for molecular detection of sars-cov-2 circulating in colombia it is highly recommended to establish routine molecular surveillance of the virus in order to determine the real impact of every mutation in the diagnostic tests performance paho 2020 finally the implementation of molecular tests at country-level should be supported by the estimation of the analytical sensitivity limit of detection lod in copiesreaction specificity corman et al 2020 and the accumulated genetic variability should be tested during the implementation of a molecular detection protocol including the clinical sensitivity in different biofluids corman et al 2016 reproducibility repeatability inter-operator inter-instrument inter-site and inter-batch assays hu et al 2019 detection of sars-cov-2 viral rna using nucleic acid amplification techniques such as rrt-pcr continues to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of covid-19 who 2020d however all sequence-based methods are susceptible to nucleotide substitution affecting the oligonucleotide hybridization efficiency and resulting in false negatives some of the in-house protocols analyzed in the present study require an experimental evaluation of their performance in the context of virus genetic variability the genomic data of this study allow the refinement or even the design of more precise and efficient protocols for the molecular detection of the genetic variants of sars-cov-2 circulating in colombia however more ngs data from colombian sars-cov-2 will be determinant to a better comprehension of the impact of genetic variability on specific molecular assays of routine use as the virus evolves the following are the supplementary data related to this article







 this study was funded by the instituto nacional de salud in bogot dc colombia the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest in the manuscript  does moral reasoning influence public values for health care priority setting a population-based randomized stated preference survey avram denburg e wendy ungar j shiyi chen jeremiah hurley julia abelson   age represents one of the most prominent issues explored in the literature on social values for health system resource allocation 11 12 13 14 15 16 the focus on age stems in part from the utilitarian assumptions that anchor prevailing methods of health economic evaluation 1718 quality-adjusted life years qalys have played a dominant role in assessing the value of health interventions as a universal metric for comparisons of benefit among different technologies that incorporate quantity and quality of life into a unified indicator closely allied to the use of qalys as an outcome measure in applied health economic evaluation is the assumption of utilitarian qaly maximization as a normative goal  and thus decision-criterion  when selecting the best alternative among competing interventions 19 the prominence of qaly maximization as a decision-criterion in applied health economic evaluation including by hta institutions internationally has prompted theoretical and empirical inquiry into the strength of societal preference for qaly maximization 20 21 22 23 moral philosophers and social choice theorists have challenged the moral legitimacy of purely consequentialist approaches to health care rationing including qaly maximization citing the relevance of ethical concepts ranging from distributive justice priority to the worst off and rights-based entitlements in health resource allocation 24 25 26 27 28 29 empirical studies of public preferences for health care resource allocation often employ recipient age as a proxy for qaly gains studies of public preferences have yielded considerable evidence favouring priority to younger populations 13 14 15 16 such studies have often compared adults of various ages select studies include a childhood age range among their comparators 1530313233 however few studies have explored public preferences for health resource allocation decisions related to children as such moreover the reasons underlying societal preference for the young remain incompletely understood crucial questions persist does qaly maximization drive precedence to the young or is it independent of life years gained are there other normative considerations at play how do different moral ideas guide age-based prioritization by study participants are there specific values that inform allocative decision-making about children a number of studies have tried to tease apart the normative presumptions behind age-based rationing decisions tsuchiya et al distinguish and test the evidence for different types of ageism underlying societal preferences for health resource allocation 1 health maximization ageism constant relative value of life-years irrespective of age 2 productivity ageism higher value of life-years in young adulthood related to greater social and economic productivity and 3 fair innings ageism emphasis on opportunity for equal aggregate lifetime health or qalys through priority to those expected to experience less such as the young or disadvantaged 16 each of these approaches is outcome-oriented and concerned with health gains though calibrated to prioritize different groups based on alternative ethical arguments health maximization ageism which corresponds to pure qaly maximization receives its strongest support in age-based stated preference studies that focus on life-saving interventions or those that result in more aggregate qalys for younger recipients even so evidence for societal disavowal of pure qaly maximization exists with some studies yielding majority preferences for equal allocation in the face of discrepant potential qaly gains across age groups 1733 importantly studies that test preferences for age-based allocation in terms of qaly maximization alone cannot discern whether distinct moral principles inducing priority to the young be it children or younger adults are at play when controlling for qalys gained the evidence in support of priority to younger groups is mixed stated preferences consistent with both fair innings ageism and productivity ageism are evident in select studies examining age-based trade-offs in the context of fixed benefits when the duration of benefit across age groups is standardized  thereby in effect neutralizing health maximization ageism or pure qaly maximization  consistent prioritization by age breaks down with participants alternately preferring allocation to children people in middle age or equal allocation across age groups 1516303435 it is however often difficult to disentangle evidence in support of one of these forms of ageism from the other in the extant literature in addition to studies of age-based priority setting that focus on health outcomes a number of studies explore the moral bases for allocative decision-making by examining the relevance of causes anand and wailoo demonstrate weak societal preference for consequentialist rationing rules including qaly maximization through experimental rationing decisions that force trade-offs between hypothetical adult recipients of different ages 17 notably they also empirically examine the relevance of deontological considerations in health care rationing including personal responsibility for ones health state socioeconomic status and procedural considerations in priority setting their work demonstrates a disavowal by participants of pure qaly maximization and highlights other salient normative considerations for potential incorporation into rationing exercises including equality of treatment individual rights and duties and procedural fairness 1736 relatedly a limited body of evidence points to the impact of embedded moral reasoning on attenuated public preference for the young suggesting that deliberation on a range of ethical principles can influence stated preferences for allocating resources based on age 10 however this evidence pertains to age variations amongst adults despite this focus on age as a morally relevant variable the extant literature contains little dedicated inquiry into allocative preferences regarding children per se 37 this lack of evidence has contributed to a vacuum of both theoretical and context-specific knowledge about societal preferences related to the prioritization of health system resources for children the need for more and better knowledge of public values attached to health care priority-setting affecting children is underscored by inherent challenges associated with the assessment of child health technologies 38 39 40 health system funding decisions for children are often constrained by limited evidence for the clinical efficacy or economic efficiency of child health technologies 41 childhood diseases are typically rare the conduct of research in pediatric populations is complex and standard metrics of clinical and economic assessment fail to incorporate unique dimensions of childhood such as family context and life-course impacts 142 greater uncertainty in clinical and economic domains may confer greater importance on public values in decisions about the prioritization of child health technologies in addition evidence of differences in public preferences for health resource allocation across the life course could strengthen standard approaches to the economic evaluation of health care technologies and services through enhanced incorporation of public values to better understand societal values for health resource allocation we conducted a population-based stated preference survey with a nested randomized controlled moral reasoning intervention our objective was to generate evidence to inform economic evaluation and policymaking on health care priority-setting and payment reform in developed health systems uniquely we sought to explicitly assess societal preferences for allocation to children and to test the influence of structured deliberation  in the form of an individual-level moral reasoning exercise  on allocative preferences our principal aims were to 1 understand the direction and strength of public preferences for health resource allocation between children and adults for varied treatment scenarios 2 assess the impact of a moral reasoning intervention on the expression of such preferences and 3 identify sociodemographic factors that impact the expression of public preferences on health resource allocation between children and adults we also sought to test the divergence of participant preferences for children or adults from an assumption of age-neutrality to understand the treatment scenarios within which significant preferences for either children or adults emerge finally we aimed to characterize the principles that most influenced participants allocative decisions to gain a deeper understanding of the moral reasoning behind societal preferences for health resource allocation in keeping with much of the prior literature on age-based resource allocation we expected that control group participants would display an aggregate mean preference for allocation to children particularly in scenarios where theoretical qaly gains were largest ie cancer treatment and eating disorders therapy in scenarios with fixed and equal life-year gains across children and adults ie chronic disease drug liver transplant we hypothesized that participant preferences for children would be less pronounced but persist on average due to intuitive conceptions of fair innings we included a palliative care scenario to test the direction and strength of age-based preferences in a context focused on relief of suffering rather than hypothetical qaly gains anticipating weak or no preference for allocation to children in terms of participant sociodemographics we presumed that younger adults and those with children of their own would preferentially favour allocation to children due to temporal and emotional proximity to childhood states in contrast to prior evidence demonstrating diminished preference for younger adults induced through moral deliberation 10 we hypothesized that a moral reasoning exercise would increase the strength of public preference for allocation to children as compared to adults this hypothesis was predicated on insights from foregoing normative analyses of public policies for children which have identified distinguishing characteristics of childhood  such as vulnerability dependency rarity social distinction and future potential  as drivers for policy development 43 44 45 46 47 48 we postulated that the moral reasoning exercise which incorporated a number of values-based considerations specific to children would prompt participants to consider their allocative preferences in light of these unique concerns given the ethical tools to unpack intuitions about what children might deserve relative to adults we anticipated that participants randomized to the moral reasoning arm would apprehend justifications for preferential allocation to children that may not be immediately apparent we further hypothesized that participants in the intervention arm would display stronger aggregate preference for children across all the clinical scenarios tested regardless of the duration of life years gained as a result of their access to a varied palette of ethical principles by which to justify preferential allocation to children including vulnerability dependency potential and social distinction we conducted a population-based stated preference survey of societal views on the prioritization of health resources among children and adults administered to a non-probability sample of canadian adults participants were recruited through letters of invitation emailed to a random sample from a panel of over one million canadians maintained by a survey research firm a limitation of non-probability sampling is the absence of general statistical theory to predict sample representativeness from survey design assumptions 49 to minimize sampling bias and maximize the potential for national population representativeness we employed interlocking quotas for stratified sampling age gender and region balanced against statistics canada norms and evaluated the composition of our final sample in comparison to the canadian population on a range of sociodemographic characteristics the survey was web-based and loyalty program rewards were offered to encourage participation development of the survey instrument drew on prior literature on the ethics of health resource allocation and social values relevant to child health policy the principles included in our moral reasoning exercise were derived from a systematic review of the literature on social values relevant to child health and social policy refined through an in-depth qualitative case study of health technology assessment and policymaking for children in canada 4748 iterative refinements to the survey were informed by a pilot phase with experts n  3 and laypersons n  2 and field testing with members of the public n  32 the final survey questionnaire directed respondents to assign numerical preference scores for the allocation of resources in different health care scenarios based on age-related criteria it presented each participant with the same five hypothetical treatment scenarios chronic blood disease liver transplant cancer therapy palliative care and eating disorder these scenarios were intended to provide variation in disease characteristics such as acuity morbidity mortality potential for cure and nature of treatment fig 1

 we fashioned principles to capture concepts identified as uniquely germane to health resource allocation involving adults and children including fair innings vulnerability dependency future potential and distinction as derived from a foregoing systematic review of social values relevant to health and social policy for children 47 balance was sought between principles that might inherently favour allocation to either children or adults participants in the intervention arm were asked to select the three principles that most influenced their choice in each scenario subjects in the control arm responded to the choice scenarios without exposure to a moral reasoning exercise to minimize question order bias we randomly rotated the order by which health care scenarios were presented to participants in addition we randomly rotated the order of principles within the moral reasoning exercise for the intervention cohort participants were prevented from revising their prior responses as they proceeded through the questionnaire quantitative survey data were imported into sas version 94 for analysis descriptive statistics were employed to characterize the respondent population and compare groups using the students t-test for continuous variables age and chi-squared for categorical variables we compared select sociodemographic variables from the overall sample with general canadian population demographics from the 2016 statistics canada census of population using one-sample proportion tests 50 we employed a linear mixed-effects random intercept model which allows for modelling of correlated continuous data to analyze the strength of participant preferences for each of the scenarios presented and examine the impact of experimental group scenario and sociodemographic variables on mean preferences scores while accounting for the correlation between repeated measures within the same subject the model examined 1 the difference in mean preference scores by group scenario and demographic characteristics and 2 the difference in mean preference scores between the intervention and control for each scenario we analyzed the interaction of group and scenario on preference scores to understand whether group mean preference scores varied by scenario type controlling for covariates including age geographic region gender language education employment income health and family structure emethods to further characterize the strength of participant preferences for children or adults and explore potential choice uncertainty we analyzed the proportions of respondents displaying any allocative preference beyond the bounds of a neutral construct zero midpoint and modelled differences in neutral versus preferential responses as a binary outcome between groups and across scenarios through generalized estimation equation gee modelling odds ratios with 95  confidence limits were computed to indicate the likelihood of a neutral response for each scenario using chronic disease as the reference scenario gee was also used to assess the likelihood of a neutral response by experimental group in each scenario with moral reasoning as the exposure lastly we quantified the proportion of respondents selecting each allocation principle overall and by scenario we tested equality of proportions across scenarios to detect significant differences in the proportions of respondents selecting a given allocative principle chi-squared analyses were used to compare the proportions of participants selecting each moral reasoning principle in a given scenario using one scenario chronic disease as a referent ethics approval was granted by the hamilton integrated research ethics board affiliated with mcmaster university informed consent was obtained online as part of the survey panel opt-in process prior to individual survey initiation the authors received no funding related to study design collection analysis and interpretation of data the writing of the report or the decision to submit for publication between april 18 and 24 2017 a total of 12803 individuals were screened for inclusion 10026 were deemed ineligible or declined to participate and 2777 individuals were randomized of these we excluded 1048 for incomplete surveys a total of 1729 623  respondents completed the survey 173 were subsequently excluded for poor quality eg racing our final sample included 1556 participants with 773 in the intervention group and 783 in the control group efig 1 respondent characteristics were similar across groups etable 1 as compared with 2016 canadian population census data our sample evinced an over-representation of individuals with higher educational attainment analysis of mean preference scores demonstrated a consistent aggregate preference by control group participants to allocate scarce health system resources to children across all trial scenarios fig 3

 when analyzing the difference in mean preference scores between experimental groups for each scenario the intervention had the largest absolute impact for the cancer therapy 094 95  ci 068121 p  00001 and eating disorder treatment 090 95  ci 063116 p  00001 scenarios reflecting the strength of preference for children in these scenarios in the control group the results demonstrated that younger respondents and parents had stronger preferences for allocation to children see etables table 2 table 3 for unadjusted and univariate model results where the benefits of an intervention were most obvious and different between adults and children  as they were in respect of life-years gained from cancer and eating disorders therapy  a choice to prioritize those benefitting most may have seemed easiest even in the face of exposure to competing moral principles this explanation is supported by theories of rational decision-making from the field of cognitive psychology that posit dual-process thinking distinguishing intuition from reasoning 51 52 53 the design of our study  including the survey format and pacing question framing and lay sample  may have induced intuitive responses from some participants in the face of complex moral problems characterized by inherent uncertainty in particular participants may have allowed more obvious differentiators such as discrepant benefits in length of life to intuitively shape their preferences rather than take the time and cognitive effort to work through conflicting moral choices in a rule-bound manner this is likely particularly true of those unexposed to the moral reasoning intervention and might explain why preference score differences between the intervention and control groups were largest in respect of cancer therapy and eating disorders treatment it may also explain why variance in preference scores narrowed consistently across scenarios in the intervention group as compared to the control group it is possible that this reduction in variance represents a reduction in choice uncertainty in the context of enhanced participant reliance on analytical reasoning induced by the study intervention proportions of neutral response score between -05 and 05 were consistently higher in the intervention group across all scenarios etable 4 univariate gee analysis revealed the impact of the moral reasoning intervention on preference neutrality across children and adults with neutral responses significantly more likely in the intervention group than the control group or  169 95  ci 145196 p  00001 when examining the impact of scenario taking chronic disease as the referent neutral responses were significantly more likely in the palliative care scenario or  127 95  ci 113143 p  00001 and significantly less likely in the eating disorder scenario or  063 95  ci 056 to 071 p  00001 the multiple regression gee model affirmed greater odds of preference neutrality in the intervention group as compared to the control group across all scenarios fig 4
 etable 5 two explanations for greater apparent preference neutrality in the intervention group are possible the greater predilection for neutrality in the experimental group may represent stronger endorsement of equality as a primary justification for resource allocation induced by exposure to a range of humanitarian principles including statements about equality relief of suffering and rule of rescue conversely participants may have found it difficult to resolve competing moral intuitions through reasoned deliberation particularly in the scripted and time-bound context of a survey greater preference neutrality in the intervention group could represent a tendency to reject a difficult moral choice between adults and children one that pulled responses closer to zero and limited stronger preferences to scenarios where obvious benefits such as differential qaly gains made the moral leap less daunting we made a conscious attempt to incorporate principles related to an array of individual and societal benefits and costs to induce reflection on the range of moral reasons one might consider germane to health system resource allocation we also sought balance between principles that might intrinsically engender preference for children or adults participants exposed to the moral reasoning exercise demonstrated remarkable consistency in their prioritization of principles for allocative decision-making the top three principles guiding participants allocative decisions were 1 treat equally 543639 2 relieve suffering 396 661  and 3 rescue those at risk of dying 37 408  in all cases except palliative care treat equally ranked number one with a proportion uniformly greater than 50  subjects deemed relieve suffering most important 661  in the context of palliative care followed closely by treat equally 639  the least endorsed principles 10  for assigning allocative preference were priority to rare diseases priority to special populations and priority based on societal productivity despite consistency in ranking of principles the proportion of participants selecting a given principle to guide allocative decision-making varied significantly across scenarios table 3
 as compared to the chronic disease treatment scenario the cancer therapy scenario prompted significantly more participants to cleave to principles that in theory justify preferential allocation to children opportunity to live a full life 247  vs 192  p  00028 duration of benefit 345  vs 195  p  00001 and concern for special populations 119  vs 74  p  00026 they also tended to disavow principles favouring allocation to adults including family responsibilities 142  vs 247  p  00001 and economic productivity 79  vs 16  p  00001 a similar pattern was observed for the eating disorder treatment scenario with the addition of vulnerability 361  vs 219  p  00001 to the principles endorsed by contrast in the palliative care scenario participants displayed significantly more concern for equality of treatment 639  vs 552  p  00005 and relief of pain and suffering 661  vs 396  p  00001 and less concern for fair innings the entitlement to a full lifespan or duration of benefit our study admits of potential limitations in relation to the survey instrument the brief statements used to evoke the meaning of each principle may have failed to capture its ethical nuances different framing of the principles may have led to different patterns of preference among participants however randomly varying the sequence of principles mitigated any ordering effect bias 6061 use of a continuous scale overlapping zero to measure the strength of allocative preferences in the context of a binary choice task fund either intervention a or b may have led some participants to misinterpret zero as a choice to allocate equal sums of money to each population rather than agnosticism about which intervention to fund we sought to mitigate this potential limitation through simple explicit scenario instructions however it is possible that misapprehension of the neutrality of preference state by some participants impacted our results the study was not designed to measure the time it took to read the principles in the moral reasoning intervention separately from completing the choice tasks this could have given a proxy sense of whether participants read and engaged with the ethical ideas and choices involved the assembly and composition of our study sample may have also limited the external validity of our results values endorsed by the canadian public may not reflect those of other polities the use of covariate-adaptive randomization to form balanced treatment groups with respect to relevant covariates has both benefits and inherent shortcomings use of stratified randomization may have permitted some selection bias and only balanced a limited number of potentially relevant covariates 62 more specifically the survey firm generated cohorts from an opt-in panel of eligible canadians recruited and incentivized through brand loyalty points programs some of the inherent selection bias associated with online opt-in panels was evident privileging those with higher education who are web literate however the lack of statistically significant impacts of education and income on preference scores in the multivariate model attenuates theoretical concerns about sociodemographic bias our study also has important strengths it is to our knowledge the first to experimentally examine the values behind health and social policy decisions about children their valence in relation to adult needs and priorities and their stability in the face of moral deliberation its randomized design and large heterogeneous population-based sample allowed for robust conclusions about the effect of the intervention on participant preferences our findings demonstrate a convincing relationship between exposure to a range of relevant moral principles and the priorities set this affirms the complexity of such decisions and the impact of ethical deliberation on them these findings challenge reflexive trust in survey-based preference elicitation and imply the need to complement such modalities with deliberative modes of public engagement on questions of social importance such as the allocation of scarce public resources in policy terms our work both supports and challenges conceptions of value in health care based primarily on qaly maximization dominant modes of health economic evaluation privilege interventions that maximize aggregate individual and societal utility typically in the form of the duration and magnitude of benefits reaped and the size of the population reached our results demonstrate a stronger preference for children in the hypothetical scenarios cancer and eating disorders in which the duration of benefit accrued mainly to children this may represent an underlying motivation by participants to maximize benefits however we also observed a strong inclination for equality and humanitarianism amongst study participants regardless of experimental group the three principles deemed most salient to priority-setting were equal treatment relief of suffering and rule of rescue none of these prioritizes age as a relevant variable each starts from a belief in the intrinsic value of all human life and resists grading that value by social context or circumstance our results therefore suggest the need to incorporate other values into health care priority-setting as some value frameworks for funding decisions have begun to do 63 the salience of these findings to priority-setting efforts in the context of public health emergencies  including access to scarce ventilators or drugs in the context of the covid-19 pandemic  is readily apparent they furnish empirical evidence for the adjudication and refinement of ethical frameworks for triage and resource allocation during the pandemic based on public values in canada 6465 efforts to incorporate a broader range of public values and preferences in health and social policy decisions also involve inherent risks among them is the need to confront and grapple with public attitudes that conflict with the fundamental normative or legal principles that structure most democratic societies including basic commitments to the protection of individual rights and nondiscrimination 66 future research to explore this tension and ways to resolve or address it is warranted allied to this our study affirms the importance of process in health care priority-setting exercises the opportunity to explicitly consider varied normative ideas appears crucial to informed allocative decisions based on public values the observed changes in public preferences in the face of competing moral principles imply the impact and potential relevance of structured opportunities for moral reasoning when making such consequential decisions this includes the potential value of deliberative public engagement to health policymaking particularly in domains where distinct ideas about the public good may compete specific to children few efforts to incorporate public deliberation in research and policy on child health and social policy priorities have prevailed to date in the face of resource scarcity evidence-informed child health and social policies will depend on the careful elicitation and integration of public values this and allied work bear potential relevance in social policy domains beyond health including public attitudes to deservingness attached to welfare state distributional policies in domains as diverse as labour markets and education 6768697071 crucial future areas of inquiry and application include the inclusion of child voices in research and policymaking and the exploration of social values for priority setting within public policies and programs for children our study underscores the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation of scarce health care resources extending evidence of this calculus to trade-offs involving children nevertheless it demonstrates the mutability of such preferences in the face of structured moral deliberation this finding has three main repercussions it furnishes a critical lens for the interpretation of stated preference surveys introduces a note of caution into dominant modes of health care funding allocation decisions premised on utility maximization and implies the value of deliberative methods as a complement to both we observed a strong inclination for equality and humanitarianism amongst study participants regardless of experimental group these moral impulses prevailed over consequentialist logic including priority to the young founded on aggregate benefit the stability of these principles in the face of changing allocative preferences signals their importance as public values  but it also hints at the complexity of values-based decision-making the public seems at face value to believe in equality of access and defend a set of shared human entitlements to care it also seems to assign intuitive priority to children the challenge of reconciling these convictions demands processes nimble enough to

motivated by historical and present clinical observations we discuss the possible unfavorable evolution of the immunity similar to documented antibodydependent enhancement scenarios after a first infection with covid-19 more precisely we ask the question of how the epidemic outcomes are affected if the initial infection does not provide immunity but rather sensitization to future challenges we first provide background comparison with the 2003 sars epidemic then we use a compartmental epidemic model structured by immunity level taken here as age classes that we fit on available data this allows to derive quantitative insights into the future number of severe cases and deaths  most relevant lessons from the course taken by the disease will take time in particular many perplexing questions have not yet found adequate answers that would be crucial for the design of optimal treatment policies and healthcare strategies both at the individual and societal level among these questions prominent ones are why are the mortality patterns so skewed toward higher ages what is the common denominator of the observed comorbidities that affect in a non-negligible way the outcome of the disease what is the size of the asymptomatic cohorts are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases a barrier or an accelerator of the disease propagation etc to these salient questions which deal with the present situation we should add questions relative to future outbreaks their severity and characteristics this is particularly important as health authorities have for obvious reasons focused on the design of vaccines despite the fact that vaccines are sometimes extremely difficult to obtain 17  in particular while a response to previous infections is usually protective it can sometimes be deleterious and result in severe outcomes see eg 16  answering many of these questions requires deep understanding of the immune response of the host whether innate or acquired at the cellular or humoral level recent research pointed out that it is critical to investigate previous history of interaction between host and infective virus strains 1  in this context the question of whether previous infection with coronaviruses is beneficial or detrimental to the immunity of the host is a matter of active debate see for instance 2 21 22  here we focus on the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement ade mechanism related to the more colorful name of cytokine storm ade corresponds to a situation where antibodies that normally alleviate the consequences of a viral infection end up doing the op-posite they fail to control the virus pathogenicity by failing to be neutralizing ie the antibodies are not able to kill the virus or even enhance its virulence either by facilitating its entry into the cell thus enhancing the viral reproduction potential or by triggering an extensive and misadapted reaction thereby causing damage to the host organs through hyper-inflammation cytokine storm several documented examples are known that give rise to ade in sars see 3  dengue see 11  hiv-1 25 to cite but a few this is even already documented in the case of covid-19 as the similarity with dengue fever has resulted in false-positive identification when using diagnostic tests based on serology see for example in singapore 26  let us illustrate the first two situations more in detail for dengue fever it is established that a previous infection with a virus belonging to a particular serotype family can cause adverse reaction upon re-infection with a virus from another serotype see 11  this unwanted outcome was demonstrated in a study that monitored two dengue fever outbreaks a first one in cuba in 1977 9  followed by a second one twenty years later 1997 12  being infected during the first epidemic was proven to negatively influence the outcome of patients infected in the 1997 epidemic with a dengue fever serotype that differed from that of 1997 to put this otherwise the acquired immune response was fit for a given serotype but detrimental upon challenge with a different serotype in the present context the large time lapse between the two dates is worth emphasizing irrespective of whether or not the challenge is or is not related to a different serotype we will call this situation a cuban hypothesis and discuss it below a misadapted immune response is not limited to infection by the dengue virus denv another documented ade case in animal models concerns the coronavirus family m bolles and his collaborators see 3  tested a coronavirus vaccine on animal models and the results differed depending on the age of the vaccinated animal while the vaccine provided partial protection against both homologous and heterologous viruses for young animal models the same performed poorly in aged animal models and was potentially pathogenic this shows that a faulty immune response can depend on the general maturation of the immune system with a significant age-dependent component at least four human coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 5  are known to be endemic they infect mainly the upper respiratory tract to these we must add the now well-known strains sars-cov-1 responsible for the 2003 epidemic mers-cov and sars-cov-2 if a cuban hypothesis is found to account for the persistent development of related diseases the challenge by any one of these viruses or novel variants may reach human populations in a variety of forms this dire anticipation prompted us to investigate the impact of such a scenario on the immune system status within the population at large in this context we address here the following questions in the absence of any relevant serological information we compared age-dependent case fatality ratios of the sars 2003 and covid-19 more precisely using data from 15 see 4 13 for additional data we computed the age-dependent death rate for all 1755 sars 2003 patients in hong kong the benefit of using this database is that is contains information on all patients and therefore has no representation bias for covid-19 such data is not yet available so we use the institut national dtudes dmographiques ined database 7 at the date of may 4th 2020 the two bases do not allocate cases exactly to the same age groups we grouped together the 5-year 2003 data to fit the 2020 ined 10year database ranges and on the other hand use uniform attribution for ages in the above 75 2003 hk class to fill two corresponding classes 70-79 and 80 the epidemic model we explored is the following any patient starts in a susceptible notation s class can progress to the exposed notation e class and then either to a severely infected label i or mild infected class including the asymptomatic and undetected individuals denoted m the mild infected progress to a mild recovered r m  class while the infected can either die class deceased d or recover class r the model is structured by immunity  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is

france as both the demographics of this part of the population and the transmission dynamics are very specific while the data used to describe the covid-19 dynamics in this setting is very uncertain mathematically the model is written see figure 1 for an illustration 1 with the notations to model the impact of previous infections on the next possible epidemic we have to take several facts into account while the sars 2003 had a negligible asymptomatic class see 14  the covid-19 has nonnegligible number of mild or even asymptomatic individuals those patients are usually not detected and their estimation is statistically challenging even more difficult is to extrapolate the state of the immune system after a mild or severe infection and how this can be translated to future immune unbalanced response our hypothesis is the following a coronavirus infection will sensitize all infected persons to future infections to quantify such an additional sensitivity we can only use data from the severely infected classes and take death as the extreme case of severity statistically within the group as a whole thus when we consider the severely infected persons this group experienced a deleterious alteration of their immune system which is quantified by the intensity of the outcome death we calculated using the data from sant publique france 20 obtained as r c  7070  922  7 05 we subsequently compared this rate with the natural death rate of the french population which is r n  0 9 following this approach we concluded that it would take f c  log1  r c  log1  r n  76 years of natural evolution to match the unfavorable outcomes of the group ie to observe the same death rate as that experienced for severe covid-19 patients as coronavirus infection is the cause of this outcome we extrapolated the outcome assuming that each covid-19 patient lost 76 years of immune function quality in what coronavirus adequate response is concerned this is not to be related to chronological or biological age on the other hand if we compare with the data from the e-cdc 6 concerning the whole set of covid-19 patients the rate r c becomes 25987137779  1886 and f c  19 28 years we see that there is a large uncertainty arising from the way we count the cases this is not specific to the situation we try to model but a very general difficulty in similar situations to simplify we considered that patients who had a first infection with sars-cov-2 will experience an alteration of their immune function relative to coronavirus infections or related medical conditions and that their immunity parameters will be similar to those of a patient in the next immunity class in the model 1-7 this means that a patient that ends up in r k or r m k will start the next epidemic as if being virtually in the group s k1 which means having d k1 and f k1 parameters even if his biological age is still be counted with those in the class s k  note that this assumption does not imply that the patients that had a mild form of covid will experience the next time a severe form there are still mild forms starting in s k  but only that the parameters f k  d k will change  cc-by-nc-nd 40

european countries france spain italy with respect to the hong kong results all curves share a common shape a constant null range followed by a marked exponential increase starting in the 30-39 age group for the 2003 data and 50-59 group for all countries in 2020 this 20 years shift at the onset of the exponential regime can be interpreted as resulting from the existence of a common cause situated approximately 30-40 years before 2003 and 50-59 years before 2020 that is between 1960 and 1970 that affected all people living at that date and which could explain why there are 30 respectively 50 years later affected by the coronavirus outbreaks in a more severe way since the cause occurred before 1970 people born after this date will have no fragility which is precisely what is seen in the plot we interpret this as an evidence that previous infection history can negatively impact the individual outcome of a future infection note that historically the 1960-70 decade is rich in epidemic  virus related events the hong kong flu of 1968-1969 that killed an estimated 1 million people worldwide but also the start of the identification of the four endemic human coronaviruses mid-1960s note that such a conclusion is consistent with recent investigations see 10 that showed that individuals are prone to repeated infection with coronaviruses with the unfortunate consequence that not only the immunity may vanish sometimes within a year but that the re-infection can be more severe data displayes in the figure 2 substantiates the same conclusion here we made use of the methodology described in section a and more specifically the formulas 16 and 19 to estimate the constants f k and d k  note that there is an important uncertainty in the mortality data especially for low aged groups which induces uncertainty in the estimations same is true for the overall epidemic size used as input in our model and took from 19  however the figures are generally in line with known results in particular the strong correlation between the presence of mild including asymptomatic cases and age see table 1 for details table 1 to estimate parameter d k we used formula 16 and the data from 8 to estimate f k we use 19 and data from ined to fit the total deaths for given attack rate  t  57 as in 19   here we compared the outcome in terms of deaths by age groups and severe cases by age groups of the cuban hypothesis described in section 31 namely under the assumption that a patient who had a previous infection will move to another immunity group we derived the distribution of deaths by age and severe cases by age computed as detailed in appendix a proposition 2 the results are plotted in figures 3 4 and 5 the mean death age goes down from 7913 to 7615 and the total number of deaths goes from 16705 up to 20481 226 even more spectacular the evolution of the number of severe cases goes from 134 000 up to 457 000 340 note that in both cases the results depend on the total epidemic infection rate which is between  t  57 present and the group immunity rate 1  1r 0 ie 70 for r 0  33 the hypothesis of a 70 infection  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license

secondary infection event note that since the ratio is time independent the time at which we compute it does not need to be specified we consider that after a first infection recovered individuals in r k and r m k will share the immunity parameters with individuals in the k  1 group we take r 0  33 from 19  use   11r 0 as total attack rate of the first infection within the population and the estimation method described in proposition 2 rate is probably too strong although mass vaccination may contribute to it so it should not be taken as an operational forecast but rather as an extreme scenario based on a epidemic model structured by immune function age groups we evaluate the probability for a per- son to become a severe case this quantitative parameter has a large incertitude because of the presence of asymptomatic cases and mild infections we used figures from the literature that imply that children are largely asymptomatic while the older age classes show up to 20 severe forms next we moved to the heart of our scenario namely the quantification of the immune function alteration induced by an initial sars-cov-2 infection similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon note first that the relatively controlled nature of the 2003 sars epidemic did not allow us to draw conclusions on how the 2003 epidemic influenced the infected too few cases by contrast if a sensitizing process in the immune response triggered by sars-cov-2 exists the pandemic nature of the 201920 covid-19 outbreak will likely have noticeable effects on the overall population health state in particular this implies that additional care has to be observed when validating vaccines against the covid-19 we developed a scenario meant to explore the consequences that a previous infection changed the likeliness to get a severe form when challenged by a new infection increasing the death risk of severe forms irrespective of the precise figures we expect that this could be used as a promising methodology to quantify the epidemiological impact of ade with coronaviruses as key examples the deterioration of the immune function can be evident on two occasions either when a second epidemic occurs or when submitted to a challenge the challenge can be very diverse not necessarily in the form of a fully-fledged epidemic but also a small infection with an endemic coronavirus

some presentations recalling the kawasaki syndrome 24 18 23  we present simulation data that quantify the possible impact of such a immune function evolution of course our model has many limitations and further investigation into the determinants of the immune dynamics is necessary to wholly the conditions of the correct and impaired immune response until this is carried over past covid-19 patients should not be considered as having a life-time permanent acquired immunity to sars-cov-2 or other coronaviruses we denote  k the proportion of people in class k within the total population at t  0 and make the convention that this is strictly positive otherwise the class is entirely deleted lemma 1 suppose that the initial state of the system 1-7 satisfies the relations then for any time t  0 and k l  1  k before giving the proof we note that if all quantities are strictly positive the hypothesis can be written in a more convenient form as  k l  1 k which is intuitively not surprising for instance the first identity says that at the beginning of the epidemic the probability for an individual to belong to the e k class is proportional to the number of people in the s k class moreover we can prove a stronger version of the hypothesis stating that the conclusion is true in an approximate sense even if the hypothesis is not verified with exponentially vanishing error in all cases this is true when s0s0    d0 1 which is a generally accepted hypothesis another remark is to be made on the different status of the two identities in 16  the first one allows to set the d k constants bacause the corresponding data deaths over deaths plus discharged is available on the contrary the second one is not of immediate use because the proportions of mild forms are not known to reasonable precision on the contrary 17 can be used to compute f k if an estimation of the relative instantaneous epidemic size  t in the equation below is available relative instantaneous epidemic size t  s0  st s0  note that the estimation 17 involves et which can only be computed after f k are known so in full rigor this is a fixed point procedure but in practice given the uncertainties in the value of  t we will neglect et for small values of  t and use the formula proof to prove the assertions we note that for instance equation 2 implies that for any t  0 with t a positive function that does not depend on k and l together with the hypothesis this proves the first part of 14  we see that even if the hypothesis is not verified the error term e k ts l t  s k te l t with respect to the conclusion will decay exponentially fast the second part of 14 follows from the formula s k t  s k 0e  t 0 m i d  the other parts are obtained in a similar way proposition 1 under the hypothesis

of the first covid-19 cases in eastern ontario canada march 18-30 2020 the reported genomes belong to the s-clade n2 and g-clade n23 of sars-cov-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein a phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within canada there may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples including at least three that were likely introduced from europe and seven from the usa in addition four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection these results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like sars-cov-2 earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics  the past two decades have seen the emergence of three novel betacoronaviruses that have been associated with outbreaks in the human population including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 1  middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov in 2012 2  and sars-cov-2 in 2019 3 4  all three coronaviruses appear to have originated from bats and likely were transmitted to humans by zoonotic transmission possibly through an intermediate vertebrate vector 5 6  corona virus disease -2019 covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the sars-cov-2 the first confirmed case dates to december 8 2019 in a patient from wuhan city in the hubei province of china 7  the virus quickly spread through wuhan and neighbouring parts of hubei province despite rapid and aggressive public health interventions 8  the following months led to global spread of the virus and was officially classified as a pandemic by the who on march 11 2020  the spread of sars-cov-2 has had devastating consequence to human health with over 912 million documented cases and 473797 deaths as of june 24 2020 including 101637 confirmed cases and 8436 deaths in canada who situation report number 156 sars-cov-2 is a spherical enveloped particle positive-sense single stranded rna genome that is 299 kb in length 3 9  genome organization of sars-cov-2 has the characteristic gene order 5replicase orf1ab spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n-3 6  coronavirus s proteins bind the host receptor enabling viral entry to the cell and have demonstrated the highest sequence variability in the viral genome 10  the s protein in both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 interact with the hosts angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 11  however the spike protein in sars-cov-2 has 10-to 20-fold higher binding affinity than sars-cov 12  the complete sars-cov-2 genome was published on jan 12 2020 from a patient in wuhan china 3  the collaborative effort of many labs around the world have now published the genomes of many sars-cov-2 genomes including 53992 in gisaid wwwgisaidorg 24438 in ncbi wwwncbinlmnihgov and 7989 in vipr wwwviprbrcorg as of june 24 2020 allelic differences with biased geographic distribution have been observed between three major sars-cov-2 clades likely the consequence of founder effects 13  superclade i a superset of vclade defined in gisaid epicov portal 14   has limited variability with respect to the reference genome and has been described in the majority of isolates in asia 13  superclade ii s-clade has two characteristic variants at c3037t and t28144c 13 and includes most viral isolates from the usa especially the west coast 13 15  superclade iii g-clade has four characteristic variants at c241t c3037t c14408t and a23403g 13  and includes most viral isolates from europe and many on the east coast of the usa 13 15  the a23403g mutation results in a d614g substitution in the s protein which may result in increased fitness as this viral strain is rapidly and repeatedly replacing other forms of the virus around the globe 16  this mutation is also embedded in an immunological epitope which elicited antibody production in patients during the 2003 sars-cov epidemic 17  and may mediate antibody escape making individuals susceptible to a second infection of covid-19 16  databases containing tens of thousands of sars-cov-2 genomes provide an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct the establishment and spread of the virus in specific locales we demonstrate the ability to trace the origin and community spread of sars-cov-2 using sequence data from twenty-five viral genomes isolated from some of first cases of covid-19 in the eastern region of the province of ontario canada this knowledge may improve the effectiveness of public health interventions to prevent future pandemics sample collection nasopharyngeal np swabs were collected in viral transport media from symptomatic patients being tested for sars-cov-2 at kingston health sciences center khsc and the surrounding hospitals extraction of total rna from viral transport media was performed using the maxwell rsc whole blood rnadna kit promega corporation madison wi on the maxwell rsc 16 automated nucleic acid extractor each sample was tested for the presence of sars-cov-2 using a laboratory developed multiplex real-time pcr assay targeting the envelope e and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp genes 18 on the viia7 real-time pcr system sars-cov-2 genome sequencing the extracted nucleic acids from covid-19 positive cases were anonymized and shared with queens genomics lab at ongwanada q-glo rna from each sample 5 l was reverse transcribed to complimentary dna using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit on a simpliamp thermal cycler libraries were constructed manually using the ion ampliseq sars-cov-2 research panel ion xpress barcodes and the ion ampliseq library kit plus following the manufacturers recommendations including amplification cycles based on viral load templating and chip loading were performed on the ion chef system using the ion 510  ion 520  ion 530 kit-chef up to sixteen samples were multiplexed on an ion 530 chip and sequenced using the ion genestudio s5 plus semiconductor sequencer chart review demographic data and travel history were extracted from a review of laboratory requisitions hospital charts and public health case investigation charts assessment of linked cases were based off public health case investigation charts data analysis preliminary analysis was performed on a torrent suite server and using custom plug-ins created by thermofisher scientific specifically for the ion ampliseq sars cov-2 panel including assemblertrinity for genome-guided assembly of the viral genome irmareport to build a consensus sequence and covid19annotatesnpeff to annotate variants vcf files generated by torrent suite variant caller were filtered to remove eleven variants with read depth less than 1000 and quality score less than 400 filtered variants were used for sample clustering with the maximum likelihood tree 19 in molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega software 20 21  phylogenetic analysis a data analysis pipeline using molecular phylogenetics was developed to reconstruct infection origins and spread utilizing two main assumptions first identical sequences are identical by descentthat is the same variants are unlikely to have evolved independently second new mutations accrue at an average rate of 1 base pair bp every 7 to 21 days this is based on an average of 24225 bp substitutions per year in the nextstrain analysis 22 of the gisaid 1423 database briefly the viral genome sequenced from each patient was used as the query sequence in a blast 24 search against a local reference containing 25132 sars cov-2 genomes from the gisaid database accessed may 15 2020 only highly similar sequences with no more than two mismatches were retained from the database reducing the number of reference genomes from 25132 to 1251 many references were identical genomes isolated in separate individuals which were collapsed to 72 unique reference sequences a reference sequence from wuhan wuhan-hu12019 was added to root the phylogenetic tree fifty-nine of these 72 reference sequences shared the same common ancestor but differed by one or two substitutions or otherwise formed derived groups that were not informative to reconstructing the ancestry of the sample genomes these extraneous tips were removed leaving only the patient-derived genomes and 13 unique and informative ancestral sequences phylogenies were built using the ape v53 package in r using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the optimpml function with 100 bootstrap iterations the ggtree v201 and ggplot2 v321 packages in r were used to generate tree visualizations sample demographics including age and biological sex are shown in table 1  at time of analysis thirty-two sars-cov-2 samples from local cases of covid-19 were made available however seven samples did not pass quality control insufficient viral load or low sequencing coverage and were excluded from further analysis for the remaining twenty-five samples an average of 13 million mapped reads per sample was generated with an average of 8175 mean read depth and 9606 uniform coverage supplementary table 1  twenty-one samples have 100 coverage of the genome and four samples have greater than 994 coverage samples 19 and 21 had the lowest uniformity in coverage which resulted in several gaps in the consensus sequence so these two sequences were removed from phylogenetic analysis most viral genomes contained between six to eight variants when compared with the nc0455122 reference genome with greater number of variants reported in sample 41 10 variants and sample 36 12 variants the most common nucleotide substitution is from cysteine to thymine 2545 variants followed by guanine to thymine 745 variants and adenine to guanine 445 all the shared variants are homozygous variants except for heterozygous snp in the orf1ab gene of samples 11 and 30 c9994a we see an additional four heterozygous variants in three samples that are unique to that sample supplementary table 2  finally we observe one shared missense variant g25217t and three unique synonymous variants c24382t t24982c c25357t in the gene encoding the s protein clustering of the 25 viral sequences within the maximum likelihood tree fig 1a is driven by variants that are shared between samples  fig 1b and branch length is driven by unique variants carried by each sample supplementary table 2  the samples formed two large clades including two samples that carry two mutations that correspond to the s-clade c8782t and t28144c and twenty-three samples that carry four mutations reported in the g-clade c241t c3037t c14408t and a23403g within the g-clade we see smaller clusters that correspond to cluster 2 samples 17 18 24 25 26 37 38 39 and 42 cluster 5 samples 1 10 and 12 and cluster 9 samples 2 4 11 16 29 30 34 35 36 and 41 reported by korber et al 16  phylogenetic analysis using local patient sars-cov-2 genomes were matched with blast to reference sequences published in the gisaid database this resulted in 13 ancestral genomes relevant to retracing the origins and spread of local covid-19 cases fig 2  sample 23 belongs to the s-clade of sars-cov-2 and is derived from the ancestral genome shared by reference 1 samples sharing this genome are almost exclusively from north america and predominately from the usa supplementary table 3  samples 1 10 and 12 belong to the gclade cluster 1 this clade contains ancestral reference genomes 16 39 46 68 69 and 70 reported all over the world but over-represented in europe especially the uk and spain reported travel history supports european origin in these three samples  table 2  the other nineteen samples in the g-clade cluster 2 are derived from several ancestral sequences 3 14 53 57 67 72 which are predominantly from north american usa patients reported travel history supports an american origin of infection for patients 34 and 41 who reported visiting the usa before being diagnosed with the virus  table 2  within the g-clade 2 samples we observed four clusters of two or more samples with the same viral genome indicating a common source of infection fig 2 table 2  we analyzed twenty-five sars-cov-2 genomes from cases of covid-19 within the eastern region of the province of ontario canada these samples included most of the first cases in the region and therefore infection was assumed to have occurred during international travel or while in proximity to an individual who had recently travelled genome variation among these samples has important implications for the pathology and epidemiology of this disease as discussed below a major concern with novel viruses is mutation rates and how novel mutations will affect virulence vaccine development and reinfection 15 16 17 25 26  of primary significance are mutations in the s protein because the spike protein defines viral host range and is often the target of neutralizing antibodies 27 28  this project identified three novel unique mutations in the coding region of the s protein however all three are predicted to be synonymous and likely will not affect viral virulence or epitopes a fourth polymorphic site at c25217t occurs in four samples 2 4 34  and 16 is a missense variant resulting in a glycine to cysteine substitution at the 1219 th residue of the s protein in silico modeling or functional validation studies may describe the impact of this mutation on the function of the transmembrane domain this project identified five heterozygous variants c360t c9729a g10818t g17325t c18136t four of these heterozygous variants were unique to one sample and had alternate allele frequencies ranging from 25-39 suggesting an emerging viral mutation that occurred since infection of the host however one heterozygous variant c9729a was shared between two samples samples 11 and 30 and had an alternate allele frequency of 058 and 059 indicating that these two individuals likely have superinfection of two sars-cov-2 strains 29  clustering of shared mutations identified two samples 21 and 23 that belong to the sclade of virus and characterized by two polymorphic sites at c8782t and c28144t 13  the presence of three additional polymorphic sites at c17747t a17858g and c18060t exclusively present in north america 26 support a north american origin for these two samples furthermore phylogenetic analysis identified potential ancestral samples for sample 23 that were predominately isolated in the usa the other twenty-three samples share four shared polymorphic sites at c3037t c14408t a23404g and a23403g and belong to the g-clade of viruses 13  within the g-clade we observe two distinct clusters g-clade 1 which appears european in origin and g-clade 2 which appears to originate in the usa reported travel history supports our phylogenetics analysis for european origin for the g-clade 1 as sample 1 reported recent travel to portugal sample 10 travelled to ireland and sample 12 to spain similarly reported travel history supports north american origin for the g-clade 2 as sample 34 reported recent travel to florida usa and sample 41 reported recent travel to arizona usa these correlations between phylogenetic origin and reported travel history indicates how viral genome sequencing can successfully trace the origin of sars-cov-2 infections into canada interestingly we observed several clusters of samples that shared the same viral sequence indicating that these samples either had a shared source of infection or a result of community transfer chart review demonstrated that samples 24 25 and 26 did not travel outside of canada they are contacts of each other and share the same sars-cov-2 strain demonstrating community transfer in eastern ontario was likely even during the early stages of infection similarly samples 17 38 39 and 42 all share the same viral strain but the connection between these individuals is unknown identification of the common thread among these patients or other clusters of cases could help to identify major sourcespathways of infection infection in sample 34 is likely attributed to their travel to the usa table 2  however samples 4 and 34 share the same viral strain and sample 4 tested positive for covid-19 five days earlier than sample 34 a connection between sample 4 and 34 is unknown as are the travel details of sample 34 but these observations raise the possibility that infection in sample 34 may not be related to their travel to the usa these results demonstrate how sample clustering and phylogenetic analysis based on viral genome sequencing may assist and prioritize case and contact tracing to further monitor and contain the spread of the virus there were several limitations in using genomics to trace viral origin and path of transmission of sars-cov-2 first in the early stages of the pandemic most countries were only screening and testing international travelers who displayed symptoms this allowed asymptomatic carriers to go undetected masking potential sources of infection as a result gaps exist in the databases reporting sars-cov-2 genomes masking the true sources of infection however the rapid publication of genome sequences from around the world can help to offset this limitation by identifying geographical clusters and specific genomic variants that are shared across regions the relatively high mutation rate helps to distinguish primary and secondary infections in the span of one to two weeks a second limitation is a lack of detailed travel and interaction histories for patients due to differences in reporting and data collection among collection sites and agencies rigorous adherence to standardized data collection protocols like whos guidance for contact tracing in the context of covid-19 coupled with genomics data as described here may facilitate effective contact tracing that is required to break the chains of viral transmission a final limitation is that sequencing sars-cov-2 in covid-19 cases with low viral load was problematic due to lack of rna input for library construction as seen by the number of excluded samples and those with low coverage uniformity samples 19 and 21 however this will become less limiting over time as high-throughput sequencing devices continue to improve in sensitivity and throughput in summary this is the first description of sars-cov-2 genomes in covid-19 positive cases in eastern ontario these are many of the first detected cases in eastern ontario and infection was believed to be foreign in origin and the result of international travel or proximity to an individual who had travelled this analysis illustrates that many of the infections originated from our geographical neighbour the usa but other sources of infection include several countries in europe we also observed community transfer in cases that did not travel out of the country these results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units to track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like sars-cov-2 earlier detection and screening and alternative modes for contact tracing may improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics table 2  summary of viral origin of first covid-19 cases into the eastern region of the province of ontario canada phylogenetic analysis determined viral origin based on ancestral sequences in the gisaid database and correlated with patients reported travel history samples with identical viral genome sequences are grouped into a single cluster and may represent shared origin or

in pfu per milliliter adherent vero cells were infected with 5 x 104 pfuml of sars-cov hsr1 at the third passage in a t-75 flask twenty-four hours after infection vero cells were detached from the tissue culture flask with a cell scraper and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 173 x g for 4 min the pellet was resuspended in pbs without ca and mg and the suspension was spun at 173 x g for an additional 4 min the cell pellet was resuspended and fixed in 4 formaldehyde and 25 glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer and incubated for 5 min at room temperature the sample was then centrifuged at

deerfield il stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and metaled the ultrathin sections of infected vero cells were observed through transmission electron microscopy hitachi h7000 sequencing of the complete sars-cov hsr1 genome was performed by using 68 partially overlapping primers encompassing the whole viral genome a 5 rapid amplification of pcr ends race technique was performed to

and hku-39849 ay278491 sequences were trimmed to equivalent length and phylogenetic relationships were estimated with paup maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods by using the p-distance model and mega version 21 trees were edited by using treeview both nested rt-pcr and the real-time rt-pcr assays performed on the sputum sample from a person with sars tested positive for sars-cov rna the viral load in the sample was estimated to be 56 x 104 sars-cov rna copiesml twenty-four hours after injection of vero cells with the sputum sample a strong cpe was observed as indicated in figure 1b the cpe was diffused with cell rounding with refractive appearance and the cell monolayer was destroyed as compared to control uninfected vero cells figure 1a the viral load in the culture supernatant 24 hours after injection with the clinical sample was 13 x 105 copiesml as determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr serial passage of the virus on vero cells to obtain a tertiary viral stock yielded 91 x 108 copiesml a plaque assay was optimized to determine the in vitro infectivity of sars-cov the tertiary viral stock tested 25 x 106 pfuml in the plaque assay suggesting that about 360 genomes were required to generate a single plaque in tissue cultures at least under the conditions described here we also used the plaque assay for testing the potential inhibitory effect on virus infectivity of a single concentration of heparin the prototypic compound of a class of inhibitors of virus entry for enveloped viruses including hiv type 1 hiv-1 14 and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 hsv-1 and 2 15 heparin indeed reduced the formation of plaques by 50 when added 30 min before infection of vero cells with 100 pfuml of the sars-cov figure 2 thin-section electron microscopy showed the typical features of intracellular cov particles cells were engulfed with viral particles localized in cytoplasmic vesicles figure 3a this feature is typical of all coronaviridae viruses that bud intracellularly at membranes of the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi complex whereas newly assembled virions reach the cell surface by vesicular transport 16 after the extracellular release virus particles were found in large clusters adjacent to the plasma membrane as evidenced in figure 3b overall the ultrastructural analysis documented that sars-cov cultivated in vero cells behaved like a typical coronavirus characterized by intracellular budding figure 3 panels c and d the sequence of sars-cov strain hsr1 genomic rna was 29751 bases in length with a polyanion tail we identified the major open reading frames orfs coding for the 4 major structural proteins namely spike s envelope e matrix m nucleocapsid n gene products and at least other 10 proteins including a few of unknown function the complete sequence of sars-cov strain hsr1 has been deposited in the genbank database genbank accession no ay323977 this sequence was aligned with those of the other 21 sars-cov isolates to facilitate phylogenetic analysis overall the mean difference in nucleotide composition between all the isolates was 18  1 nt variations within the whole genomes thus confirming the genetic conservation observed previously 9 on the whole 149 sites were variable among the 22 aligned isolates and 24 loci in the viral genome varied in more than one isolate including in the sars-cov hsr1 genome recurrent mutations eleven of 24 recurrent mutations were silent whereas 3 of 13 mutations generating amino acid substitutions were observed within the n-terminal domain of the spike glycoprotein gene positions 21722 22223 and 22423 determining a g to d an i to t and a g to r amino acid change respectively six mutations were detected in the replicase gene positions 8572 9404 9479 9854 17564 and 19084 determining a v to l a v to a a v to a an a to v a d to e and a t to i amino acid change respectively and 1 mutation was found in the matrix protein position 26600 determining an a to v amino acid change the phylogenetic analysis was also performed by using the maximum parsimony method considering only sequence variants that recurred in more than one strain in order to reduce the mutational noise caused by pcr or sequencing mistakes figure 4 shows the phylogenetic tree obtained with the maximum likelihood method the maximum parsimony trees produced the same structure with minor changes in the subtrees branch patterns data not shown in these analyses sars-cov hsr1 appears to be strongly related to strains isolated from patients who had traveled from hong kong to different geographic areas singapore canada vietnam and spread the infection to their home countries in a few cases the isolation of a novel cov in persons with sars and proof of its etiologic role in this disease underscore the importance of identifying the pathogenic determinants of sars-cov this information may be central to plan specific therapeutic and preventive strategies against sars major areas of research include the following 1 analyzing growth characteristics of sars-cov in vitro 2 evaluating virus-host relationships at the molecular level 3 understanding both sars-cov genome organization and the role of nonstructural proteins of unknown function 4 studying the evolutionary relationships of different coronaviruses of animal and human origin and 5 identifying targets for anti-cov chemotherapy and vaccination in our study we characterized a novel isolate of sars-cov designated hsr1 strain the analysis of the complete sequence of sars-cov hsr1 genome showed the same organization in orfs previously described in this novel human virus 10 and confirmed the relative genetic stability among the different isolates 9 however for other sars-covs isolates amino acid changes were observed in this hsr1 strain at the level of the n-terminal domain of the spike glycoprotein the viral replicase and the matrix protein despite this relative stability phylogenetic analysis of the hsr1 isolate figure 4 has shown that the virus is more related to the strains isolated in patients who had traveled from hong kong to different geographic areas such as singapore canada and vietnam than to the beijing isolates in addition we have observed that other biomolecular features shared by most coronaviridae coexist in sars-cov hsr1 with particular characteristics that seem to be unique of the novel virus in particular sars-cov is able to replicate in vero cells with a rapid production of high virus titers and fast cpe by using quantitative molecular and biologic assays we could estimate that under our experimental conditions 360 genomes are approximately required to form a plaque of infectivity in vitro sars-cov seems unlike most of the other respiratory coronaviruses infecting humans which fail to grow efficiently in tissue cultures and are easily detectable by using pcr amplification methods only 17 infection in vero cells showed most of the usual characteristics of the cov replication 16 including intracellular budding of virions as demonstrated by electron microscopy to investigate whether sars-cov could be inhibited by polyanions we tested the effects of the prototypic sulfated polysaccharide heparin figure 2 on in vitro infection incubation of vero cells with heparin 100 gml 30 min before sars-cov injection curtailed infection by 50 polyanions have demonstrated antiviral activity 18 against enveloped viruses such as hiv and hsv through specific interaction with cells and after inhibition of virus attachment and entry 14 heparin a prototypic polyanion inhibits attachment and entry of virus particles into cell by impeding the interaction of the v3 region of gp120 with hiv specific chemokine coreceptor 19 in the case of hsv heparin inhibits the interaction of some hsv envelope glycoprotein to the heparan sulfate that mediates viral attachment to the target cell surface 2021 the partial inhibition of sars-cov hsr1 by heparin suggests that the envelope proteins coating the sars-cov virions might be endowed with positively charged amino acids that could interact with negatively charged sulfate groups present on heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on the surface of target cells vero cells the target of both hsv and dengue 4 22 replication replicate sars-cov more efficiently than several other cell lines in conclusion our study characterized a novel sars-cov isolate which was to date the second isolate obtained in europe the sequence analysis indicates that sars-cov hsr1 clusters together with the hong kong singapore and canada isolates the coexistence of general coronavirus features with important biologic and molecular specificity of sars-cov together with the evidence that sars-cov does not appear to be linked to any of the other three genetic groups of known coronaviruses strongly suggests it represents a new fourth genetic coronavirus group with distinct genomic and biologic features in light of this evidence efforts to identify new types of animal coronaviruses as well as to better understand the peculiarities of sars-cov are important in addressing its possible animal origin and in understanding the biology of coronaviridae and their evolutionary features  has the covid-19 pandemic affected mps representational activities royce koop kelly blidook lesley fuga anne   we found that covid-19 has affected mps connection-building representational activities most importantly the pandemic resulted in an increased emphasis on constituents requests for service from mps which limited the diversity of representational practices normally found among mps while some mps already prioritize service connections this became the case during the pandemic for all mps we interviewed supplanting other types of connections as mp francis scarpaleggia puts it were in full service mode as opposed to say debate mode while some mps indicated a decline in their usual policy work others said there has been no decline but that increased service demands have simply increased the hours of work overall andor altered what gets prioritized i think the amount of legislative work were doing has not really diminished argues a government mp its pretty much the same except were also doing an influx of constituency work a volume of constituency work thats increased quite dramatically the physical distancing regulations and restrictions on public gathering necessitated by covid-19 make it difficult for mps to build and maintain symbolic ties with their constituents by attending events and being present in the community as mp ken mcdonald notes
i miss the face-to-face because i could be at a seniors dinner in carbonear and there could be 150 people there so you get to mingle and speak to a lot of them face-to-face most of it is a cordial greeting or someone might have an issue that they want to talk to you about so this doesnt get done face-to-face nowpolitics is like many other human activities its a human-to-human interaction mp kenny chiu expands i need to have coffee with i need to talk to i need to shake hands  with constituents stakeholders and colleagues and mp alexandra mends links the importance of face-to-face communication to characteristics of her constituency arguing that non-verbal communication is extremely important for interacting with constituents in her highly diverse urban riding in response many mps have adopted new techniques to keep in touch and maintain linkages with constituents mps talked about webinar town halls and other online forums as ways to continue communications mp jenica atwin for example reports that 160 people had attended a recent local webinar while some mps are eager for the pandemic to end so they can get back to their normal operations others noted that some of the shifts in their representational approaches may outlast the pandemic mp churence rogers for example suggests
 theres a lot of things about this covid pandemic that will maybe change the way that i do the job in the future he expands  to leave my home and drive to grand bank its like four hours so if mayors and municipal councillors want a meeting about a particular issue my executive assistant and i can set up a zoom meeting and we can spend extra time in the meeting because now we dont have to spend eight hours driving we also heard from some mps that they are developing new representational connections with various local populations mp iqra khalid for example reports that the pandemic has resulted in requests for assistance from local businesses which generally have not contacted the mps office in the past the predominant shift in representational behaviours reported by the mps we interviewed is in their approach to building and maintaining service connections with their constituents we observed three main ways the daily service work of mps has changed first mps volume of casework increased dramatically regardless of whether they typically prioritize service connections all the mps we interviewed were experiencing surges in service needs with many adding that their ottawa staff are currently assigned to constituency matters as mp atwin explains our offices have never been busier  phone calls emails or messages through the various platforms so theres lots of points of contact every day  the volume has certainly increased exponentially second the substance of the service work performed by mps and their staff has changed during the pandemic typically mps and their staff develop the knowledge and skills to help constituents with a fairly narrow set of concerns covid-19 quickly spawned a host of government programs and regulations generating new service concerns from constituents and increasing the immediacy with which offices need to respond4 as an ndp mp notes
my caseworkers have been inundated with casework normally the majority of casework that comes is around immigration now the vast majority on top of the immigration pieces that weve been helping people with is actually covid-19-related questions either people who are trying to access the benefits that are available through the federal government or a lot of people who are falling through the cracks of those programs mp mike lake similarly adds that other service cases have often taken a backseat  the priority from the government side is around covid and so the typical things that weve dealt with  are completely different in terms of timeframes basically a lot of the regular stuff is on hold the urgency of covid-related service needs was emphasized by many of the mps we interviewed this has to get done now said mp raquel dancho of these requests there is no putting this off people are suffering people are not being heard finally covid-19 has changed the way mps gather and act on concerns normally mps receive service requests via email phone calls walk-ins to constituency offices and unplanned or chance meetings at events or on the street staff or the mp then work with constituents to address these concerns when covid-19 resulted in the closing of riding offices in addition to adapting to the increased volume and novelty of service requests mps and staff alike had to adjust for the most part adjusting has meant working remotely from home this entails increased use of technology more staff and caucus meetings and sometimes working without a dedicated office space among the demands of family while mps generally reported that operational practices transitioned well from constituency offices to remote settings the loss of foot traffic deprived mps of in-person contact with constituents which is a key element of some members representational style while mps representational styles focus to varying degrees on policy service symbolic and party connections the covid-19 pandemic has tended to shift mps behaviours heavily toward service across parties and jurisdictions mps emphasized the need to provide service to aid and inform constituents on matters related to covid-19 in this way covid-19 has affected the nature of representational work undertaken by mps during the crisis the loss of opportunity to make significant strides in non-covid-related policy and symbolic connection building during the crisis portion of the pandemic was discussed most by those mps who prioritize those types of connections and their frustration was often evident there is preliminary evidence that the changes we observed in canada are also taking place in other democracies that employ single-member units of representation in a larger study of representational practices currently underway mps in australia and new zealand told us that similar restrictions to those implemented in canada caused a focusing of their time and energy toward direct service to constituents also similarly while many saw benefits to take forward from their experiences with new media most mps expressed concern about a loss of in-person contact with constituents once in office mps engage in experiential learning about being a representative or learning through reflection on doing koop et al 2018 2425 over time such learning shapes mps representational behaviours the covid-19 pandemic constitutes a dramatic period of learning for canadas mps this study illustrates how mps have been both flexible and responsive to the changes in representational demands posed by covid-19 it also provides an opportunity to revisit the views of mps from the first few months of the covid-19 pandemic once it is clearer what its long-term effects upon politics and society will be  postnatal

pancreatic  cell function fen zhang chang liu lei wang xi cao ying wang ying jin yang kui   diabetes is a chronic metabolic syndrome caused by insulin deficiency and resistance there are 200 million diabetic individuals in the world with only approximately one-half being diagnosed and these numbers are expected to double by 2030 the disease often results in long-term microvascular neurological and macrovascular complications including retinopathy nephropathy neuropathy and increased risk of cardiovascular disease excessive activation of angiotensin ii angii is an important underlying mechanism for the development of diabetes and ang 1-7 is hypothesized to counteract it furthermore the renin-angiotensin system ras is significantly involved in the development of diabetes and its complications the activation of ras causes pancreatic  cell dysfunction by suppressing pro-insulin biosynthesis glucose-stimulated insulin secretion gsis and first phase insulin secretion 12 as well as by increasing islet fibrosis 3 and oxidative stress 4 the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2-angiotensin 1-7 ang 1-7-mas axis is suggested to have an antagonistic effect on the ras while ang 1-7 is the main antagonist of angii angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor acei and angiotensin receptor antagonist arb can alleviate these pathological changes 357 also several clinical experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of ras blockade in reducing the onset of diabetes 811 in 2006 it was demonstrated that patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars were more inclined to exhibit higher blood glucose 12 and this may be partly due to the fact that ace2 is a functional receptor for the sars coronavirus 13 thus we hypothesized that the ace2-ang 1-7-mas axis has a protective effect on pancreatic  cell function our previous study demonstrated for the first time that loss of ace2 led to impaired glucose homeostasis in mice in addition ace2 knockout ace2-y mice exhibit progressive impairments in glucose tolerance and reduced first-phase insulin secretion 14 the present study aimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects accordingly ace2 gene therapy improved glycemic control in diabetic mice via ang 1-7 15 ang 1-7 is hypothesized to exhibit antioxidant effects in diabetic nephropathy hypertension cardiovascular diseases and in the brain 1619 these data confirm the protective role of the ace2-ang 1-7-mas axis in the pancreas and establish a novel target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus oxidative stress is one of the most important factors in  cell loss 20 however little is known regarding the correlation between ang 1-7 and oxidative stress in the pancreas in the present study the protective effect of ang 1-7 on oxidative  cell damage was investigated the protective effect was shown to occur by improving gsis glucose stimulated calcium gsca responses and the mitochondrial membrane potential mmp which was demonstrated previously 21 and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species ros the selective receptor antagonist a779 was used to confirm the protective role of ang 1-7 ins-1 insulinoma cells

10000 cells from each well were analyzed by flow cytometry ex 490 nm em 590 nm color change from green to red indicated an increase in the mmp or the improvement of mitochondrial function statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 5 httpwwwgraphpadcom and data are expressed as means  standard error of the mean one-way analysis of variance followed by tukeys or dunnetts tests were used to compare all groups or selected groups to the control and p005 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference the quantity of insulin released from the ins-1 cells was significantly increased as expected when the glucose concentration in the incubation medium was increased from 33 to 167 mmoll fig 1 groups treated with h2o2 exhibited significantly impaired insulin secretion 518 compared with the control groups pre-treatment with 108 moll ang 1-7 prior to the addition of h2o2 can restore insulin secretion significantly although not to basal levels 261 p005 and its antagonist a779 can inhibit this restorative effect p0 05 fig 2 to determine the potential antioxidant role of ang 1-7 in pancreatic  cells ins-1 cells were used to measure the level of ros as shown in fig 3 adding 250 moll h2o2 for 15 min to the ins-1 cells clearly increased the production of ros compared with the control groups at 167 mm glucose pre-treatment with 108 moll ang 1-7 for 2 h prior to adding h2o2 reduced the level of ros p005 while treatment with 108 moll for 2 h a779 selectively inhibited this effect fig 3 gsca responses are one of the most commonly used indexes of  cell function they can provide real-time results of  cell function as shown in fig 4 gsca signaling in ins-1 cells consists of three phases phase 0 the initial dip below baseline due to calcium uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum phase 1 the rapid rise to peak calcium level concomitant with the release of pre-docked insulin granules and phase 2 the elevated plateau addition of 250 moll h2o2 for 15 min to ins-1 cells decreased the fluorescence intensity compared with the control group pre-treatment with a 108 moll ang 1-7 for 2 h prior to adding h2o2 upregulated calcium fluorescence by 25 and a779 can selectively inhibited this effect furthermore pre-incubation with ang 1-7 restored the amplitude of calcium in phase 1 and a779 blocked this effect fig 4 jc-1 was used to detect the mmp to evaluate the potential antioxidant effect of ang 1-7 on mitochondrial function in ins-1 cells analysis of fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry revealed a significant increase in mmp in ang 1-7-treated ins-1 cells fig 5a which was inhibited by treatment with a779 furthermore the red fluorescence which indicates greater mmp increased significantly following the addition of ang 1-7 which was blocked by a779 treatment as demonstrated by a significant increase in green fluorescence fig 5b as shown in fig 5 ins-1 cells treated with 250 moll h2o2 for 15 min exhibited a decrease in the level of mmp caused by cccp compared with that in the controls at 167 mm glucose pre-treatment with a 108 moll ang 1-7 for 2 h prior to adding h2o2 increased the level of mmp significantly treatment with 108 moll a779 for 2 h inhibited this effect the present study demonstrated that ang 1-7 can partially restore insulin secretion from ins-1 cells which is reduced by oxidative stress injury and reduce the level of intracellular ros this protective effect was associated with the change in cellular calcium signaling and mitochondrial function ang 1-7 can restore early phase calcium signaling and mitochondrial membrane potential and has a protective effect on mitochondrial function however ang-1-7 protective effects could be blockaded by its specific inhibitor a779 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to confirm the antioxidant effect of ang 1-7 in ins-1  cells oxidative stress results in an increase in the production of ros and a reduction of the scavenging mechanisms it has been well-documented that ros exhibits an important role in the development of diabetes as the end products of oxidative stress a certain level of ros is required for glucose homeostasis 22 however excess ros leads to  cell dysfunction by promoting  cell apoptosis and inactivating genes involved in insulin synthesis such as v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog a and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 23 in addition hyperactivity of ras leads to the development of  cell dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress and fibrosis 34 ang 1-7 is considered to be an important antagonist of angii and it has been shown to be able to reduce oxidative stress in the kidneys cardiovascular system and neural system however the effects of ang 1-7 in pancreatic  cell remains unknown we hypothesized that the effects of ang 1-7 occur via the same mechanisms in pancreatic  cells as shown in the present study ang 1-7 reduced the intracellular ros levels in ins-1 cells and had a protective effect on  cell function bindom et al 15 found that ace2 overexpression in the pancreas of diabetic rats improves the function of  cells furthermore the protective effect can be blocked by its specific inhibitor a779 which suggested that this effect was mediated by ang 1-7 15 and is consistent with the findings of the present study in addition chronic injection of ang 1-7 improves insulin sensitivity in rats with a high-fructose diet 24 mas receptor knockout mice exhibited decreased insulin sensitivity impaired glucose tolerance and glucose uptake 25 these studies demonstrated the protective role of ang 1-7 in the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome in addition a number of studies in other systems supported the idea that the protective role of ang 1-7 occurs by reducing oxidative stress ace2 overexpression results in a reduction of ros formation in the brain 17 furthermore continuous intravenous infusion of ang 1-7 restores vasodilation and protects the myocardium via inhibition of oxidative stress 24 in pancreatic  cells the regulation of intracellular calcium is crucial to the processes of insulin secretion 26 thus analyzing gsca responses can provide information regarding the viability and function of pancreatic  cells gsca results can be obtained rapidly and at a lower cost than gsis 27 in addition the calcium curve directly reflects the changes in insulin secretion within the first 15 min following the addition of glucose in the present study it was observed that the intracellular calcium fluorescence intensity and the amplitude of insulin secretion in the first phase significantly decreased following treatment with h2o2 this result is consistent with the insulin secretion experiment which suggests that the reduction of insulin secretion is correlated with a decrease in intracellular calcium ang 1-7 can restore the calcium fluorescent intensity and the signaling peak of first phase insulin secretion moreover a779 can block this effect this study confirmed that oxidative stress can cause a decline in intracellular calcium which results in the reduction of first phase insulin secretion in pancreatic cells and ang-1-7 can restore this early  cell dysfunction associated with calcium levels our previous study showed that ace2 knockout mice exhibited progressive impairments in glucose tolerance and reduced first-phase insulin secretion 14 thus in vivo and in vitro experiments were consistent these results demonstrated the importance of the ace2-ang 1-7-mas axis in the early stages of diabetes and its protective role in the early treatment of diabetes as well as the correlation with ang 1-7 and oxidative stress in ins-1 cells islet  cells detect changes in blood glucose and maintain glucose homeostasis the mitochondrial energy metabolism conditions in pancreatic  cells are crucial for the capacity of sensing blood glucose levels 28 the importance of mitochondria in type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated by the identification of causal mutations in the mitochondrial dna in pancreatic  cells 2930 excessive angii can increase mitochondrial ros production and reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory control ratio 21 recent studies have shown that at1r blockers can protect the mitochondria in the kidney in a type 1 diabetes mouse model in the present study ang 1-7 restored the impaired mmp and exhibited protective effects on mitochondrial function the protective effect on mitochondrial function is likely to be one of the mechanisms underlying the antioxidant effect of ang 1-7 in pancreatic  cells in conclusion to the best of our knowledge the present study was the first to demonstrate the antioxidant effect of ang 1-7 in the ins-1 pancreatic cell line and the restorative effects of ang 1-7 on insulin secretion this was associated with restoration of calcium signaling reduction of ros generation and restoration of the impaired mitochondrial function in oxidative stress conditions the effects observed following treatment with ang 1-7 were inhibited by its specific antagonist a779 this study demonstrated that reducing ros production and restoring mitochondrial function are likely to be the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of ang 1-7 on pancreatic  cell function under oxidative stress notably this experiment confirms the importance of ang 1-7 in the early stages of diabetes these findings may assist with the treatment of diabetes in future potentially during the development of novel therapeutic strategies  journal pre-proof considerations for heart failure care during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic ersilia defilippis m nosheen reza elena donald michael givertz m joann lindenfeld mariell jessup  the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected the care of patients with hf who contract covid-19 as well as those without covid-19 who have been impacted by the restructuring of health care delivery patients with hf and other cardiovascular comorbidities are at risk for severe disease and complications of infection similarly covid-19 has been demonstrated to cause myocarditis and may be implicated in new-onset cardiomyopathy during this pandemic special considerations are needed for patients with advanced hf including those supported by durable left

the earliest cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 were reported 1 our care delivery systems have been reorganized and challenged in unprecedented ways patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions including heart failure hf are at risk for severe infection and complications 2 3  special considerations are needed for patients with advanced hf including those supported by durable left ventricular assist devices lvads and heart transplant ht recipients this review aims to summarize emerging data regarding the development of hf secondary to covid-19 covid-19 infection in patients with advanced hf and the implications of the pandemic on care delivery for non-infected patients with hf covid-19 may cause or worsen hf through a variety of mechanisms including myocardial ischemia or infarction increased oxygen demand elevations in pulmonary pressures pulmonary embolism myocarditis stress cardiomyopathy and diffuse cytokine release 4 figure 1  these may concurrently lead to arrhythmias cardiogenic shock and sudden cardiac death 2 5  patients with covid-19 are at higher risk for thrombosis in the arterial and venous circulations due to endothelial dysfunction inflammation oxidative stress and platelet activation 6  acute coronary syndromes with plaque rupture leading to type i myocardial infarction may occur in this setting 6  hypoxemic respiratory failure and increased myocardial oxygen demand may lead to oxygen supply-demand mismatch and precipitate type 2 myocardial infarction 4  both may trigger decompensation of pre-existing hf or development of de novo acute hf right ventricular failure can also develop secondary to elevated pulmonary pressures in the setting of ards andor pulmonary embolism 7  covid-19-associated myocarditis has been demonstrated by visualization of covid-19 viral particles on endomyocardial biopsy and detection of diffuse myocardial edema on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging mri 8 9  attempted myocarditis treatment strategies have included lopinavirritonavir hydroxychloroquine systemic glucocorticoid therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin 9 10  some data suggest that cardiomyopathy may not be uncommon in patients with covid-19 in a us report of 21 patients with severe covid-19 disease 7 33 developed cardiomyopathy which was defined as newly decreased left ventricular systolic function with one of the following 1 increased cardiac biomarkers 2 decreased central venous oxygen saturation or 3 clinical signs of shock 11  in another cohort of patients with covid-19 from china hf developed in 4183 49 of those who died compared to 394 3 of those who recovered 12  among those who developed hf approximately 50 did not have a pre-existing history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease the underlying mechanisms for these cardiomyopathies are difficult to elucidate given inpatient diagnostic testing limitations for example the true prevalence of myocarditis secondary to covid-19 may be hard to determine without the use of definitive endomyocardial biopsies and routine cardiac imaging in a wide cohort of infected patients accordingly the diagnosis of myocarditis is often made using elevations in biomarkers echocardiography demonstrating reduction in systolic function andor worsening hemodynamics or arrhythmias large registries like the american heart association aha covid-19 cvd registry 13 will help capture the prevalence of systolic dysfunction and incidence of myocardial recovery ongoing studies will also explore the pathology of myocarditis and hf more broadly in sars-cov-2 infection 14  patients with covid-19 can develop a cytokine release syndrome with hyperinflammation leading to progressive shock and multiorgan failure in patients with cardiac involvement important questions remain regarding the use and efficacy of mechanical circulatory support device insertion and maintenance require significant equipment blood products and personnel health systems may have limited resources to deploy these therapies particularly in older patients with other co-morbidities the extracorporeal life support organization has released guidance regarding the use of ecmo for patients with covid-19 who develop severe cardiopulmonary failure 15  they suggest that in resource-limited settings younger patients without comorbidities andor health care workers should be the highest priority for support ecmo should rarely be used in older patients with significant comorbidities and multiorgan failure 15  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs and angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors arni are principal components of guideline-directed medial therapy for patients with chronic systolic hf the sars-cov-2 virus the causative viral agent for covid-19 uses the ace2 receptor for cell entry figure 2  and concerns have been raised regarding this interaction with respect to disease virulence 16  large retrospective studies have since suggested that aceiarb use are not associated with increased rates of covid-19 infection or risk of severe disease 17 18  a joint statement from the heart failure society of america hfsa american college of cardiology acc and aha recommends continuation of raas antagonists in patients who are prescribed these medications for hf or other cardiovascular indications 19  raas inhibition may have potential therapeutic benefit data from the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic demonstrated that injection of sars-cov-1 into mice worsened acute lung failure which was attenuated by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system raas blockade 20  in pre-clinical studies sacubitril-valsartan has been shown to reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines increase lymphocyte counts 21  and inhibit expression of proinflammatory genes including interleukin-6 a potential therapeutic target in covid-19 22  patients with hf have pre-existing risk factors for venous thromboembolism including possible stasis of blood in the legs heart and endothelial injury 23 24  similarly patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation are at risk for arterial thrombosis 23  in women with hf additional thrombotic risks include oral contraceptive use hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer 25  in patients with durable lvad support who are already at increased risk for thrombosis the effects of covid-19 infection on the risk for stroke or pump thrombosis are currently unknown patients with hf on anticoagulation who require admission for covid-19 should be continued on such agents unless a strong contraindication exists all hospitalized hf patients with covid-19 without a pre-existing indication should receive prophylactic doses of anticoagulation 26  this and other therapeutic considerations are described in the central illustration underlying pulmonary disease is common in patients with hf approximately 30 of such patients have chronic obstructive lung disease which independently increases their risk for hospitalization and mortality 27  these patients may have pulmonary hypertension as a consequence of parenchymal lung disease in addition to elevated left ventricular filling pressures 28  in patients with covid-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure and ards can exacerbate pulmonary vasoconstriction and interstitial edema worsening pulmonary hypertension even in patients without pre-existing lung disease 29  in patients with pre-existing biventricular failure further elevation in pulmonary pressures secondary to ards can worsen right ventricular function patients with advanced hf including those on durable lvad support have severely reduced functional capacity 30 31  as measured by peak vo2 and impaired ability to augment cardiac output in response to physiologic stressors these factors collectively decrease their cardiopulmonary reserve despite preliminary reports suggesting that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may improve both agents have been associated with qt interval prolongation increasing the risk for arrhythmias including torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death 34 35  patients with hf often have structural and electrical abnormalities leading to delayed ventricular repolarization and qt prolongation on the surface electrocardiogram ecg 36  prolonged qtc intervals are independent predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with hf 37  many patients with hf may be prescribed qt-prolonging drugs as well as loop diuretics that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities and increase the risk of serious arrhythmias 38  additional risk factors for qt interval prolongation in hospitalized patients include female sex older age sepsis and a baseline qtc 450 milliseconds on admission 39  systemic inflammation underlies both acute and chronic hf 40  the hemodynamic stress of hf stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 beta 40  furthermore co-existing co-morbidities such as obesity type 2 diabetes and hypertension may perpetuate a persistent inflammatory state leading to multiorgan involvement and endothelial dysfunction 40  inflammatory markers used to determine covid-19 severity such as c-reactive protein lactate dehydrogenase nt-probnp and interleukin-6 may already be elevated in hf including patients on lvad support 40 41 42  therefore values obtained in the setting of covid-19 should be compared to prior values if available despite efforts to maintain social distancing community spread of covid-19 is increasing patients with hf who self-quarantine may still be at risk for acquiring covid-19 as they commonly have external nursing support advanced care planning is critical for all hf patients including populations on lvad support and ht recipients particularly for patients in areas with high covid-19 prevalence ideally clinicians should initiate these conversations with patients and their caregivers at the onset of their hf diagnosis and not at the time of emergent hospitalization for patients with hf who develop covid-19 and require hospital admission care teams should involve their hf specialists in conversations regarding goals of care including the deactivation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators icds 43  patients should be encouraged to have these discussions with their families even after admission utilizing videoconferencing technology as institutional visitor restrictions frequently limit the bedside presence of family members patients on lvad support who contract covid-19 are at risk for severe viral infection due to older age comorbidities and immunosuppressed state they suffer from compromised cellular immunity evidenced by aberrant t-cell activation heightened susceptibility of cd4 t cells to spontaneous apoptosis and cytokine imbalances 44  this functionally immunosuppressed state increases susceptibility to complications from opportunistic infections 45  cases of covid-19 have been reported in patients on destination therapy lvad support who developed ards and multiorgan failure with evidence of cytokine release syndrome 46 47  both cases highlighted the challenges of prone positioning in lvad patients given concerns regarding increased right ventricular pressures and right ventricular failure while international society for heart and lung transplantation ishlt guidance suggests that lvad patients can be proned for the management of hypoxemic respiratory failure 48  more data are needed respiratory viruses have been shown to cause rapid progression to pneumonia greater disease severity and prolonged viral shedding in solid organ transplant recipients 49  post-transplant patients are more likely to develop bacterial or fungal superinfection due to their immunocompromised state 49  although the anti-inflammatory effects of immunosuppressants may mitigate disease severity through reduction in cytokine production 50 51  past experience with sars and mers showed that clinical presentations of transplant patients were similar to the general population 2  notably mtor inhibitors have been associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections 52 53  cases of covid-19 have been reported in ht recipients 54-56  table 1  given their immunosuppressed states presentations may be atypical and high suspicion for covid-19 illness should be maintained in the largest report of 28 ht recipients with covid-19 79 were hospitalized and 25 required mechanical ventilation 56  mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued in 70 and calcineurin inhibitors were reduced in 26 of patients seven patients 25 died for ht patients with covid-19 illness transplant teams should consider dose reducing calcineurin inhibitors and reducing or holding antimetabolites drug interactions between immunosuppressants and covid-19 therapeutics should be reviewed 57  leukopenia is common in patients with covid-19 although it is typically manifest by lymphopenia rather than neutropenia 58  this should be considered in newly transplanted patients on valganciclovir and mycophenolate which can have similar myelosuppressive effects in patients who develop allograft dysfunction distinguishing rejection from viral myocardial involvement may be difficult as availability of endomyocardial biopsies may be restricted 57  the reorganization of healthcare structures spurred by the covid-19 pandemic has significantly affected patients with hf figure 3  to reduce sars-cov-2 transmission and maintain a healthy workforce health systems have largely transitioned to non-contact care delivery methods for ambulatory care in response to these challenges the centers for medicare and medicaid response supplemental appropriations act in early march 2020 under the 1135 waiver medicare will pay for telehealth services provided in inpatient outpatient and home settings by a range of providers types of covered services include telehealth visits during which an audiovisual telecommunication system is used virtual check-ins which are brief check-ins between patient and provider via telephone or another device to decide whether additional services are needed and e-visits which are communications between patients and providers through an online portal 59  commercial payers are also reimbursing for telehealth however policies surrounding rates and payments are evolving penalties against providers for violations of the health insurance portability and accountability act are also being waived allowing the use of more commonly available telecommunications platforms the feasibility and safety of telemedicine for patients with hf is well established however its use has not yet been reliably associated with reduction in emergency department visits or therapeutic inertia in hf care is an ongoing risk during this period close monitoring of electrolyte and renal function is critical to safe dose adjustment of guideline directed therapies for hf with reduced ejection fraction and diuretics 61  however the reduction in available laboratory services during the pandemic and patients hesitancy to risk covid-19 exposure may limit up-titration of raas antagonists in addition to providing standard hf care clinicians should regularly inquire regarding dietary and lifestyle habits related to covid-19 due to physical and social isolation and other stresses changes in nutritional status food availability alcohol intake physical activity and social support may occur and contribute to worsening hf this reliance on remote care has the potential to exacerbate preexisting health inequities 62  disadvantaged populations some underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and those with limited access to the internet andor smart devices may not derive benefit from the expansion of these innovations older adults who comprise a significant portion of the us population with hf may have educational visual auditory and cognitive impairments that hinder their participation in remote care programs should incorporate social workers and case managers to maximize outreach to these at-risk populations the option for in-person clinic visits should remain available for patients without access to telemedicine services high-risk patients eg patients on continuous inotropes or those for whom physical examination is critical for clinical decision-making aggressive risk reduction practices should be in place during these visits programs may benefit from establishing triage principles for outpatient virtual versus in-person visits virtual visits may be best utilized for medication titration and optimization for stable patients with accaha stage c hf ht recipients on stable immunosuppression at low risk for allograft rejection and hemodynamically optimized lvad patients may be managed remotely in-person visits should be considered for recently hospitalized patients patients approaching stage d hf on continuous inotropes undergoing evaluation for advanced hf therapies who are newly post-lvad implantationht and those with new-onset hf virtual and in-person ambulatory schedules should be constructed to accommodate both routine and urgent visits given uncertainty surrounding the future course of covid-19 telemedicine is likely to endure as an important component of advanced hf disease management monitoring the safety and efficacy of remote care for hf and establishing evidence-based best practices for virtual visits should become a priority for hf programs additional information regarding existing platforms workflows and care models for telemedicine in hf is provided in a recently published statement from the hfsa 60 under cdc guidance risk mitigation strategies have included the postponement and cancellation of elective diagnostic and therapeutic procedures 6 63  for stable patients with advanced hf these procedures include echocardiograms stress testing cardiopulmonary exercise testing right heart catheterizations coronary angiography and implantation or interrogation of cardiac electronic devices among others individualized risk assessment is needed when classifying cases as elective the rationale for delaying procedures should be reviewed with patients and documented in the medical record 64  although delay of these procedures may not immediately affect clinical outcomes there are important long-term and indirect implications for patients with hf 62  patients undergoing lvadht evaluation may experience delays in listing andor surgery leading to worsening nutritional functional or hemodynamic status completion of the evaluation process can highlight opportunities for optimization of pulmonary vascular resistance renal function weight and adherence centers are encouraged to consider local covid-19 disease prevalence and resource availability when deliberating the timing of lvad implantation limiting implantation to patients in intermacs interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support profiles 1-3 is a reasonable approach at this time 48  for ht patients  3 months post-transplant programs may defer routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsies in those with stable allograft function with low risk of rejection for those in the more immediate post-transplant period or at higher rejection risk the decision to perform surveillance biopsies should be weighed against the risk of covid-19 exposure to patient and staff 48  the covid-19 pandemic has had far-reaching implications for donor selection organ procurement organizations wait-list candidates and transplant programs 57  given the limitations of current testing and risks for asymptomatic transmission and infection the ht community must be careful to select uninfected donors globally opos in canada italy spain and others have performed universal screening for all deceased donors 65  recognizing the false negative rates of these tests in some cases chest computed tomography may be performed as part of donor assessment to evaluate for radiographic evidence of covid-19 48  only negative covid-19 donors should be considered according to ishlt guidance decisions regarding transplantation should be made at the transplanting center based on covid-19 community prevalence and potential risks and benefits to the patient 48  in institutions with a high burden of covid-19 transplants are being reserved for patients in highest urgency statuses whose waitlist mortality risk supersedes the risk of nosocomial infection 57  beginning the week of march 15 transplant programs were able to inactivate waitlisted patients as a covid-19 precaution 66  weekly national and regional data is available from the united network for organ sharing 66  evaluation of changes in transplant volumes and outcomes over time will be necessary to understand the implications of the covid-19 pandemic on ht candidates and recipients there remains much to learn about the pathophysiology of covid-19 in patients with hf concurrently we need robust health services research focused on elucidating the impacts of telemedicine elective care deferral and risk aversion behaviors being practiced by patients and providers during the pandemic these research questions and others are described in table 2  the economic upheaval caused by the covid-19 pandemic has wide-ranging health consequences especially for those who already suffer from socioeconomic deprivation the national burdens of incident prevalent and undertreated hf will likely grow as a result of new covid-19-related heart disease delays in the recognition and treatment of ischemic heart disease rising unemployment and loss of income and health benefits for large segments of the population 62 in spite of this devastation the covid-19 pandemic has given the hf community opportunities to explore alternative care delivery models optimize ancillary support structures and expand the infrastructure for home nursing palliative care and hospice services the covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our patients with advanced hf including the lvadht population and our care delivery systems over the coming months anticipated and unforeseen challenges will arise as we manage the ramifications of this pandemic for our patients and the hf community potential contributing factors and mechanisms of worsening heart failure in patients with covid-19 include increased oxygen demand myocarditis stress cardiomyopathy ischemia or infarction cytokine release syndrome elevated pulmonary pressures and venous thromboembolism the spike proteins of the sars-cov-2 virus bind to the ace2 receptor leading to viral entry replication and sars-cov-2 infection adam17 facilitates shedding of ace2 from the membrane leading to the

epidemics through an entropy-based thermodynamic model w wang b z wu n z cao m r hu f  a model based on a thermodynamic approach is proposed for predicting the dynamics of communicable epidemics in a city when the epidemic is governed by controlling efforts of multiple scales so that an entropy is associated with the system all the epidemic details are factored into a single parameter that is determined by maximizing the rate of entropy production despite the simplicity of the final model it predicts the number of hospitalized cases with a reasonable accuracy using the data of sars of the year 2003 once the inflexion point characterizing the effect of multiple controlling efforts is known this model is supposed to be of potential usefulness since epidemics such as avian influenza like h7h9 in china this year have the risk to become communicable among human beings  starting from november 2002 till the end of may 2003 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars had spread widely over the world up to the end of may 2003 probable cases have been reported in 35 countries or regions and the cumulative number of cases has reached 8202 by may 26 2003 according to the report by the world health organization who sars in the year 2003 and avian influenza like h7n9 this year received or receive intensive attentions from all over the world due to its high case-fatality rate people were particularly interested in finding the period of the time between infection and the onset of infectiousness length of period that patients remain infectious further infections that each patient produce total number of infections during the epidemic etc a large number of publications have been reported for sars many of which have been included in reference books 1 2 and reviews 3 4  important achievements have been made for the transmission dynamics using various mathematical models 5 - 17 and reported data from hong kong or canada donnelly et al 5  riley et al 6 and lipsitch et al 7 make use of the available data for sars on latent incubation and infectious periods and have successfully fitted their models to data describing the number of cases observed over time the important conclusion is that if the sars is uncontrolled then a majority of people would be infected the potential effectiveness of different control measures has been studied in these references though sars did not appear again since 2003 there may be other epidemic such as h7n9 avian influenza occurring actually in china possibly spreading in a similar way hence the study of various models for the prediction of sars and other epidemic once it occurs is always important as assessed by dye and gay 8  the current mathematical models are complex the data are poor and some big questions such as accuracy of case reports and heterogeneity in transmission remain dye and gay anticipated that the next generation of sars models would have to become more complex it is now evident that sars and maybe avian influenza in a city can be controlled through multiscale measures such as medical interventions public-service announcements isolation of people having contact with infected restriction of individual and social activities etc when the interventions to control a communicable epidemic are intensive and of multiple scales it would be very diff  icult to find all those details of the epidemic needed by a more complex model it is thus desired that under intensive and multiscale interventions the global behavior of sars or avian influenza spread governed by a complex and multiscale system could be roughly predicted without knowing the epidemic details the dynamics of an epidemics is an important topic in biology medicine mathematics and physics and is usually modelled through differential equations 18 - 22  among which is the famous sir susceptible-infected-removed model the study on this topic is still very active  9 - 17  23 - 26  most of the models for epidemics spread rely on differential equations for the susceptible infected and removed numbers different spread mechanisms are embedded into the various terms in the differential equations in this paper we are interested in the number of hospitalized cases cumulative number of cases minus the number of deaths and the number recovered and attempt to consider a new approach to predict this number in our approach all the mechanisms controlling the spread are factored into a single parameter assuming the system controlling the spread of sars or similar epidemic is a thermodynamic one we define an entropy and determine the only parameter by using the principle of extreme rate of entropy production this allows us to relate the dynamics of the spread to the information at the inflexion point of the curve describing the time variation of the number of hospitalized cases the inflexion point is the date at which the multiple controlling measures take effect the model presented in this paper is based on a simple differential equation with the spread rate forced to satisfy four constraints section 21 the model is closed by the use of maximum or minimal rate of entropy production as the system for spread is assumed to be a thermodynamical one section 22 there is a critical point date at which the spread rate turns to decrease due to the overall role of interventions the maximum number of infected individuals and the time at which this maximum occurs can be related to the number and time corresponding to the critical date section 23 this model is validated against the sars data of the year 2003 section 3 for which we are able to follow the history of the spread model development let f t be the number of hospitalized cases defined as the cumulative number subtracted from the cumulative number of deaths and recovery ones since death and recovery are also parts of actions in the thermodynamical system then the rate of increase decrease is proportional to the number at the previous day with the roles of all the controlling mechanisms factored into the parameter t knowing the exact expression of t requires the knowledge of all the details of the epidemic and the coupling with other differential equations the essential idea in our method to find t is to ignore any details but to use a thermodynamic approach it is to be remarked that this parameter must be subjected to the following four constraints 2 at the initial stage there is an exponential increase for regular spread to start since at the initial stage the number is near zero ie 0   3 with the strong and active interventions the rate must decrease at a given day t  l which will be called the inflexion point date mathematically this amounts to say that there must be a maximum for f t say at t  d for which we have t  0 we assume that the virus causing an epidemic is constantly active high temperature or intrinsic lifetime constraint would make the epidemic disappear suddenly but this is not considered here so that t is assumed to be an analytical function also nature would select laws as simple as possible the only analytical function that meets the four constraints and that is simple enough is found to be given by where c is a parameter inserting 22 into 21 leads to the following solution which is just the log-normal function here k is a proportion constant   ln d   2  and  is to be determined in the following through the use of the principle of extreme rate of entropy production the principle of extreme rate of entropy production can be found in 27  this has been successfully used to obtain the distribution of droplet production during its impingement on solid walls 21  certainly the width of the curve f t  t can be characterized by  the wider the curve is the larger is the shannon entropy the intrinsic spread mechanism of virus and the large mixing activity of the population tend to make the curve wider so  larger however the medical and social interventions to control the epidemic constitute a dissipation mechanism which would prohibit the curve to become infinitely wide  infinitely large the width would cease to increase when the maximum dissipation rate is reached maximum dissipation rate corresponds to extreme rate of entropy production which again corresponds to here s is the shannon entropy def  ined as  0 yields the following relationship between d and l with  given by 25 we have once we know the inflexion date it is crucial to determine when is the initial date for regular spreading of the epidemic in other words we must know the number l cumulated days to reach the inflexion point counting from the initial date this can be done by using the rate of 3 application and validation of the model the model is used as follows step 1 data recording using the reported data we determine the number f at the inflexion date the date that df t dt tends to decrease also determine df t dt tl by using the reported date determine the proportion constant k in 2 3 by setting f l  f l then use 27 to determine l step 2 prediction once l and f l are known use 26 to predict d and f d and plot the curve f t  t using eq 23 to predict the number f t for l  t hence it is essential to determine the inflexion point specifically this is done as follows we record the reported number f t for each day and draw the curve gt  gt  gt  1 once we observe that gt reaches a peak denoted as g at t  l then l is considered as the inflexion point however special cautions must be made a in the early period of the epidemic it is possible to have report delay of cases so that a false peak would occur b for a city or region where the cumulative number of cases remains always small it is diff  icult to observe a clear peak in this case this approach does not apply c there is also a possibility to have multiple inflexion points due to new outbreaks as is in the case of hong kong singapore and canada numerically l is calculated as where f  2f  g2 is the number of f averaged over two consecutive dates at and before the inflexion date still using the log-normal function we can relate the maximum h  f d and the date d to f and g by h  212f and d  l  2f g where none of the constants depends on the details of the epidemic  first consider beijing using the reported date as shown in fig 1 we identify april 27 to be the critical date since df t dt experiences an evident decrease after that date we also observe a decrease before april 25 but that decrease is due to the report delay using the reported date the predicted curve f  f t follows well the curve as can be seen in fig   for hong kong we observe three distinct inflexion points as can be seen in fig 3 the prediction using the information at the three inflexion points ip1 ip2 ip3 show that the predicted curve using the first inflexion point is the closest to the reported data fig 4  more details can be seen in table 1  in table 1  when there are multiple inflexion points as is in the case for hong kong singapore and canada we use the information at the first inflexion point in the case of singapore and canada there are two maximums but we give information only for the first one for hebei the number of cases is not large but the prediction still works very well fig 5  fig 6  for singapore we observe three distinct inflexion points and two maximums fig 7  the prediction using the information at the first inflexion point fits well to the most part of the first peak fig 8  for canada we observe two inflexion points fig 9  and when the information of the first inflexion point is used the prediction reproduces well the lower part of the observed curve but fails to predict the peak value fig 10  in summary when the number is small the error is large showing that the thermodynamic approach is more accurate when the system is larger  it is interesting to note that the best fit value of  using the reported data is close to the theoretical one   0408  table 2  in fitting  the date d counting from the starting date and the maximum value h are fixed to be the values given by the reported data third and fourth columns so that only  is fitted in the second column the starting date is approximately the date when the first case was introduced into the region the outbreak for the epidemic is assumed to take place within at most ten days so the best fit  is obtained by using two epidemic starting days date with the introduction of the first case and latest possible outbreak date the range of best fit  fifth column is very close to the theoretical value 0408 for beijing and is not significantly different from the theoretical value for the other cities or regions one would wonder if the use of a value  far beyond the theoretical value does not alter the curve significantly in order to see that we display in fig 11 the role of  on the correct reproduction of the curve f  f t the log-normal curves using the thermodynamical value   0408 and the best fit value   047 are all close to the reported data however when  is significantly different from the thermodynamical value then the log-normal curve has a great departure from the reported data as can be seen from the curves using   01 and   09 this shows that the shape of the curve is quite sensitive to  and the theoretical value of  is indeed a rational one we have built a closed model for which we just need some data for the early period to determine the inflexion point l the number f l and the increase rate df ldt the model is applied to predict the number for t  l and especially d and f d for the 2003 sars and is hoped to work when the system for sars or similar epidemic spread involves multiscale interventions and constitutes a thermodynamical system despite the possible uncertainty in the reported data for 0  t  l and that the model does not require epidemic details such as latent incubation and infectious periods the comparison between model prediction and reported sars data is still good enough for the cities or regions where the epidemic is severe the prediction for the case of beijing is remarkably well since the number of cases is very large this shows that when the system is large enough the thermodynamic approach is more accurate the actual model has some difficulty to exactly handle the case of multiple inflexion points the present model can be possibly used to predict epidemics other than sars once the communicable epidemics receive intensive interventions the h7n9 avian influenza is actually of great concern 28 29 and if unluckily this should spread rapidly we expect the present model would be useful for predicting its spread for avian influenza the observed severe symptom mainly includes high fever and pneumonia 28 29  it is interesting to note that according to traditional chinese meridian doctrine 30 31  giving a pressure down or performing an acupuncture on specific acupuncture points on the meridian in a correct way by experts could be helpful to relieve or cure the corresponding symptoms see table 3  table 3  the symptoms and the corresponding meridian acupuncture points reproduced from reference 31  pain is felt on the meridian acupuncture points while a pressure is given on that points if the corresponding symptom exists symptom acupuncture meridian figure  high   on epidemic modeling in real time an application to the 2009 novel a h1n1 influenza outbreak in canada ying-hen hsieh david fisman n jianhong wu   epidemics and outbreaks caused by emerging infectious diseases continue to challenge medical and public health authorities outbreak and epidemic control requires swift action but real-time identification and characterization of epidemics remains difficult 1 methods are needed to inform real-time decision making through rapid characterization of disease epidemiology prediction of short-term disease trends and evaluation of the projected impacts of different intervention measures real-time mathematical modeling and epidemiological analysis are important tools for such endeavors but the limited public availability of information on outbreak epidemiology particularly when the outbreak creates a crisis environment and on the characteristics of any novel pathogen present obstacles to the creation of reliable and credible models during a public health emergency one needs to look no further than the 2003 sars outbreak or ongoing concerns related to highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 or bioterrorism to be reminded of the need for and difficulty of real-time modeling the emergence of a novel pandemic strain of influenza a h1n1 ph1n1 in spring 2009 highlighted these difficulties early models of 2009 ph1n1 transmission were subject to substantial uncertainties regarding all aspects of this outbreak resulting in uncertainty in judging the pandemic potential of the virus and the implementation of reactive public health responses in individual countries fraser et al 2 multiple introductions of a novel virus into the community early in the outbreak could further distort disease epidemiology by creating fluctuations in incidence that are misattributed to the behavior of a single chain of transmission we sought to address three critical issues in real time disease modeling for newly emerged 2009 ph1n1 i to estimate the basic reproduction number ii to identify the main turning points in the epidemic curve that distinguish different phases or waves of disease and iii to predict the future course of events including the final size of the outbreak in the absence of intervention we make use of a simple mathematical model namely the richards model to illustrate the usefulness of near real-time modeling in extracting valuable information regarding the outbreak directly from publicly available epidemic curves we also provide caveats regarding inherent limitations to modeling with incomplete epidemiological data the accuracy of any modeling is highly dependent on the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak considered and most epidemic curves exhibit multiple turning points peaks and valleys during the early stage of an outbreak while these may be due to stochastic random variations in disease spread and changes in either surveillance methods or case definitions turning points may also represent time points where epidemics transition from exponential growth processes to processes that have declining rates of growth and thus may identify effects of disease control programs peaks of seasonal waves of infection or natural slowing of growth due to infection of a critical fraction of susceptible individuals for every epidemic there is a suitable time point after which a given phase of an outbreak can be suitably modeled and beyond which subsequent phases may be anticipated detection of such turning points and identification of different phases or waves of an outbreak is of critical importance in designing and evaluating different intervention strategies richards 3 proposed the following model to study the growth of biological populations where ct is the cumulative number of cases reported at time t in weeks ctrct1cka here the prime  denotes the rate of change with respect to time the model parameter k is the maximum case number or final outbreak size over a single phase of outbreak r is the per capita growth rate of the infected population and a is the exponent of deviation the solution of the richards model can be explicitly given in terms of model parameters as ctk1erttm1a and the parameter tm is related to the turning point ti of the epidemic or the inflection point of the cumulative case curve by the simple formula tm  ti  lnan where ln denotes the natural logarithm using the richard model we are able to directly fit empirical data from a cumulative epidemic curve to obtain estimates of epidemiological meaningful parameters including the growth rate r in such a model formulation the basic reproduction number r0 is given by the formula r0  exprt where t is the disease generation time defined as the average time interval from infection of an individual to infection of his or her contacts it has been shown mathematically 4 that given the growth rate r the equation r0  exprt provides the upper bound of the basic reproduction number regardless of the distribution of the generation interval used assuming there is little pre-existing immunity to the pathogen under consideration additional technical details regarding the richards model can be found in 5-7 unlike the better-known deterministic compartmental models used to describe disease transmission dynamics the richards model considers only the cumulative infected population size this population size is assumed to have saturation in growth as the outbreak progresses and this saturation can be caused by immunity by implementation of control measures or other factors such as environmental or social changes eg children departing from schools for summer holiday the basic premise of the richards model is that the incidence curve of a single phase of a given epidemic consists of a single peak of high incidence resulting in an s-shaped cumulative epidemic curve with a single turning point for the outbreak the turning point or inflection point defined as the time when the rate of case accumulation changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa can be easily pinpointed as the point where the rate of change transitions from positive to negative ie the moment at which the trajectory begins to decline this time point has obvious epidemiologic importance indicating either the beginning of a new epidemic phase or the peak of the current epidemic phase for epidemics with two or more phases a variation of the s-shaped richards model has been proposed 6 this multi-staged richards model distinguishes between two types of turning points the initial s curve which signifies the first turning point that ends initial exponential growth and a second type of turning point in the epidemic curve where the growth rate of the number of cumulative cases begins to increase again signifying the beginning of the next epidemic phase this variant of richards model provides a systematic method of determining whether an outbreak is single- or multi-phase in nature and can be used to distinguish true turning points from peaks and valleys resulting from random variability in case counts more details on application of the multi-staged richards model to sars can be found in 67 readers are also referred to 89 for its applications to dengue we fit both the single- and multi-phase richards models to canadian cumulative 2009 ph1n1 cumulative case data using publicly available disease onset dates obtained from the public health agency of canada phac website 1011 phac data represent a central repository for influenza case reports provided by each of canadas provinces and territories onset dates represent best local estimates and may be obtained differently in different jurisdictions for example the province of ontario which comprises approximately 13 of the population of canada and where most spring influenza activity was concentrated replaces onset dates using a hierarchical schema whereby missing onset dates may be replaced with dates of specimen collection if known or date of specimen receipt by the provincial laboratory system if both dates of onset and specimen collection are missing data were accessed at different time points during the course of the spring wave or herald wave of the epidemic in may-july of 2009 whenever a new dataset is made available online by the phac by sequentially considering successive s-shaped segments of the epidemic curve we estimate the maximum case number k and locate turning points thus generating estimates for cumulative case numbers during each phase of the outbreak the phac cumulative case data is then fitted to the cumulative case function ct in the richards model with the initial time t0  0 being the date when the first laboratory confirmed case was reported and the initial case number c0  c0  1 the case number with onset of symptoms on that day there were some differences between sequential epidemic curves in assigned case dates for example data posted by phac on may 20 indicated an initial case date of april 13 but in the june 3 data this had been changed to april 12 perhaps due to revision of the case date as a result of additional information model parameter estimates based on the explicit solution given earlier can be obtained easily and efficiently using any standard software with a least-squares approximation tool such as sas or matlab daily incidence data by onset date were posted by phac until june 26 after which date only the daily number of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases in canada was posted for the purpose of comparison we also fit the hospitalization data to the richards model in order to evaluate temporal changes in the number of severe hospitalized cases which are assumed to be approximately proportional to the total cases number the case and hospitalization data used in this work are provided online as additional file 1 we fit the model to the daily datasets acquired in real time throughout the period under study the least-squared approximation of the model parameter estimation could converge for either the single-phased or the 2-phase richards models for the sake of brevity only four of these model fits are presented in table 1 to demonstrate the difference in modeling results over time the resulting parameter estimates with 95 confidence intervals ci for turning point ti growth rate r and maximum case number k time period included in the model and time period when the data set in question were accessed is presented in table 1 note that all dates in the tables are given by monthday we also note that the cis for r0 reflect the uncertainty in t as well as in the estimates for r and does not reflect the error due to the model itself which is always difficult to measure in order to compare the 1-phase and 2-phase models we also calculate the akaike information criterion aic 12 for the first third and fourth sets of data in table 1 where there is a model fit for the 2-phase model the results given in table 2 indicates that whenever there is a model fit for the 2-phase model its aic value is always lower than that of the 1-phase model and hence compares favorably to the 1-phase model parameter estimates fluctuate in early datasets and the least-squared parameter estimations diverge within and between 1-phase and 2-phase models in a manner that seems likely to reflect artifact in particular for the earliest model fits using data from april 13 to may 15 the estimated reproductive number for the second phase is far larger than that obtained in the first phase and that obtained using a single-phase model and illustrating the pitfalls of model estimation using the limited data available early in an epidemic estimates stabilize as the outbreak progresses as can be seen with the final data sets april 11 to june 5 and april 12 to june 19 for comparison we plot the respective theoretical epidemic curves based on the richards model with the estimated parameters described in the table above in figure 1 as noted above model can be used to estimate turning points ti and basic reproductive numbers r0 if the generation time t is know we used t  191 days 95 ci 130-271 as obtained in 2 by fitting an age stratified mathematical model to the first recognized 2009 influenza a h1n1 outbreak in la gloria mexico estimates are presented in table 1 we also conducted sensitivity analyses with r0 calculated based on longer generation times t  36 29 43 for seasonal influenza in 13 see last column in table 1 excluding implausibly high estimates of r0 generated using initial outbreak data april 13 to may 15 we obtain the estimates of r0 for the 2-phase model that range between 131 and 196 inasmuch as richards model analyzes the general trends of an epidemic eg turning point reproductive number etc it can be used to fit any epidemiological time series for a given disease process as long as the rate of change in the recorded outcome is proportional to changes in the true number of cases as such for comparison we fit our model using the time series for 2009 ph1n1 hospitalizations in canada posted by phac on july 15 11 that last date these data were made available table 3 this time series was easily fit to a one-phase model figure 2 further examples of using hospitalization or mortality data to fit the richards model can be found in 14 we used the richards model which permits estimation of key epidemiological parameters based on cumulative case counts to study the initial wave of 2009 influenza a h1n1 cases in canada in most model fits april 28-29 and may 4-7 were identified as early turning points for the outbreak with a third and final turning point around june 3-5 in models based on longer time series although this modeling approach was not able to detect turning points using some earlier data sets eg those limited to the period from april 12 to may 27 in general the turning points identified were consistent across multiple models and time series perhaps the most important divergence between models occurred with the detection of an april 29 turning point in the case report time series but not in the time series based on hospitalized cases we believe this may be attributable to the small number of hospitalizations relative to cases that had occurred by that date as well as the fact that hospitalization data only became available on april 18 the turning point can correspond to the point at which disease control activities take effect such that the rate of change in epidemic growth begins to decline or can represent the point at which an epidemic begins to wane naturally for example due to seasonal shifts or due to the epidemic having exhausted the supply of susceptibles such that the reproductive number of the epidemic declines below 1 this quantity has direct policy relevance for example in the autumn 2009 ph1n1 wave in canada vaccination for ph1n1 was initiated at or after the turning point of the autumn wave due to the time taken to produce vaccine as the epidemic was in natural decline at that point the impact of vaccination has subsequently been called into question although the richards model is able to capture the temporal changes in epidemic dynamics over the course of an outbreak it does not define their biological or epidemiological basis as such determining the nature of these turning points requires knowledge of events on the ground for correlation we suspect that the last identified turning point in early june occurred in relation to intensifying requests by the ontario public health laboratory that clinicians stop routine virological testing of all individuals with respiratory illness as well as the dismissal of schools in june with respect to the lag between final turning points using a 2-phase model for case data june 4 table 1 last line and a 1-phase model using hospitalization data june 11 this lag in turning points would actually be expected due to the time from initial onset of symptoms until hospitalization which was reported to have an interquartile range of 2-7 days in a recent study from canada 15 timelines for the 2-phase model for case data of 412-619 and the 1-phase model for hospitalization data are presented graphically in figure 3 in addition to identifying turning points the richards model is useful for estimation of the basic reproductive number r0 for an epidemic process and our estimates derived using a richards model were consistent with estimates derived using other methods for example our r0 agrees almost perfectly with that of tuite et al derived using a markov chain monte carlo simulation parameterized with individual-level data from ontarios public health surveillance system 16 our estimates of r0 is smaller than that derived by fraser et al 2 using mexican data but such differences could relate in part to the different age distributions of these two countries 17 and may also reflect the fact that our estimate is obtained canadian data at a national level while empirical mexican estimates were based on data from the town of la gloria with only 1575 residents most epidemic curves in the early stage of a novel disease outbreak have multiple phases or waves due to simple stochastic random variation mechanisms of disease importing initial transmission networks and individualcommunity behavior changes improvements in the performance of surveillance systems or changes in case definitions as the outbreak response evolves however changes in phase signified by the presence of turning points identified using the richards model may also pinpoint the timing of important changes in disease dynamics such as effective control of the epidemic via vaccination or other control measures depletion of disease-susceptible individuals such that the effective reproductive number for the disease decreases to  1 or the peak of a seasonal wave of infection as occurs with both seasonal and pandemic influenza one of the advantages of the richards model for real-time modeling is that it offers a simple means of fitting a model to cumulative case counts which smoothes out stochastic variations in the epidemic curve while there are numerous published methodologies in addition to the richards model that can be used to estimate r0 41819 some competing methods require more extensive and detailed data than are required to build a richards model which requires only cumulative case data from an epidemic curve as we also demonstrate here the richards model produces fairly stable and credible estimates of reproductive numbers early in the outbreak allowing these estimates to inform evolving disease control strategies for example the first estimates in table 1 derived using early case data accessed on may 20 closely approximate our final estimates table 1 last row thus while early estimation with the richards model failed to correctly detect turning points or accurately estimate the final outbreak size it was nonetheless useful for rapid estimation of r0 within a month of first case occurrence in canada as with any mathematical modeling technique the approach presented here is subject to limitations which include data quality associated with real-time modeling as data are often subject to ongoing cleaning correction and reclassification of onset dates as further data become available reporting delays and problems related to missing data which may be non-random in our current study the hierarchical approach used by canadas most populous province ontario for replacement of missing data could have had distorting effects on measured disease epidemiology the replacement of missing onset dates with dates of specimen collection could have resulted in the artifactual appearance of early turning points identified by our model due to limitations in weekend staffing early in the outbreak if as we believe to be the case public health laboratories did not have sufficient emergency staffing to keep up with testing on weekends such that weekend specimen log-ins declined sharply this would have created the appearance of epidemic fade out on weekends other factors that might distort the apparent epidemiology of disease include changes in guidelines for laboratory testing of suspected cases improved surveillance and public health alerts at later stages of the outbreak leading to increased case ascertainment or over-reporting of cases 20 however the quality of the time series will tend to improve with the duration of the epidemic both because stochastic variation is smoothed out and also because small variations become less important as the cumulative series becomes longer we note that a further application of the richards model in the context of influenza would relate to comparison of the epidemiology of the 2009 influenza a h1n1 epidemic to past canadian epidemics though such an endeavor is beyond the scope of the present study in summary we believe that the richards model provides an important tool for rapid epidemic modeling in the face of a public health crisis however predictions based on the richards model and all other mathematical models should be interpreted with caution early in an epidemic when one need to balance urgency with sound modeling at their worst hasty predictions are not only unhelpful but can mislead public health officials

carbon working and auxiliary electrodes and the reference elec-brain viruses and serotonin 429 trode formed by agagcl coated with chlorine ions present in the mobile phase the potential of the working electrode was set at 070v versus the reference electrode the mobile phase was modified from anderson and coworkers 1981 and consists of 90 001 m sodium acetate 10 mm edta and 10 mm sodium chloride adjusted to ph 425 with glacial acetic acid and 10 methanol standards were prepared in 05 mm sodium metabisulfite in 05 n pca and kept at -20c dilution of standards were made up daily the flow rate used was 1 mlmin retention times were 9 and 14 min for 5ht and shiaa respectively the amount of 5ht and 5hiaa present in tissues was calculated from the area under the curve using the lkb 2220 recording integrator of actual samples and samples plus external standards time course accumulation of 5ht and disappearance of 5hiaa were determined in min in the brain of mice injected with pargyline sigma an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase mao given in doses of 100 mg kg intraperitoneal ip tozer et al 1966 king et al 1985 whilton et al 19851  also the decrease in 5ht contents was measured 24 hr after the administration of pcpa sigma an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase given in a dose of 300 mgkg ip neckers and meek 19761  finally the accumulation of 5hiaa was determined in mice treated with probenecid palenzona an inhibitor of acid transport given in doses of 200 mgkg ip 2 hr before sacrifice neff et al 1967 neckers and meek 19761 turnover rates represent estimates of the tractions of the indole pool ie initial concentration metabolized per hr these numbers were calculated from a linear curve plotted as indole concentrations against time after pargyline injection linearity of regression and regres-  4 4 4 sion coefficients were calculated according to winer 1971  a two-tailed t test for significant differences p  005 was used to determine variations between groups 5ht5hiaa ratio was also calculated as an index of turnover rate an increase in this ratio reflects reduction of turnover rate karoum et al 19841  the turnover rate 5htio ratio was calculated as an index of the density of serotonergic innervation meek and loftstrandh 1976 neckers and meek 19761  mice inoculated with pixuna strain of veev did not develop signs of illness before day 6 postinoculation between 6 and 8 days after inoculation signs of encephalomyelitis were observed these included hypokinesia lethargy and paralysis of posterior limbs this was followed by death mortality was about 50 and occurred between 6 and 9 days after inoculation no mortality occurred in sham-inoculated mice groups of animals were designated control c infected with no signs ins and infected with signs of illness is at 4 days after inoculation the content of 5ht and 5hiaa in the raphe of infected mice did not change with respect to control group also significant variations were not observed in the 5htshiaa ratio table i  by day 7 after inoculation the concentrations of 5ht in the ins group did not change with respect to control group there was a 21  decrease in the content of 5hiaa in contrast the is group showed decreases of 21  in 5ht and 30 in 5hiaa content by day 15 21 30 and 60 after inoculation there were insignificant changes in both the shtshiaa ratio and 5ht and 5hiaa contents the concentration of 5ht and 5hiaa did not vary significantly in the cortex of infected animals when the values were compared to those of control groups however decreases of 20-30 in either 5ht or 5hiaa were observed in both ins and is groups also in this brain area the ratio was not significantly affected table i  this was expected since 5ht and 5hiaa decreased simultaneously after administration of pargyline 5ht accumulated quickly in the nervous tissue of normal mice under the described conditions 5ht saturation was observed within 30 minutes after the injection of pargyline raphe fig 1  by day 4 after inoculation linear increase of 5ht content was observed during the first 15 minutes after pargyline administration fig 1a  the 5ht concentration p  005 however in the ins group there was a linear increase of 5ht within 15 rnin after injection of pargyline this increase was significantly different p  005 from the concentration of this monoamine in the raphe area of the control group fig 1a  the slope of 5ht accumulation in this brain area and the turnover rate were smaller in the ins group compared to those of controls by day 7 postinoculation there was a significant accumulation of 5ht only in control mice 15 min after pargyline administration  fig   1b  p  005 the content of 5ht in is mice 15 min after pargyline injection was statistically significantly smaller than in controls accumulation of 5ht in ins and is animals was not statistically significant infected mice either ins or is the administration of pcpa did not change significantly the content of 5ht in raphe or in cortex probenecid was given to mice 7 days after the inoculation with the virus this treatment increased 5ht and shiaa in raphe and cortex of control and infected mice fig 4ab  the increase of 5ht and 5hiaa in ins and is groups was not statistically significant perhaps because of the greater variations observed within the infected groups the turnover rates5htio ratio in raphe and cortex are shown in table 111  no variation of this ratio is observed between raphe and cortex of control mice under our experimental conditions the only statistical significant modification observed within these groups was in the raphe of is mice in which there is a decrease of the ratio with respect to control groups table 111 histopathology brain of animals 7 days post-inoculation showed various abnormalities the raphe revealed 1 in ins mice edema moderate gliosis and mild signs of necrosis in the reticular formation around the raphe 2 in is mice there was disorganization of the tissue in the area gliosis and focal necrosis the cortex showed necrosis in some areas p  0001 the effect of viral infection of the cns on the metabolism of neurotransmitters has been documented in several reports lycke et al 1972 lima et al 1983 bonilla et al 19841 lyck and ross 1972 showed no change of 5ht levels in the brain of mice infected with herpes simplex virus however values of shiaa were 10 times greater than those of control mice based on these results the authors suggested that there was an increase in the turnover rate of 5ht in the infected mice studies done in some brain regions of animals infected with various encephalytic viruses have shown high selectivity for certain regions for instance levine and coworkers 1981 demonstrated that the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase decreases in striatum mesencephalum and hypthalamus of rats surviving an infection of the guajira strain of veev early changes in catecholamine turnover rates were demonstrated in 8 brain areas of mice infected with pixuna strain of veev lima et al 19831  however the levels of catecholamines in striatum mesencephalum hypothalamus and olfactory bulbtuberculum did not return to normal by day 18 after inoculation lima et al 19831  these areas correspond to the areas in which tyrosine hydroxylase is decreased levine et al 19811  moreover in the guajira strain significant decrease in the density of 3h-spiroperidol binding sites has been reported to occur in striatum midbrain and frontal cortex bonilla et al 19841  the observed decreases in the density of the binding sites do not suggest a generalized biochemical alteration moreover the activity of some brain enzymes such as gaba transaminase glutamate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase and nad-malate de- the administration of pcpa showed differences in 5ht turnover in the cortex of infected mice table 111  this observation supports the fact that more than one method should be used for measuring turnover of monoamines neckers and meek 19761 however probenecid treatment known to be useful in the determination of monoamine turnover in the brain tozer et al 19661 presents some difficulties as shown by neckers and meek i9761 and by the results of this study fig 4  it appears that the elimination of 5hiaa in infected mice presents a high degree of variation that does not allow comparison with controls despite the fact that an increase was observed in virus-inoculated groups fig 4  in contrast blocking m a 0 may be used to determine turnover rates the latter is a good index of neuronal activity in different groups of animals whereas other methods may be used to analyze all the steps of neurotransmitter turnover the differences obtained with pargyline in infected mice may be due to a better regulation of synthesis but not degradation or elimination of metabolities in the cortex figs 2 3 table 11  further the turnover rate5htio ratio could be used as an index of the density of serotonergic innervation meek and lofstrandh 19761  this ratio has been reported to be greater in cell bodies than terminals although there is disagreement in the magnitude of this difference neckers and meek 19761  the decrease in the function of 5ht neurons in the ins group does not seem to occur because of a decrease in the innervation table 111  the turnover rate5hto rate is smaller in the raphe of is mice and is significantly different from the control of ins groups table 111 p  0001 these results suggest a decrease in the density of 5ht innervation in raphe of is and not in ins mice this does not occur in the cortex of the same group table 111  the biological significance of the observed virusinduced changes in the turnover rate of 5ht is unknown we recognize that 5ht is an important neurotransmitter that participates in several psychological and neurological functions thus any alteration in the level or metabolism of 5ht may have a bearing on its physiological functions hydrogenase did not differ significantly between control and guajira veev-infected mice bonilla et al 19801 however the preference of various viruses such as herpes simplex for the limbic system delsedime et al 1984  damasio and vanhoese 19851  the coronavirus for basal ganglia fishman et al 19851 and certain viruses for locus coeruleus and raphe area maurizi 1985ab constitute focal lesions in which changes may be observed also strains of veev of moderate or intermedian virulence were used to reduce the damage to the nervous tissue lima et al 19831  in these studies the course of the infection may be followed easily and the results are uniform throughout the experiment especially when a defined dose of the virus is used walder and bradish 19791  the advantage of this type of subclinical infection of the cns in neurochemical studies has been documented lima et al 19831 because of the multiple regulatory mechanisms of monoamine metabolism in the cns the concentration of 5ht may not change even in neuronal disfunction and even if changes occur they may not accurately reflect neuronal activity neff and tozer 1968 king et al 19851  thus measuring 5ht turnover rate is necessary and should be estimated by various pharmacological approaches analysis of the accumulation of 5ht or the disappearance of 5hiaa after inhibition of m a 0 by pargyline has been widely reported tozer et al 1966 neckers and meek 1976 king et al 19851  the accumulation of 5ht or the decline of 5hiaa need not correspond exactly figs 1a3  this is probably the result of the existance of multiple pools of 5ht lane and aprison 19781  thus other methods such as the administration of inhibitors that do not completely block enzyme activity or administration of probenecid which effect could differ in different brain regions generate pharmacological and analytical difficulties neckers and meek 19761 in the present report we show that the content of 5ht and 5hiaa are not significantly modified by the infection of the cns however the disfunction is observed only when specific pharmacological agents are given as demonstrated by the decrease in the turnover rate of 5ht in the raphe neurons and to a smaller degree in the cortex terminals of infected mice the fact that significant variations of turnover rate are observed in ins as well as is mice suggests that signs of the illness could be dissociated from the biochemical damage of the brain produced by the virus by administering pargyline a significant decrease in the turnover rate of 5ht in raphe at 4 and 7 days after inoculation was observed fig 1  this decrease was not observed in the cortex by this method fig 1  it is well known that receptors of 5ht in cell bodies terminals are different

decay and exponential adjustment m-idea model for projections of daily covid-19 cases ben smith a   the sars-cov-2 virus causes the disease covid-19 and has caused high morbidity and mortality worldwide who 2020 wu zhao et al 2020 wu leung et al 2020 covid-19 was first reported in canada on january 25 2020 covid-19 canada open data working group 2020 this case and many subsequent cases over the following weeks were linked to international travel covid-19 canada open data working group 2020 the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020the same day that the case total reported in canada exceeded 100 government of canada 2020 it might never be known precisely when community transmission of the disease originally occurred in canada but the first documented case was reported on march 1 2020 covid-19 canada open data working group 2020 however it is likely that community transmission had occurred at some point before this date as of may 15th 2020 cumulative cases of covid-19 continue to climb in canada with variations in the trends of reported cases among provinces and territories government of canada 2020 there is a need for mathematical models to provide projections of future incidence and cumulative cases in canada to assist with decision-making during the early-to mid-stages of a novel epidemic or pandemic very little is known of the specific mechanisms of transmission of diseasethis is a global issue for covid-19 empirical models are useful tools to predict future trends of disease progression such as case counts over the near-term many empirical models are available for such projections with varying degrees of success in projecting cases in past outbreaks of infectious disease eg chowell et al 2016 xiao et al 2013 the incidence decay and exponential adjustment idea model was first published in 2013 as a simple phenomenological model to predict the progression of infectious disease outbreaks fisman hauck tuite  greer 2014 it has since been shown to perform comparably to other approaches for projecting case counts of ebola tuite  fisman 2018 and has fit well to observed case counts of middle east respiratory syndrome

on the premise of the interaction of the basic reproduction number of the disease r
0 and d the latter of which is discount factor that can represent for example interventions implemented to curb the spread of disease fisman hauck et al 2014 fisman rivers et al 2014 in part because it does not require detailed mechanistic information on disease transmission it has recently been suggested for quick and dirty forecasting in the face of an infectious disease epidemic tuite  fisman 2018 while the model has several limitations it can provide a complement to mechanistic approaches with the advantage of being easily and rapidly applied by public health officials tuite  fisman 2018 the idea model is parameterized on the basis of the serial interval of the disease in question the serial interval of an infectious disease describes the period of time between successive cases specifically it is defined as the interval between the clinical onset onset of symptoms in a primary case and the clinical onset in a secondary case fine 2003 moghadas  milwid 2016 nishiura linton  akhmetzhanov 2020b vink bootsma  wallinga 2014 biological variables determining the serial interval include the time needed for disease transmission to occur relative to the time of clinical onset in the primary case and the incubation period in the secondary case which is the period of time between infection and clinical onset fine 2003 the serial interval can be calculated as the sum of these two values fine 2003 serial intervals shorter than the median incubation period often result when transmission is possible prior to the development of symptoms in the primary case fine 2003 this is the case with infections such as human immunodeficiency virusacquired immunodeficiency syndrome hivaids and hepatitis a apha 2000 given that the idea model is one tool used for producing near-term projections of cases of covid-19 smith et al 2020 submitted the goal of this study was to explore the impact of the assumed serial interval for covid-19 on projection accuracy using a retrospective analysis this was accomplished by producing projections of cases seven days into the future at various stages of the pandemic in canada the modified idea m-idea model approach was developed from the original idea model described by fisman hauck et al 2014 fisman rivers et al 2014 to instead project incident cases on a daily basis the original idea model fisman hauck et al 2014 fisman rivers et al 2014 is dependent on the serial interval for the disease1ir01dggwhere i represents the incidence of disease in one generation of the disease defined by the serial interval r
0 is the reproduction number d is a discount factor that can represent the impact of public health measures to limit the impact of the disease spread and g represents the disease generation the original idea model classified this as t but it is referred to as g herein to avoid confusion with subsequent equations while the idea model compares predicted cases versus reported cases aggregated by serial interval g has historically been an integer value the approach was modified to provide case projections on a daily basis the generation of the disease g is defined as2gtserintwhere t represents time in days and serint represents the serial interval of the disease in days this parameterization allows for g to represent continuous rather than discrete values dependent on serint ig is calculated at each day t and returns the number of cases occurring between t - serint and t cumulative cases at time t is then determined by summing each ig calculated every corresponding serial interval from t  0 through t3ctigig1ig2ignwhere ign represents the first determination of i since the beginning of the pandemic and ig represents the most recent determination of i to date finally daily incidence was calculated as4itctct1
 in what follows we defined the m-idea model to be the collection of equations 14 the m-idea model is a re-parameterization of the idea model and uses an approach that allows for calculation of precise daily estimates for example if one assumes a serial interval of seven days for a given disease the original idea model returns estimates of incidence for each week-long period so the idea model calculates the total cases aggregated by disease generation that is total cases occurring between days 06 713 1420 etc as a result it is impossible to determine the precise number of cases predicted for a single day the modified approach allows for g to comprise intra-generational values and precise daily estimates are determined through equations 3 4 the m-idea model was used to project daily case incidence using a range of serial intervals given the lack of knowledge on the true serial interval of covid-19 at this time it is unknown precisely when the first community-acquired case of covid-19 occurred in canada it was assumed for this analysis that community transmission was occurring on or before march 11 2020 simply and subjectively because it was the day when reported cumulative cases in canada exceeded 100 a simple back-calculation from this date assuming an a priori r0 of 2 was conducted to anchor the model so that march 11 2020 corresponded to generation 6 of the disease in canada the assumed occurrence of the first case of community-acquired covid-19 in canada was therefore dependent on the serial interval used the m-idea model was implemented in microsoft excel with the add-ins risk version 80 and evolver version 80 palisade corporation new york usa to allow for monte carlo simulation using latin hypercube sampling and optimization of model parameters optimization of r
0 and d parameters was accomplished through minimizing the sum-of-square differences between predicted and observed daily incidence case counts this least-squares fitting method was performed using the past twenty days of observed data aside from the first three projection days which only used 5 10 and 15 days worth of data respectively since that was all that was available from march 11 onwards near-term projections using the m-idea model were made every five days using data from projection day pd 0 march 11 2020 through to pd 55 may 4 2020 the first projection occurred on pd 5 and considers data reported from march 11 2020 through march 15 2020 whereas the last projection is referred to as pd 55 and considered data reported from april 15 2020 through may 4 2020 case data were downloaded from wwwcanadaca on may 11 2020 on may 3 2020 the quebec government announced that new case totals reported that day included 1317 previously unreported cases from april therefore incidence on may 3 2020 was reduced by 1317 cases to account for this reporting error model parameter solutions were derived for a range of discrete integer serial interval values on each pd using the optquest optimization function in evolver such that optimization results remained stable defined as within 001 for 20000 consecutive trials the optquest engine uses methods of tabu search scatter search integer programming and neural networks in a novel algorithm to provide a comparative visual of projections produced by both the original idea model and the m-idea fitting was performed as described above except it was performed on all data reported from march 11 2020 through may 10 2020 arbitrarily assuming a five day serial interval the entire dataset was used because limiting data to only the past 20 days of reporting resulted in too few data points to fit the idea model following analysis of the deterministic serial interval values a stochastic approach was considered fitting was generally performed using the same procedure as for deterministic serial intervals however the serial interval used on each pd was allowed to range uniformly from either 14 days or 59 days given the results of the deterministic approach to derive 90 prediction intervals and minimum and maximum estimates a poisson error structure in the reported data was assumed monte carlo simulations with latin hypercube sampling were performed for 1000 iterations to consider both the impact of total uncertainty of the serial interval of covid-19 as well as the reported case data for computational practicality the parameter values were considered stable if they remained within 001 for 500 trials rather than the 20000 trials used for deterministic simulations for each pd daily incident cases projected for seven days in the future were compared with actual case counts reported since the date of projection eg pd 5 projections made using data up to march 15 2020 were compared with cases reported on march 16 through march 22 2020 using the root mean square error rmse5rmset1tytyt2nwhere yt is the reported value at time t yt is the model projection at time t and n is the number of observations a plot of predicted incidence produced by the original idea and m-idea models using a five day serial interval and reported incidence through may 10 2020 is provided in fig 1
 the re-parameterization of the idea model to the m-idea approach results in a smooth fit between whole number generations of the disease predicted values by the idea model are interpolated using a step-wide function to allow for clear visualization of differences between the two curves rather than linear interpolation which would obscure the curves r
0 and d values were 343 and 0043 respectively for both models both models indicated a decline in new cases of covid-19 in canada through may 2020 best fit seven-day projections for each serial interval produced each pd are plotted in fig 2

0 and d values are provided in table 1
 and model performance in fig 3
 estimated r
0 parameters tended to increase with serial interval however in most cases the control parameter d also increased with serial interval table 1 generally the serial intervals that provided the best fits were variable throughout the first two weeks of the projection period once a full 20 days of data had accumulated for fitting lower serial intervals 14 days provided better predictive capability through pd 30 however from pd 35 onward in most cases higher serial intervals 59 days were associated with better projection performance fig 3 and serial intervals ranging from 1 to 4 days considerably under-predicted future incidence in the near-term results from the stochastic approach to incorporate uncertainty in the serial interval used in the m-idea are provided in fig 4
 serial intervals were allowed to range uniformly from 1 through 4 days for pds 5 through 30 and 5 through 9 days for pds 35 through 55 because these ranges generally included the best fit discrete serial intervals in fig 3 this approach provides large prediction intervals and ranges between minimum and maximum values due to the incorporation of a range of serial intervals in most cases this approach captures the majority of future reported incidence data with some notable exceptions on pd 10 15 and 35 producing daily projections using the idea equation previously required simplifying assumptions of the inter-generational trend of cases a step-wise approach was used in fig 1 to better illustrate the differences between the idea and m-idea models but it is also possible to scale inter-generational values assuming an equivalent daily incidence within each serial interval tuite  fisman 2018 regardless the scaling of the idea model in whole number generation times has been previously recognized as a limitation that results in staggered forecasts tuite  fisman 2018 the m-idea model precludes these simplifying assumptions and produced daily incidence estimates using the idea model function this allows for prediction of daily confirmed cases which are critical during a pandemic of this scale for planning purposes the idea model operates under the premise that an epidemic follows first-order exponential growth with simultaneous second-order decay fisman hauck et al 2014 fisman rivers et al 2014 prior studies using the original idea model have determined that the model fit is impacted by the serial interval used ogden et al 2017 this is the first approach however where the impact of serial interval over time has been examined particularly in the midst of an epidemic or pandemic in this case the assumed serial interval of covid-19 had an impact on accuracy of near-term projections of reported cases using the m-idea model a range of serial intervals were examined herein to reflect possible values gleaned from the literature reported serial intervals of covid-19 range from 1 to 89 days with the majority of values between 4 and 6 days bi et al 2020 bhmer et al 2020 du wang et al 2020 du xu et al 2020 fan liu pan douglas  bao 2020 gan et al 2020 ganyani et al 2020 huang et al 2020 ji et al 2020 ki 2020 klausner fattal hirsch  shapira 2020 li chen yuan song  ma 2020 li guan et al 2020 liao et al 2020 liu liao et al 2020 liu wu et al 2020 liu li et al 2020 liu bi et al 2020 lytras panagiotakopoulos  tsiodras 2020 ma et al 2020 mizumoto  chowell 2020 nishiura linton  akhmetzhanov 2020a nishiura et al 2020b ping 2020 pung et al 2020 qian et al 2020 sun et al 2020 tindale et al 2020 wang  teunis 2020 wu zhao et al 2020 wu leung et al 2020 xu et al 2020 you et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao cao chong et al 2020 zhao cao gao et al 2020 zhao gao et al 2020 in studies specific to countries other than china the serial interval ranged from 4 to 634 days bhmer et al 2020 bui nguyen thanh  nguyen ngoc 2020 ganyani et al 2020 ki 2020 klausner et al 2020 pung et al 2020 tindale et al 2020 zhao cao gao et al 2020 the performance of the m-idea for projection cases in the near-term was improved using shorter serial intervals 14 days at early stages of the pandemic and longer serial intervals at mid to late-stages 59 days correspondingly studies examining pooled data from multiple countries reported median serial intervals ranging from 4 to 46 days between december 12 2019 and february 5 2020 and 67 days from february 20 to march 3 2020 ma et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020b however it is possible that other factors such as the exposure period of infectees and sample size could have contributed to the finding of a longer serial interval in the second time frame studied by ma et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020b this suggests that the serial interval of covid-19 might increase as the pandemic progresses which is rather intuitive and corresponds to the observations using the m-idea model increasing serial intervals can be attributed to gradual increases in public health interventions such as facility closures public caution and social distancing thus increasing the time between transmission events from january 21 through february 8 2020 longer median serial intervals of 7588 days were reported for wuhan china whereas regions of china other than wuhan reported 396 days during this period wuhans lockdown measures were comparatively stricter du wang et al 2020 lytras et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020a best-fit projections at later pds considered herein were associated with greater control parameter d values but also greater r
0 values compared to shorter serial intervals the best-fit parameters for the m-idea model were dependent on the serial interval used generally the estimated r
0 and d parameters both increased with serial interval table 1 projections made in mid-april pd 35 were associated with the highest r
0 values across the projection period when using serial intervals ranging from three to eight days on its own this could mistakenly be interpreted as an indication of increased disease transmissionwhich is contrary to expectations given that these projections were made approximately one month following implementation of public health measures across canada however in most cases d values were also greater compared to earlier pds this emphasizes that the m-idea is not a tool intended to produce r
0 values in a vacuum and r
0 must be presented and considered hand-in-hand alongside its associated d value given a lack of knowledge of the actual pandemic start date in canada march 11 2020 was chosen as an anchoring point for covid-19 community transmission in canada for the m-idea model corresponding to generation 6 of the disease there is considerable uncertainty around the start date of community transmission in canada with this approach the calculated start date varied with serial interval ie a serial interval of 1 day corresponded with start date of march 5 2020 whereas a serial interval of 9 days corresponded with a start date of jan 17 2020 as well as the assumed r
0 of the disease a r
0 of 2 was assumed a priori for this analysis the impact of the assumed start date of the pandemic can have an influence on m-idea model projections when march 11 2020 was instead anchored to lower or higher generations relative to generation 6 resulting near-term projections for pd 55 the only pd for which this was explored were also lower and higher respectively results not shown it is also likely that best fit serial intervals for each pd would vary with differing generation numbers anchored to march 11 2020 future work could explore these impacts more thoroughly implementations of the idea model for ebola were better able to predict the epidemic peak in west africa compared to producing accurate short-term projections tuite  fisman 2018 the m-idea was unable to produce accurate short-term projections at early stages for the pandemic in canada which is unsurprising given the rapidly changing landscape of public health intervention and testing strategies during these early stages as well as the lack of time-series data for fitting at early stages the best fits serial intervals appeared to stabilize somewhat from pd 25 onwards a comparison of three phenomenological models the generalized richards model logistic and stochastic m-idea models showed that none of the models provided reasonable accurate projections in early march of 2020 smith et al 2020 submitted the stochastic approach used can account for the uncertainty around the serial interval of covid-19 and is preferred for the m-idea during a dynamic situation such as in the midst of a major pandemic various distributions of serial intervals coupled with a poisson error structure in reported case data were implemented and resultant distributions of case incidence were projected this approach used inherently accounts for correlation between m-idea parameters r

0 and d across simulations and deriving prediction intervals which would result in highly unlikely to impossible combinations of parameters it was shown here that the serial interval associated with the best fit of the m-idea model changes throughout the course of the covid-19 pandemic in canada it is proposed that the serial interval used in the m-idea model be frequently updated through retrospective analysis of model performance and modified where necessary for future projections for example here it was shown that lower and higher serial intervals produced more accurate projections at earlier and later stages respectively of the covid-19 pandemic in canada low serial intervals 14 days projected considerably lower incidence than reported for future cases at the later stages of this study period although the idea model was not developed as a tool to predict the actual serial interval of a disease the use of the m-idea provides evidence that the serial interval of covid-19 at the national level in canada has increased over the course of the pandemic while the rmse was used to assess model performance it is possible that results could vary when using alternate error metrics caution is advised before adopting these same serial intervals for application of phenomenological models to other datasets at the regional eg provinces and territories or international scale a similar analysis should be conducted in other areas to determine the serial intervals that provides the best fit to date in a recurring iterative manner it has been previously proposed that the idea model could implement multiple time-specific control parameters to improve forecasting tuite  fisman 2018 until then incorporating uncertainty through a stochastic approach to parameterize the serial interval is preferred as it has been shown that the serial interval associated with the more accurate near-term projections varied throughout the study period although this is somewhat akin to trying to hit a moving target it is nevertheless preferable and more biologically plausible compared to assuming an identical discrete value serial interval throughout the pandemic i have no conflicts of interest to declare  introduction to bank bailouts bail-ins and related topics covered in the book allen berger n raluca roman a   prior to and during the global financial crisis and european sovereign debt crisis bank bailouts were the most frequent responses by governments to financial crises as well as to tbtf titf or tmtf problems box 11 box 12

source european commission as shown in box 11 there were many large programs to aid the banks in the us during and after the global financial crisis many consider the capital purchase program cpp component of tarp as the bank bailout in the us under the cpp the us treasury department injected 2049 billion of preferred equity into 709 banking organizations another 40 billion was distributed to two large banking organizations through the targeted investment program tip and 057 billion was disbursed to 84 institutions under the community development capital initiative cdci of tarp the original plan for tarp was to purchase toxic mortgage-backed securities mbs but this role later fell to federal reserve in its quantitative easing qe programs as discussed below also shown in box 11 the federal reserve greatly expanded its discount window program to provide funds with maturities beyond overnight which we refer to as the term discount window tdw program the federal reserve also created the term auction facilities taf to address the potential stigma associated with borrowing from the lender of last resort through the discount window encourage bank participation and provide additional liquidity to the banks the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic enacted the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp which guaranteed some otherwise uninsured bank creditors through the transaction account guarantee program tagp and the debt guarantee program dgp preventing possible liquidity drains from the banks the federal home loan bank fhlb system provided low-cost funding to local banks to support mortgage lending the federal reserve additionally engaged in unconventional monetary policy including massive purchases of mbs well beyond the 700 billion originally planned for tarp as well as trillions of dollars more of long-term treasuries under the qe programs qe was implemented in four phases qe1 qe2 qe3 and qe4 with pauses in between them the us treasury and federal reserve also bailed out an insurance company american international group aig using a combination of loans and capital injections although aig is not a bank we consider this as a type of bank bailout because the company owed significant amount of funds to a number of large banks and this helped avoid large losses for these banks the reader needs not agree with our characterization of all of these us government federal reserve and other agency actions as bank bailouts to gain something from this book whether the reader 1 thinks of tarp or cpp as the us bank bailout 2 agrees that all of the actions described above are bailouts or 3 lands somewhere in between there should be plenty of information to inform the reader bailouts in europe were originally initiated by individual country governments or small groups of governments as large banks in their countries were affected by the financial crises for example in august 2008 northern rock bank was bailed out by the bank of england and was later nationalized shortly thereafter fortis and later dexia both of which operated in multiple nations were bailed out by the governments of belgium luxembourg and netherlands the government of ireland announced its decision to guarantee all deposits and debts of six irish banks and all their subsidiaries abroad many other banks in other eu countries were bailed out by their own governments or nationalized
 as the financial crises became aggravated an eu-level bailout approach was considered necessary to handle the situation as shown in box 12 between 2008 and 2016 the european commission approved a total of about 50 trillion of state aid to be granted to 28 eu countries of which about 19 trillion was effectively implemented3
the total implemented measures accounted for about 131 of 2016 eu gross domestic product gdp with considerable variation across countries four different types of bailout support were used guarantees on bank liabilities 61 of the total support capital injections or recapitalizations 24 of the total support asset relief interventions 10 of the total support and bank liquidity support 5 of the total support fig 11
below in all eu states made extensive use of various forms of government support to stabilize the banking sector guarantees rather than capital injections were the most frequently used bailout instrument bailouts are often very attractive to government officials because they can usually be put together relatively quickly and do not require the advance cooperation of private-sector agents that bail-ins often do bailouts help avoid or mitigate short-term financial system problems increase stability reduce systemic risk and reduce the likelihood and severity of recessions which are often the consequences of banks financial distress and failures as discussed in later chapters bailouts are also generally found to increase credit supply and improve economic conditions by increasing employment and reducing firm and consumer bankruptcies however bailouts also come with social costs they may create long-run moral hazard incentives for banks to take on excessive risks because bailouts may raise expectations of future bailouts that may weaken market discipline bailouts may also impose costs on taxpayers that may not be adequately compensated for the risks taken bailouts of some banks and not others could create distortions in bank competition as well bailouts may additionally distort funds allocation to the extent that they may be distributed partially according to the banks political and regulatory connections thus bailouts have a multitude of effects and as discussed further below the theory does not provide a clear answer ex ante as to whether the net effect of bailouts are considered beneficial the bank bailouts during the global financial crisis and european sovereign debt crisis were largely unpopular fig 12
 the chicago booth  kellogg school financial trust index survey demonstrates some of this disapproval for us it suggests that us respondents have the least trust in bailed-out banks over the period 2009-2015 similarly a poll by gallup about confidence in banks for selected eu countries with bailouts shows that confidence in these banks has been very slow to return to pre-crisis levels4
 some major reasons behind this unpopularity are the perceived unfairness of bailing out wealthy banks and that bailouts are often quite expensive for governments and taxpayers and sometimes led to sovereign debt problems eg spain in part as a result of the general dissatisfaction with the bailouts implemented during the global financial crisis and european sovereign debt crisis governments established bail-in regimes in which private stakeholders provide much of the capital liquidity guarantees or other support box 13 box 14

 ola was established by the doddfrank act of 2010 an ola event is triggered when a very large bhc is in default or danger of default and its failure would have serious adverse financial stability consequences the fdic temporarily takes over the bhc and fires its management while the banks and other holding company subsidiaries it owns continue to operate existing shareholders are wiped out and subordinated debtholders and possibly other uninsured creditors have part of their debt claims turned into equity capital so that the bhc becomes well capitalized the bhc is then returned to private hands with new management importantly while no ola bail-in event has been triggered for any bhc as of this writing this does not mean that ola has not had an impact on bhc behavior or the stability of the financial system to the contrary we review some research below that suggests that the incentives created by the ola regime have already had significant effects in terms of encouraging banks to hold higher capital ratios and respond to distress by increasing these ratios more quickly of course more evidence will be revealed about the effectiveness of ola if and when it is triggered in the future possibly during forthcoming financial crises in the eu the brrd and the srm became effective in january 2016 the goal was to create a common framework for bank resolution across all eu member states to deal with resolving potential failure of large financial institutions the brrd is the set of rules for bail-ins while the srm is the organization that implements these rules once an institution reaches the point of nonviability and is declared as failing or likely to fail a bail-in tool allows regulators to conduct a fast recapitalization of a troubled institution prior to default by either writing-off or converting liabilities to equity and requiring creditors to take losses on holdings according to a certain hierarchy particularly brrd establishes the hierarchy such that the bail-in will affect equity holders first followed by subordinated debt holders senior unsecured debt holders and uninsured depositors this is intended to minimize the costs for taxpayers and real economy there is some experience with and research on these bail-in regimes as shown by the individual eu country bail-in examples in box 15

and discussed below bail-in regimes may have advantages over bailout regimes in terms of better safeguarding taxpayer funds and lessening unfair competitive advantages that bailouts may provide to the recipient banks they may also induce more prudent bank management behavior in terms of holding preemptively adequate capital to avoid bail-ins in addition the market participants provision of increased market discipline from bail-ins may be nimbler than supervisory authorities exerting supervisory discipline in reducing long-term moral hazard incentives for banks to allow capital to fall too low or shift into riskier portfoliosbox 16pros and cons of bailouts and bail-ins

 there are also some potential disadvantages of bail-ins these include possibly more delays and high financial costs in implementation compared to bailouts credibility problems that the governments may bail out the banks instead difficulties in handling systemic events that may include distress of many large institutions at the same time contagion and run-off by creditors potentially transferring risks to private-sector agents that do not understand these risks and transmitting financial problems to other parts of the financial system which may also be fragile at the same time as banks last but not least bail-ins may also lead to worse outcomes in credit supply and economic conditions for the connected borrowers of the bailed-in institutions compared to bailouts we refer the reader to chapter 27 for a more in-depth analysis of the benefits and costs of bailouts bail-ins and other approaches for dealing with the financial distress of important financial institutions as discussed below some theoretical research finds similar social welfare values for bailouts and bail-ins measured by the expected value of the recipient bank minus the expected external costs on society from its default however the research also shows a key advantage of bail-ins over bailouts in that bail-ins provide superior ex ante incentives for banks to rebuild capital preemptively during financial distress this advantage is confirmed by empirical analysis bail-ins may also be superior to bailouts in terms of reducing banks moral hazard incentives to shift into riskier portfolios an alternative response to financial crises andor the distress of tbtf titf or tmtf banks is what we refer to as bankruptcyfailure this is one case in which we must distinguish between banks and bhcs by bankruptcyfailure we mean that the bhc declares bankruptcy and bank or banks it owns are allowed to fail this approach may have social advantages in terms of reduced long-term moral hazard incentives and improved market discipline that is reduced expectations of government interventions may encourage banks and bhcs to hold higher capital ratios to protect themselves against this outcome and may increase debtholders incentives to monitor and react to risks to preserve the value of their claims as discussed below some theoretical research supports the notion that bankruptcyfailure would result in higher capital ratios however bankruptcyfailure may also pose very substantial short-term risks to the financial system and real economy the bankruptcy of the bhc results in its stock market value being wiped out and losses imposed on all of its creditor financial institutions which may greatly harm the financial system these creditor institutions may in turn become distressed which further weakens the financial system and may result in reduced credit to the public also harming the real economy the failure of the bank itself results in a cutoff of credit to all of its borrowers which may also have a first-order effect in damaging the real economy these dangers to the financial system and the real economy may be exacerbated by two factors first these financial and economic problems may be exacerbated during a financial crisis when many bhcs may become bankrupt and many banks may fail second the judicial system for handling the bankruptcy process may have difficulties in terms of the financial expertise and speed needed to resolve complex financial institutions particularly during a financial crisis the theoretical research discussed below suggests that at least under some assumptions bankruptcyfailure is strictly dominated by bailouts and bail-ins in terms of both social welfare and the private welfare of shareholders it is also dominated by bail-ins in terms of providing incentives for banks to recapitalize to avoid financial distress
 during the global financial crisis very few large financial institutions were allowed to fail in the us one large very interconnected investment bank lehman brothers and two large relatively unconnected thrift institutions washington mutual and indymac bank failed there is virtual consensus that the lehman brothers failure caused significant harm to both the financial system and the real economy although it is difficult to determine how much of the trillions of dollars of costs to the us economy of the crisis can be attributed to the effects of this one failure strategies such as allowing significant numbers of failures during financial crises or letting tbtf titf or tmtf banks fail have not been widely implemented in developed economies since the great depression bernanke 1983 suggests that the widespread bank failures during the great depression reduced lending which made the economy much worse friedman and schwartz 1963 find that the reduction of money supply caused by these bank failures also significantly harmed the economy nonetheless widespread implementation of bankruptcyfailure is important to address because it is a future possibility it was advocated in the financial choice act which passed the us house of representatives in 2017 although it was not enacted the act would expand the role of bankruptcy for large banking organizations and allow failures of large banks by repealing ola and establishing a new section of the us bankruptcy code chapter 14 to resolve failed complex financial institutions resolutions would be conducted under the auspices of a bankruptcy court and would not include regulatory intervention an alternative way to resolve the distress and impending failure of large complex banking organizations is to reorganize them using living wills or resolution plans that are designed ex ante by these organizations to restore financial strength and viability in the us section 165d of the doddfrank act requires banking organizations with total assets of 50 billion or more to report annually to the federal reserve and the fdic their plans for rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material distress or failure the g20 countries have also requested living wills from the top 24 global banks and six insurance companies claessens herring schoenmaker and summe 2010 for example under the living will the banks may develop scenarios under which certain less important parts can be sold or put into liquidation while the systemically important parts may then be rescued eg avgouleas goodhart and schoenmaker 2013 chapter 4 gives more details about these resolution tools provides excerpts from two actual living wills posted by large us bhcs and discusses implications of these plans for complex domestic and international organizations
 from a theoretical viewpoint living wills are much like the bankruptcyfailure option discussed above except that they are designed to be more orderly and preserve more of the financially viable parts of the organization it is also noteworthy that in the us ola bail-in resolution method and living wills are both products of the doddfrank act despite the fact that they appear to be substitute resolution approaches that may not be executed simultaneously on the same banking organization another alternative response to bank financial distress known as either regulatory forbearance or capital forbearance involves allowing banks with very low or negative capital ratios to continue operating without significant regulatory intervention or failure this approach is sometimes used to save on closure costs postpone dealing with problems until another regulator is in charge or in the hope that the problems will be reversed on their own however it may create more losses in the long run as discussed below in part iii of the book allowing significant numbers of problematic financial institutions to go unresolved was applied widely in the 1980s to savings and loans sls and to a lesser extent to banks at that time many sls suffered significant interest rate risk losses that devastated their equity capital as all of their mortgages were required to be fixed-rate while short-term interest rates rose as a result of very restrictive monetary policy they borrowed at high rates in the short-term and were locked in low rates on their loans in the long-term and as a consequence they lost most or all of their market values regulators largely let these zombie thrifts with low or negative capital stay open and congress actually expanded their investment powers in the 1980 depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act didmca and 1982 garnst germain act in some cases moral hazard incentives from the lack of capital resulted in additional credit risk and other problems the results of these problems were massive losses to taxpayers in the long run until the situation was somewhat resolved by the passage of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act firrea in 1989 chapter 2 discusses the conditions that typically result in bailouts bail-ins and other resolutions these conditions are usually financial crises andor the distress of tbtf titf or tmtf banks we also discuss some research on what tends to bring about financial crises and bank distress in particular we focus on excessive lending booms and liquidity buildups as determinants of financial crises we also review the literature on bank performance and failure to inform the reader about what brings about the distress and potential failure of tbtf titf and tmtf banks chapter 3 describes bailouts and bail-ins around the world as well as alternatives such as bankruptcyfailure living wills regulatory forbearance and breaking up large complex banking organizations according to size or activities we pay particular attention to tarp and the other bailouts during the global financial crisis and european sovereign debt crisis we also focus on ola and brrd and other bail-in programs that were implemented following these crises chapter 4 reviews the theories of bank bailouts bail-ins and other resolution approaches including bankruptcyfailure reorganization using living wills and regulatory forbearance in doing so we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different resolution approaches most of the chapter follows the theoretical pathways through which bailouts and bail-ins may or may not achieve their ultimate goals or outcomes of reducing systemic risk and improving the real economy to succeed in these ultimate goals bailouts and bail-ins must first achieve certain intermediate financial and economic outcomes by affecting the behavior of the banks markets and stakeholders these intermediate outcomes may then affect the ultimate outcomes for systemic risk and the real economy finally the interactions between systemic risk and the real economy must be taken into account thus the effects of bailouts and bail-ins on systemic risk and the real economy are traced through the direct channels that affect the intermediate financial and economic outcomes to the effects on these ultimate outcomes and their interactions the chapter also reviews further theoretical research covering bailouts bail-ins and other resolution approaches and comparisons among these methods
 chapter 5 discusses the main empirical methodologies employed in the empirical tarp studies to help with the understanding of the research the chapter describes difference-in-difference did instrumental variables iv propensity score matching psm heckman sample selection models and placebo tests chapter 6 discusses research on which banks received the tarp injections and the determinants of early exit from tarp as discussed there larger and healthier banks were more likely to receive the funds and to repay early political and regulatory influence also played important roles for some of the banks funds allocations banks that were constrained by the executive pay restrictions tended to choose to exit early chapter 7 explains the research on the effects of tarp on recipient banks valuations the research appears to suggest that tarp led to different effects on bank valuations depending on the events analyzed bank valuations generally increased around tarp program announcements but valuations around individual capital injections were mostly either insignificant or significantly negative consistent with various concerns about program or bank condition bank valuations around repayments were unanimously positive consistent with the recognition of repaying tarp banks being healthy and viable and other reasons including removal of compensation restrictions associated with the bailouts chapter 8 discusses research findings on the effects of tarp on market discipline by bank shareholders creditors other than depositors and depositors theoretically bailouts such as tarp may either decrease or increase the extent to which these market participants act against banks that are taking more risks for example tarp could signal an increase in the likelihood of future bailouts for tarp banks reducing market discipline alternatively tarp could signal bank weakness and increase market discipline the empirical research on discipline by the different groups of market stakeholders is mixed chapter 9 describes research findings on the impacts of tarp on leverage risk as discussed above the tarp capital injections were in the form of preferred equity which counts toward capital ratios based on tier 1 capital although it is found that tier 1 capital rose relative to assets for tarp banks such ratios are mechanically affected by tarp even if no further actions are taken by the tarp banks or market participants there is no mechanical effect of tarp on standard accounting-based or market-based leverage ratios which are based on common equity measured using either accounting or market data as discussed in more detail in chapter 9 leverage risk measured using either accounting or market data may either be decreased or increased by tarp preferred equity injections for example common equity may be increased because of boosted confidence in the bank which may make it easier to raise common equity or increase the market value of existing equity in contrast to the extent that tarp stigmatizes the bank the opposite effects may occur the relatively small amount of empirical research on this topic suggests that leverage risk is reduced one paper finds that the common equity to assets accounting ratio is increased implying a decrease in accounting-based leverage and one paper finds that market leverage is also decreased chapter 10 discusses research findings on the competitive effects of tarp two empirical studies using the did methodology suggest that tarp banks very significantly increased both their market shares and market power relative to non-tarp banks and are able to identify some of the channels through which this occurs a third empirical study of the competitive effects of tarp also finds competitive distortions for sound non-tarp peers that did not receive bailout funds the results of the last study suggest that the competitive distortions implied by the first two studies may be understated the did methodology of the first two studies only measures the effects of tarp on tarp banks relative to non-tarp banks and the third study suggests that some of these non-tarp banks also achieved higher market power from tarp so the competitive distortions created by the program may be very large further research to clarify this is obviously needed chapter 11 gives a summary of the research findings about the effects of the program on the credit supply of the recipient banks relative to others generally using the did framework most but not all of the studies find increased credit supply at the extensive marginmore dollars of loans and loan commitmentsfor tarp banks relative to non-tarp banks there is also evidence of improved credit supply to large firms at the intensive marginlower interest rate spreads larger amounts longer maturities less frequency of collateral and less restrictive covenants importantly as discussed in chapter 11 this evidence is not fully conclusive on whether tarp increased total bank credit supply because the did framework measures only the change in credit supply of tarp banks relative to non-tarp banks the total change in lending would include the effects of tarp on the lending by non-tarp banks which may have also been affected by the program as discussed in chapter 11 non-tarp banks may have either decreased or increased their credit supplies as results of tarp chapter 12 reviews research on the effects of tarp on the individual recipient banks portfolio risk it is documented that tarp banks seem to have increased the portfolio risk of tarp banks in at least three waysshifting into riskier assets easing the terms of issued loans and easing these terms relatively more for riskier borrowers the results in chapter 11 suggesting that lending increased also contributes to additional portfolio risk similar to the arguments above about lending this evidence on increased portfolio risk is not conclusive on the effects of tarp on the risk of the financial system the did framework measures only the change in the portfolio risk of tarp banks relative to non-tarp banks and excludes the effects of tarp on the risk of non-tarp banks it also neglects other factors that affect systemic risk including individual banks size and capital or leverage risk as well as interconnections among the banks the research on the effects of tarp on bank competition in chapter 10 and bank credit supply in chapter 11 suggests that tarp affected bank borrowers as well as discussed in chapter 13 the greater market power for tarp banks may help or hurt their credit customers depending on whether these borrowers are primarily served using transactional versus relationship lending technologies and which of different theories dominates the greater credit supply of tarp banksto the extent that it is not offset by any reduced lending of non-tarp bankswould generally benefit borrowers the additional research discussed in chapter 13 is about the measurement of the net effects two studies of the effects of tarp on the market values of tarp banks relationship corporate borrowers have opposing results but a third study finds that corporate borrowers of tarp banks increased their supplies of trade credit while non-tarp banks did not thus most of the limited evidence suggests that corporate borrowers were better off we are not aware of any direct evidence for unlisted small business borrowers but some evidence summarized in chapter 14 on the real economic effects of tarp is suggestive that small businesses may have been helped by tarp that evidence suggests that tarp increased net job creation and net hiring establishments and decreased business and personal bankruptcies given that most job creation hiring establishments and bankruptcies are related to small businesses it seems likely that small businesses were positively affected chapter 14 focuses on the research findings about the effects of tarp on the real economy the findings of research in chapter 11 that tarp likely increased credit supply and in chapter 13 that corporate borrowers were likely better off are suggestive of benefits to the real economy however these findings are not fully conclusive because they do not take the final step of showing that the lending increases or borrower benefits had beneficial effects on the real economy any increase in lending might not have resulted in increased spending such as investment hiring or purchases of homes or other consumption goods by borrowers that would boost the real economy instead the borrowed funds might have been saved or replaced other sources of funding determination of the effects on the real economy requires study of the real effects we are able to find only two such studies of real economic effects the research study alluded to above shows significant positive real economic benefits of tarp in terms of increased net job creation increased net hiring establishments and decreased business and personal bankruptcies in the states with more tarp recipients the second study examines the negative impacts of bank failures on business formation and net job creation at the local level and finds that tarp is effective in reducing these negative consequences importantly the benefits in these studies may be understated because they exclude the favorable effects of tarp of potentially saving the financial system from a bigger collapse for the complete picture we also need to know the effects of tarp on systemic risk if tarp saved the financial system even only partially then the real economic effects may be much larger than the measured state-level effects in other words tarp may have helped both tarp and non-tarp banks so the differences between them may understate the total effects on the real economy chapter 15 completes the research on the empirical effects of tarp by examining the research findings on the direct measurement of the effects of tarp on systemic risk the one research paper of which we are aware on this topic applies the did approach to the latest indicators of systemic risk contributions the study finds that tarp banks contributed significantly less to systemic risk after receiving tarp funds than non-tarp banks this seems to happen almost exclusively by increasing the common equity values of tarp banks through share price increases reducing the market leverage measure lvg as indicated above this is not a mechanical effect given that the common equity values are distinctly different from the preferred equity that was injected by the us treasury under tarp analogous to the arguments above the did framework measures only reduced contributions to systemic risk of the tarp banks relative to non-tarp banks this may understate the overall reduction in systemic risk because the non-tarp banks were almost surely made safer as well importantly reducing contributions to systemic risk undoubtedly have strong but difficult to measure positive effects on the real economy by keeping business and consumer confidence and bank credit higher than it otherwise would be historically financial crises imperil the real economy as financing for real investments and hiring are withdrawn and recessions often result thus had tarp not reduced contributions to systemic risk the global financial crisis would likely been worse and an even greater recession would likely have ensued chapter 16 focuses on bailouts other than tarp primarily those in the us and europe during and after the global financial crisis and european sovereign debt crisis as noted earlier and shown in box 11 above bailouts other than tarp in the us during the global financial crisis include other actions by the federal reserve fdic treasury and federal home loan bank fhlb system discussed above european bailouts include some country-level and several countries collective responses in the early times of the global financial crisis these include the bailouts of fortis and dexia by the benelux nations belgium the netherlands and luxembourg the bailouts of six large banks in ireland the bailout of northern rock by the uk government and among many others later on it was agreed that the economic situation was rather dire so the european commission executed a coordinated response at the eu level by authorizing national governments to provide state aid and guarantees to financial institutions in several forms ranging from guarantees on bank liabilities to capital injections and from asset relief interventions to bank liquidity support summarized in box 12 above a number of eu countries including greece portugal ireland spain and cyprus increased their government debt to significant ratios which in turn led to the sovereign crisis that would require assistance from the other eu countries ecb and the imf more details on the crises in europe are given in chapter 2 and additional information on the aid measures is covered in chapter 3
 the bailout research in nations other than us covered in chapter 16 discusses political determinants as well as effects of these bailouts on competition credit supply bank risk real economy and systemic risk while a large number of research papers are summarized in chapter 16 the empirical research regarding non-tarp bailouts in this chapter is much less comprehensive than the empirical research on tarp discussed in the 11 chapters of part ii the research on these other bailouts have a number of results in common with the tarp research including that most of the bailouts appear to have increased bank lending to have increased bank portfolio risks in response to moral hazard incentives and to have distorted bank competition in favor of the bailed-out banks some of the findings also suggest stigma effects on the recipient banks and awarding of bailouts based on political connections the findings with regard to the two ultimate goals of bailouts of improving the real economy and reducing systemic risk are considerably less favorable than the tarp research results for the non-tarp us bailouts there is little research on these issues and the systemic risk results are mixed for the european bailouts the long-run effects on the real economy and financial system may be negative according to some of the research the increased lending in some cases was socially-unproductive negative net present value zombie credits in some cases the bank bailouts burdened the national governments and led to distressed sovereign debt chapter 17 summarizes the empirical research findings on bail-ins including ola in the us and brrd in europe we also elaborate on research on contingent convertibles cocos a form of bail-in that is used in some european nations the chapter also discusses briefly other historical bail-in-like tools or episodes such as the double liability on shareholders used by the regulators prior to the great depression this caused shareholders of failing institutions to lose their initial investments and required them to come up with additional equity to compensate depositors we also briefly discuss one significant earlier episode of the us government dealing with a large distressed financial institution the case of the hedge fund long-term capital management ltcm in 1998 was a combination of a bailout and bail-in in which the federal reserve bank of new york helped arrange financing by a group of private-sector financial institutions the bail-in research is significantly underdeveloped relative to the bailout literature because most of the bail-in programs events and instruments are relatively recent yielding few observations to study nonetheless the research strongly suggests that bail-ins appear to promote market discipline by stakeholders including depositors bondholders stockholders and cds holders bail-in regimes may also provide much better incentives for banks to build capital than bailouts the research yields no strong conclusions about the efficacy of bail-ins on individual institution risk or systemic risk and the findings are quite limited on the effects of bail-ins on the real economy
 chapter 18 reviews empirical research findings on several resolution approaches other than bailouts and bail-ins these are 1 bankruptcyfailure the bhc goes bankrupt and the systemically important bank fails 2 reorganization using living wills as directed by the dodd-frank act 3 regulatory forbearance keeping the banks operating with little or no capital 4 breakups of large complex financial organizations in small institutions and 5 breakups of bank activities into specialized commercial banks and investment banks the research reviewed in chapter 18 does not provide significant support for any of these alternatives to bailouts and bail-ins the findings often suggest that bankruptcyfailure regulatory forbearance and breaking up large institutions may more often cause more harm than good bankruptcyfailure may drag down other financial institutions and exacerbate systemic risk regulatory forbearance may exacerbate moral hazard incentives for banks to take on excess risk breaking up large banks into smaller institutions can create bank inefficiencies that increase financial distress and failures in future crises separating investment banks from commercial banks may create institutions that cannot easily survive severe liquidity crises the existing findings are more favorable for living wills but the research is too thin to draw strong conclusions as discussed in chapter 19 the prudential mechanism prudential mechanism involves mitigating risks that are primarily under the banks control such as leverage risk credit risk or liquidity risk as a result banks are less likely to experience financial distress an example of a line of defense that may operate through the prudential mechanism is capital requirements which directly decrease leverage risk and may also reduce other types of risk by mitigating moral hazard incentives to take on excessive risks as discussed in chapter 20 while some theories yield opposing predictions the empirical research is strongly consistent with the prudential mechanism for capital requirements the certification mechanism assures the public about the safety of their investments in the banks this reduces banks risks from runs by depositors or other liability holders that might create liquidity problems or make it difficult for banks to raise funds the assurances of safety may also reduce the likelihood of rapid sales by shareholders or short sales by others that might reduce the market values of the banks andor make it difficult for them to raise equity capital during distress to illustrate a line of defense that may operate through the certification mechanism is stress testsa passing grade on a stress test may raise the publics perception of the safety of the bank although a failing grade may have the opposite effect the subsidy mechanism involves providing banks with subsidies that may prop up the bank increase its capital and reduce its leverage risk to make it less likely to experience financial distress one of the lines of defense that operates through the subsidy mechanism is deposit insurance which enriches the banks by allowing them to borrow at close to the risk-free rate due to the government protection chapter 20 discusses capital requirements which are employed by regulators around the world to keep banks from falling into financial distress that might otherwise result in bank bailouts bail-ins or other resolutions the chapter describes the concepts and theories behind these requirements how these requirements may or may not function through the three mechanisms for avoiding bank financial distress both international and us capital requirements are explained and the empirical evidence on the mechanisms is reviewed while the theory is equivocal about the prudential and certification mechanisms the empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that capital requirements are effective through these mechanisms the subsidy mechanism is not relevant for capital requirements the chapter also reviews the evidence on the controversial issues regarding the effects of capital requirements on bank liquidity creation and profitability suggesting mixed results for liquidity creation but mostly positive effects on profitability chapter 21 reviews liquidity requirements a first line of defense to reduce liquidity risk to avoid bank distress and reduce the likelihoods of bailouts bail-ins or other bank resolutions liquidity requirements are explained and the mechanisms through which they may operate are analyzed the chapter also describes international and country-specific liquidity requirements and summarizes the empirical evidence on the mechanisms the theory is mixed as to whether liquidity requirements work through the prudential and certification mechanisms most of the empirical evidence supports that liquidity requirements generally operate through the prudential mechanism albeit with some room for improvement there is no empirical evidence to our knowledge on the certification mechanism for liquidity requirements the subsidy mechanism is not applicable for this line of defense we also discuss in chapter 21 the issue of whether it is appropriate to have liquidity requirements that guard against large aggregate liquidity shocks when such shock may be alternatively dealt with by central banks lender of last resort lolr function research discussed in chapter 16 suggests that the expansion of the federal reserves use of lolr was highly successful in boosting bank lending during the global financial crisis chapter 22 discusses stress tests which have been employed by regulators since the global financial crisis to make large banking organizations resistant to future crises and other problematic situations they are essentially forward-looking capital requirements that mandate that these organizations hold sufficient capital so they would be able to continue to operate and lend during hypothetical future adverse scenarios like financial crises as is the case for the other chapters in part iv the theory practice and empirical research results are reviewed and analyzed analogous to capital requirements the theory is ambiguous about the prudential and certification mechanisms for stress tests but the empirical evidence suggests that stress tests are operative through both of these mechanisms the subsidy mechanism does not apply to stress tests the chapter also discusses the potential downsides of stress tests they may confer tbtf status to the stress-tested banks and appear to reduce their credit supplies to large and small businesses chapter 23 provides information and research findings for prudential regulatory activity restrictions these are limits or outright bans on what are considered risky bank activities and are imposed by regulators to reduce the incidence of financial distress and reduce the likelihood that bailouts bail-ins or other resolutions are needed the chapter describes several important prudential regulatory activity restrictions that have been imposed in the us and eu similar to the other first lines of defense that are explicitly designed to limit bank risk taking the theory is ambiguous about whether these restrictions operate through the prudential and certification mechanisms the empirical evidence is also unclear regarding these two mechanisms the subsidy mechanism is not applicable for prudential regulatory activity restrictions chapter 24 gives background information and reviews the theory as well as empirical research findings regarding prudential supervision this first line of defense aims to contain and reduce risks at both the bank and system levels referred to as microprudential and macroprudential supervision respectively prudential supervisors check if banks are in compliance with safety and soundness rules and regulations monitor banks for excessive bank risk taking and take actions against banks that do not follow the rules or regulations or are found to be excessively risky preventing if possible bailouts bail-ins or other resolutions as is the case for the other policies to designed to reduce bank risk the theory is ambiguous about whether prudential supervision makes banks safer versus riskier through the prudential and certification mechanisms however the empirical evidence is consistent with this supervision operating through these two mechanisms the subsidy mechanism is reversed for prudential supervision as supervisors impose costs on and collect funds from the banks acting more as a tax than a subsidy chapter 25 describes deposit insurance discusses the theory and practice of this first line of defense around the world and evaluates how well it operates or fails to operate through the three mechanisms to prevent andor deter financial distress and avoid resolution importantly some deposit insurance schemes are explicit or de jure some are implicit or de facto and most countries have a combination of both de facto insurance often protects depositors broadly during financial crises and also covers banks that are tbtf titf or groups of banks that are considered tmtf at other times and could be considered a form of preemptive bailout the theory and empirical research both suggest that deposit insurance makes banks safer through the certification and subsidy mechanisms the insurance deters runs by depositors and other liability holders certification mechanism and bolsters bank capital by allowing them to borrow at close to the risk-free rate because of the government protection subsidy mechanism the theory suggests that the moral hazard incentives engendered by deposit insurance make individual banks riskier rather than safer through the prudential mechanism however the continued lending and other services provided by these banks during recessions  which often coincide with financial crises  may support the real economy at these times and reduce risk at the system level the empirical literature has mixed results for the prudential mechanism for deposit insurance chapter 26 gives background information and reviews theory and empirical research findings for direct government ownership of banks this is a common practice in many nations around the world including some developed nations other than the us there are several motivations for this ownership including the safety of the financial system the chapter investigates the extent to which this first line of defense accomplishes this goal through the three mechanisms from a theoretical standpoint the direct ownership of banks operates through these mechanisms in a very similar fashion to deposit insurance the incentives generated by this ownership is predicted to make individual institutions behave relatively poorly in terms of efficiency and performance at virtually all times however their continued lending and support for the real economy during recessions  which often coincide with financial crises  may reduce systemic risk and improve financial stability at stressful times the empirical literature finds split results for the prudential mechanism that essentially follow the theoretical predictions the findings from the data suggest that direct government ownership may make the individual banks riskier but the financial system safer the empirical research also suggests that government ownership makes banks safer through the certification and subsidy mechanisms chapter 27 weighs the net social costs and benefits of bailouts bail-ins other resolution methods first lines of defense and countercyclical policies this chapter also reviews some additional research on tarp and countercyclical prudential and monetary policies that is relevant for drawing conclusions but does not neatly fit the topics of the earlier chapters any conclusions as to whether social benefits versus social costs dominate depend on the financial circumstances and the short- versus long-run orientation for evaluation the chapter therefore discusses conclusions for different financial stability conditions severe financial crises and tmtf versus other financial conditions and effects for short- versus long-term orientations table 191 displays these conclusions for all 16 of the policies for addressing the financial distress and potential failure of financial institutions analyzed in the book under these different circumstances chapter 28 offers logical implications of the research findings in the book for both bank policymakers and bank managers the suggestions reflect both short- and long-term orientations and are tailored to the stability conditions of the financial system we also tailor our suggestions for bank managers to the individual financial conditions of their banks for a number of the policies the implications of the research are quite clear during difficult financial conditions of severe financial crises and tmtf circumstances bailouts may be a better policy choice than bail-ins at least in the short run because bail-ins risk bringing down other financial institutions at precisely the wrong time however under more tranquil financial conditions bail-ins may be preferred over bailouts because of the superior incentives provided by bail-ins some of the other resolutions such as bankruptcyfailure and regulatory forbearance are not supported by the research under any circumstances other policies such as prudential supervision deposit insurance and countercyclical prudential policy are found to be generally favored while support for strict enforcement of other policies such as capital requirements and stress tests depend on financial conditions chapter 29 concludes the book by identifying the important unresearched and underresearched questions that need the most attention and suggesting how future researchers might address them the chapter gives five general suggestions for future research to help keep the financial system and real economy safe these include 1 a focus on reducing the likelihood and severity of financial crises 2 comparing multiple policy tools in the same study 3 measuring the indirect effects of policies on non-treated banks 4 comparing long-term and short-term program outcomes and 5 investigating policy tools in developing as well as developed nations the chapter also points researchers toward key unanswered questions regarding each of the policy approaches for dealing with the financial distress of the banking industry  bailouts bail-ins and other resolution approaches first lines of defense and countercyclical policies  the diagnostic value of detecting sudden smell loss among asymptomatic covid-19 patients in early stage the possible early sign of covid-19 yun kang jin jin cho hee min lee hyeong yeon kim ji chan-soon park   all over the world severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has been the most important public health issue this year recently this was re-named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who sars-cov-2 is also included in the coronavirus family along with sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 1 covid-19 was first reported in wuhan china 23 in december 2019 since then covid-19 has spread rapidly all over the world 4 and has killed more than 226000 people worldwide so far this rapid spread is suspected via not only human-to-human but also interspecies transmissions 5 the who declared a pandemic on march 11 according to the early studies the most common symptoms are known as fever cough difficulty in breathing sputum and sore throat 67 in fact however many patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms in early stages and so they do not realize being infected since covid-19 is highly contagious in early stages such lack of recognition can cause serious problems for the prevention of the spread of covid-19 therefore detection of covid-19 in early even asymptomatic stages will help us reduce transmission recently olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is often reported as a symptom 89 we need to pay more attention because the symptom might be easily overlooked in clinical field and so the diagnosis could be delayed in this review we reviewed recent findings of the viral infection-related olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions to identify a correlation between the olfactory or gustatory symptoms and corona virus and the values of olfactory dysfunction as an early sign of covid-19 even in asymptomatic patients we searched the articles using pubmed and embase the first keyword was viral infection coronavirus rhinovirus influenza covid sars or mers the second keyword was anosmia smell or olfactory the full search strategy has been reported in table table 1
 the articles that could not be obtained in the full text did not mention relationship between viral infection and olfactory function directly were not written in english and were the duplicated papers by the same author were excluded using endnote x9 software to date 23th april 2020 we could find 85 papers which mentioned viral infection and olfactory function among them 26 papers described relationship between olfactory symptoms and coronavirus infection including sars 40 papers described a relationship between olfactory symptoms and other viral infection including cytomegalovirus herpes virus influenza and others finally we could find 21 papers that directly described covid-19 and olfactory symptoms some of them also mentioned gustatory dysfunction or ageusia from these 21 papers 7 papers were clinical studies and others were commentary letters and editorial review fig 1
 the details of these 7 articles were demonstrated in table table 2
 a study reported patients who initially complained of acute onset anosmia not covid-19 infection but finally diagnosed with covid-19 infection 10 there were no restrictions for gender age and nationality the studies with inclusion criteria were checked independently by 2 reviewers reviewers apply inclusion criteria based on the title and abstracts if the title and abstract were adequate the full text was checked by the same reviewers the common symptoms in covid-19 patients were cough fever myalgia dyspnea headache and loss of appetite the most common ent symptoms were facial pain and nasal congestion 9 however it has been recently reported that 339 of 59 covid-19 patients in italy complained of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction and 11 complained of both dysfunctions 11 47 of 114 covid-19 patients in france complained anosmia 12 3165 and 3544 of 79 covid-19 patients in spain complained olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions these proportions were more prominent in covid-19 patients than influenza patients 13 according to the paper from usa reported that 68 and 71 of 59 patients had olfactory and gustatory dysfunction respectively 14 98 of 60 patients from iran were confirmed smell dysfunction by university of pennsylvania smell identification test upsit 15 and few articles said that covid-19 patients without severe symptoms complained these olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions according to the larger-scale research from europe 856 of the 417 mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients had olfactory dysfunctions and 888 gustatory dysfunctions phantosmia and parosmia were 126 and 324 respectively among the patients who did not complain of nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea the rates of anosmia and hyposmia were 662 and 135 9 from the other italian article 644 of 202 mild symptomatic covid-19 patients were reported alternations in smell or taste about 37 of them complained severe alternations 683 of covid-19 patients with smell or taste alternations reported fatigue and 346 reported nasal stuffiness 16 contrary to the above papers only 51 of 214 patients complained of hyposmia and 56 hypogeusia in china 8 considering the papers the rate of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is supposed to be different between europeusa and china or asia another issue is the onset of olfactory dysfunction which varied among many papers the onset of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in the clinical course of covid-19 might be important a multicenter study in europe showed that 856 and 88 of total patients n  417 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions respectively and 118 of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction appeared before other general symptoms 654 after the general symptoms and 228 at the same time 9 in italy 203 of covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction before other general symptoms and 135 during hospitalization 11 from the other study of italy 119 of covid-19 patients n  130 complained of smell or taste alternations prior to other symptoms and 267 after other symptoms 16 in iran 83 of 23 covid-19 patients with anosmia complained of anosmia as their primary symptom 17 in spain 355 among 31 covid-19 patients complained early and 677 showed acute onset of olfactory dysfunction 13 however according to another study from iran all of 21 covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction with or immediately after the other general symptoms 15 in case of sars-cov infection complete anosmia was usually reported 3 weeks after the first symptom 18 the other issue is the correlation of olfactory dysfunctions with otolaryngologic symptoms the olfactory dysfunction is not closely correlated with nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea but it is supposed to be related to fever 9 in china only 4 of patients with olfactory dysfunction complained of rhinorrhea 19 and only 5 nasal stuffiness 20 from the recent survey study of 2428 patients with new onset anosmia in united kingdom 17 of anosmia patients had only anosmia without any other otolaryngologic symptoms however this survey has limited value because only 80 patients had been tested for covid-19 infection only 74 of the tested patients were positive and most of the responders were young 10 from a case report olfactory dysfunction was described as isolated sudden onset anosmia because a patient with confirmed covid-19 complained of sudden onset anosmia without any other symptoms 21 according to the other study from italy 3 of covid-19 patients n  130 reported smell or taste alternations as the sole symptom 16 however there is also an article reporting that ent symptoms can be accompanied by anosmia 12 in korea korean center for disease control kcdc recently on 6 april 2020 announced in a press release that proportion of asymptomatic case was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation of covid-19 10284 confirmed as positive among 466804 tested in republic of korea until 6 april 2020 22 there is a study showing that most of gustatory dysfunction appeared as an early symptom before hospitalization 11 besides there might be close correlation between olfactory and gustatory dysfunction p0001 9 considering above around 2030 covid-19 patients may present olfactory dysfunction andor gustatory dysfunction as early or sometimes isolated symptom of covid-19 curiously many studies showed that women had olfactory dysfunction more frequently than men 9111217 though the reason is hard to be explained at this time according to a recent study toll-like receptor tlr activation with cytokine production and protein phosphorylation is related to x chromosomes this might explain different inflammatory conditions and clinical courses after infection between men and women 23 however from another study the results of upsit checked olfactory function were same between men and women 15 further investigations of gender difference are needed globally particularly in europe the olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions of covid-19 patients were reported as new symptoms however to date many papers have reported that the olfactory dysfunction has also occurred by other viral infections over 200 different viruses 24 2526 furthermore coronavirus family including sars is also related to post-viral anosmia 18 although the exact mechanism is not yet known 2 basic mechanisms have been suggested first conductive olfactory dysfunction can be induced if there are some problems on olfactory cleft mucosa such as mucosa inflammation or rhinorrhea 27 olfactory dysfunction in viral infection with rhinovirus parainfluenza epstein-barr viruses and some other coronavirus can be explained however in some cases even if the acoustic rhinometry result was normal the olfactory function did not recover 28 olfactory dysfunction of covid-19 patients is also thought to be less related to rhinorrhea or nasal congestion second if there are direct effects by virus on olfactory cleft mucosa sensorineural olfactory dysfunction can be considered 29 direct mucosal infection by virus can cause severe injury of peripheral olfactory neuron which might have fetal effects on olfactory receptors 30 also both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 might have the potential of microinvasion to the target receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is expressed on the olfactory bulb and the epithelial cell of oral mucosa 31 however the effects of virus on sensorineural olfactory dysfunction are controversial from one study it claims that sars-cov might affect neurons in the olfactory bulb of mice and spread to the cortex basal ganglia and midbrain 32 on the other hand there is another case report of the sars-cov patients presenting with anosmia showed normal on brain magnetic resonance imaging mri scan 18 there is also a case of covid-19 patient who showed the bilateral inflammatory mucosal obstruction of the olfactory cleft without other abnormalities in nasal cavity and olfactory bulb on computed tomographic scan ct and mri scan 33 as mentioned earlier there are differences in the olfactory and otolaryngologic symptoms of chinese and european patients 19 and it might be due to the diversity and mutation of ace2 phenotypes 3435 the validated tests which could quickly and accurately diagnose the olfactory dysfunction in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients are needed the short version of the questionnaire of olfactory disorders negative statements sqod-ns can be used to assess the quality of life of the covid-19 patients with anosmia or hyposmia 9 the score was significantly lower in patients with anosmia than hyposmia or normosmia besides subjective questionnaires commonly used olfactory tests are as follows upsit cross-cultural smell identification test cc-sit sensonic inc haddon heights nj tt olfactometry test daiichi yakuhin sangyo tokyo japan and other olfactory threshold tests 36 recently few cases of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction were confirmed by upsit there was no correlation between upsit result and awareness of olfactory dysfunction in covid-19 patients 15 also acoustic rhinometry rhinomanometry ct or mri could identify the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction mainly due to conductive problems and identify other causes however the usage of nasal endoscopy is not recommended in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients because it may provide other people unnecessary virus exposure 37 in general spontaneous recovery rates have been reported higher in post-viral patients than post-traumatic patients and there are no definite treatment guidelines in the post-viral patients presenting with olfactory or gustatory dysfunction including covid-19 there are 2 issues on anosmia treatment in covid-19 patients the first issue is that early anomia treatment in covid-19 patients can change clinical course of covid-19 but due to lack of information this issue is hard to be answered but early detection appears more likely to be meaningful rather than early treatment for covid-19 the second one is whether empirical oral steroid treatment for acute anosmia can do harm to covid-19 patients without any other symptom or with mild symptoms up to date several studies have shown that oral steroid treatment for anosmia by viral infection may be effective through reducing mucosal inflammation and edema 38 there is a controversy over the effectiveness of the use of empirical systemic corticosteroids because oral steroids may aggravate immunosuppressive state in the covid-19 patients with severe symptoms and there are studies showing that use of corticosteroids in mers patients may have affected the delay of rna reduction in mers coronavirus 39 moreover in cases of the covid-19 patients with severe lung complications the use of corticosteroids is not recommended by who guideline 40 in china however limited use of low dose corticosteroid during short-term can be permitted when absolutely necessary 41 according to the recently released aria eaaci statement it is recommended to keep using intranasal steroid ins in the covid-19 patients with allergic rhinitis 40 although it may be revised later with new studies it is also recommended to maintain the use of local intranasal corticosteroids because sneezing could get worse and the virus could spread easily if the patients stop using ins ins is supposed to have relatively less risky than systemic steroids because the rate of systemic bioavailability of ins is less than 1 42 but further studies are needed to confirm if ins may be effective for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction and for the change of clinical course in the covid-19 patients it was reported that the treatments used for olfactory dysfunction were nasal saline irrigations 167 nasal corticosteroids 81 oral corticosteroids 25 and others 25 however in actual clinical field most of the patients with olfactory dysfunction did not receive any treatment 9 olfactory training simple and easy can bring positive results on the recovery for anosmia by viral infection but there is no definite guideline for olfactory training in the covid-19 patients but a few papers recommend that early olfactory training before 12 months from the onset of anosmia could have positive results in the patients with anosmia and viral infection including covid-19 3743 besides steroid and olfactory training zinc sulfate theophylline ginkgo biloba vitamins nasal decongestants or other medicine could also be considered to treat olfactory dysfunction saline washing nasal saline irrigation should be considered carefully because it could make virus more contagious 9 however except for the corticosteroid the effects of other medicine have not been proven 37 most of the patients with gustatory dysfunction did not have any special treatment either using l-carnitine or vitamins 9 the recovery of olfactory function is relatively slower in sensorineural dysfunction than conductive olfactory dysfunction and permanent functional loss might be caused 21 there are a few studies for the recovery of olfactory function in covid-19 infected patients yet in usa 74 of 38 cured patients from covid-19 were reported to show the recovery of anosmia 14 in france mean duration of anosmia was within 2 weeks and 55 of 44 patients recovered more after 1week and 20 recovered more after 2 weeks in spain mean duration of anosmia was also within 2 weeks and 40 of 30 patients recovered completely around 1 week later 74  23 days 13 according to the study from europe a total of 357 patients 856 had olfactory dysfunction from a total of 417 covid-19 infected patients but among 59 clinically cured patients only 44 is reported to show the recovery of olfactory function in short term period within 14 days most of whom 726 of patients with recovered olfactory dysfunction showed a recovery within 8 days only a small number of patients 34 showed a recovery more than 15 days after the covid-19 resolution among the clinically cured patients who had residual olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction 539 complained of only olfactory dysfunction 225 only gustatory dysfunction and 236 both remaining olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions 9 the time to decide the recovery of olfactory function was suggested to be 2 weeks because the viral loading significantly reduces in about 14 days 944 but the further study requires to decide the time to recovery and follow up long term later considering from the other viral infections the partial or complete recovery of olfactory function could take several months 45 and in case of anosmia after sars the patient was reported to suffer from anosmia continuously more than 2 years 18 the ongoing covid-19 epidemic is still rapidly spreading all over the world so it is very important to notice the early sign of covid-19 and get the information about progression as soon as possible most of covid-19 patients complain of no symptoms or mild symptoms in early stages though coughing fever and difficulty breathing are main symptoms up to date the number of the covid-19 patients with olfactory andor gustatory symptoms is rapidly increasing and though the onset of olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the covid-19 patients was reported varied in general most of these 2 symptoms might precede or be accompanied by other main mild general symptoms or no other symptoms 16 moreover many cases 182 have been reported for the covid-19 patients to complain of these 2 symptoms suddenly without any other otolaryngologic symptoms like rhinorrhea or nasal obstructions 9 based on the previous paper the rates of asymptomatic cases out of all sars-cov positive cases were reported 13 among singaporean health care workers 46 furthermore according to who report for mers-cov 21 of the 2228 cases from all over the world were reported to have no or mild symptoms 47 asymptomatic case proportion of covid-19 was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation which was higher than sars-cov and mers-cov according to kcdc report on 6 april 2020 22 therefore we should pay more attention to olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the suspicious covid-19 patients with or without the main covid-19 symptoms because asymptomatic covid-19 infection andor transmission is a major public health issue at present however the exact rate of asymptomatic covid-19 all over the world has not known and further analysis should be done even though the pathophysiologic mechanism of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions in covid-19 patients has not been clearly identified yet it is also very interesting that the clinical manifestations of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions were different according to gender or races moreover it is necessary to follow the clinical course and the long-term results of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in the cured covid-19 patients although there is still a lack of our understanding of covid-19 the number of covid-19 patients is rapidly increasing all over the world based on the recent reports and studies sudden olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions may be the early signs of covid-19 though all olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions are not caused only by covid-19 even at present therefore if there are any persons complaining of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in covid 19 pandemic areas it is suggested that accurate and urgent diagnostic test for covid-19 should be applied by doing so health providers can get an opportunity to prepare personal protective equipment in advance and isolate the suspected asymptomatic patients or with mild symptom to prevent the further spread of covid-19 the authors have no financial conflicts of interest     einer ausgebildeten industriearbeiterschaft das berragende interesse der usa an einer stabilen weltwirtschaftsordnung mit offenen mrkten war also durchaus auch eigenntzig nur stabile mrkte mit klaren handelsregeln waren aufnahmebereit fr us-waren mit wechselnden motiven untersttzten die usa in den folgenden dekaden die

for shellfish fish and live animals located in the chinese city of wuhan in the province of hubei the first case reported was that of a market worker who was admitted to hospital on 26 december 2019 with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure on 31 december the regional office in china of the world health organisation who was informed of several cases of pneumonia with an unknown origin in the city of wuhan 1 on 12 january 2020 china shared the genetic sequence of a new coronavirus it was denominated sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes was termed coronavirus disease 2019  the first who report on 20 january confirmed 282 cases the majority in hubei province with 6 deaths and international expansion with the first cases in thailand japan and south korea 2 at the close of this editorial 20 may 2020 the last report by the who on the situation of covid-19 reports 4731458 cases in the world with 316169 deaths 3  in spain by 19 may 232037 pcr-confirmed cases of covid-19 had been reported together with 27778 deaths 4 it is the european country with the third largest number of cases and is fourth in terms of the number of deaths with a lethality rate estimated to stand at 12 of confirmed cases below the rates in france belgium the united kingdom italy the netherlands and sweden at world level it is the fifth country in the ranking of the number of cases and deaths the high number of infected medical workers stands out in spain 39349 these amount to 223 of the cases of covid-19 reported to the national network of epidemiological monitoring renave with a clear predominance of women 76 5 reading the two previous paragraphs shows the vertiginous speed with which we experienced the rapid international spread of the virus in which spain was one of the main countries to be affected different parts of the country were affected to different degrees and spain like other countries has required a social lockdown such as never been seen before in recent history the healthcare system suffered an enormous impact due to the high demand for care due to patients with covid-19 and because of the initial lack of knowledge about this pathology which meant that extraordinary measures had to be adopted to prevent the system from collapsing although the pandemic curve has now been flattened we are still immersed in a medical crisis that has led to a social and economic crisis with an enormous impact on the population that may lead to a severe worldwide humanitarian crisis due to the national and international situation with covid-19 at the beginning of april the editorial team of the revista espaola de medicina legal reml decided to make this edition a monograph on the medical and legal aspects of the pandemic the aim is to offer readers a compendium of the most relevant information in our field based on the huge amount of scientific production in national and international biomedical journals this is not the first monograph to be published by the reml as these have covered subjects such as gender-based violence 6 suicide 7 the new criterion for traffic accidents in 2015 8 sudden death due to cardiac causes 9 or forensic psychiatry 10 given the exceptional nature of this situation and the importance of making the contents available as soon as possible it was decided that the editorial team would review the manuscripts rather than external reviewers we would like to sincerely thank the authors for their generous collaboration in this monograph and we hope that it will be both useful and interesting for reml readers we also decided that the monograph would cover medical-legal problems as well as strictly medical-forensic questions this is why it covers such a broad range of subjects ban et al 11 analyse autopsies of covid-19 cases in a paper that brings the subject right up-to-date in comparison with publications up to now gonzlez-fernndez et al cover the management of corpses during a pandemic 12 the region which suffered the highest rate of infections in spain was the community of madrid donat et al describe the specific response of the legal medicine and forensic sciences institute instituto de medicina legal y ciencias forenses of the community of madrid which had commenced working just before the pandemic struck 13 certification of death during the covid-19 pandemic has been one of the central themes in who recommendations as well as the note prepared by the general board of official doctors associations in spain general de colegios oficiales de mdicos de espaa 14 analysis of mortality is one of the cornerstones of epidemiology and it has to be used as a guide that makes it possible to reach decisions and implement measures that are more effective means of controlling the current covid-19 pandemic 15 the quality of information in the medical death certificate mdc is crucial in this respect and as is the case in spain the document has to meet who recommendations 16 teijeira et al describe the medical-legal ethics and practical aspects of the certification of death and they refer specifically to this certification during a pandemic 17 they include one of the outstanding questions in our country sending mdc to the civil registration offices cro by data transmission which would speed up the transmission of information relating to causes of death an especially important aspect during an epidemic fernndez et al undertake an excellent review of the microbiological aspects of covid-19 the section on the post mortem detection of sars-cov-2 and its applicability is especially innovative 18 the impact on the healthcare sector in spain has been tremendous due to this two papers examine this repercussion specifically martin-fumad et al do so from a bioethical and professional ethics viewpoint they examine the difficult clinical decisions that have to be made within the context of an overwhelmed medical system and the rationing of resources above all at the start of the crisis within the context of hospitals 19 mart-amengual et al in a context in which 65 of infected medical professionals had an epidemiological history of the risk of contact with patients who had a respiratory infection while 69 had been in close contact with probable or confirmed covid-19 cases 5  argue that the legal consideration of this infection should be as an occupational disease with all of the resulting repercussions in terms of disability sequelae and death 20 lorente-acosta describes the problem of increasing gender-based violence associated with the lockdown and how it amplifies its components there was a striking increase in this violence after lockdown 21 other medical-legal subjects of interest that it was not possible to cover include the involuntary internment of covid-19 patients for public health reasons based on law 31986 and processed by an administrative contentious court according to article 86 of law 291998 22 23 as well as the problem of medicalpsychological care for those sectioned with mental disease during the pandemic 24 due to their association with medical-forensic work we must also refer to two subjects that were of central importance during this crisis performing autopsies and mortality data on 5 march the technical document of the ministry of health was published procedure for the management of covid-19 corpses with subsequent modifications 25 although it refers to clinical autopsies this document set the tendency as it recommended not performing autopsies in positive cases for covid-19 so that the general form of action in our country was to avoid performing internal examinations given that forensic autopsies are one of the essential services of the ministry of justice the forensic medical board also recommended reducing the handling and transport of corpses subjected to judicial investigation to the indispensible minimum although it recommended that the legal medicine and forensic sciences institutes imlcf set their own protocols 26 all of this in the context of a crisis which reduced the number of medical-legal autopsies above all those due to accidental causes as is described in madrid 13 likewise in milan italy a 70 fall in medical-legal autopsies was observed during the crisis 27 the recommendation no to perform autopsies was controversial to a certain degree the spanish society of pathology published a press release on 21 april explaining the arguments for the initial recommendation and also making it more flexible 28 this was also because of the important role that autopsy may play in gaining knowledge of many aspects of the disease 29 this question was also debated in italy 30 the subject of mortality was also highly controversial teijeira et al refer to this in their final section 17 there were delays in sending demographic information based on inscriptions in the cro and one of the affected institutions was the national epidemiology centre of the carlos iii health institute the national epidemiology centre maintains the daily mortality monitoring system momo which identifies deviations in daily mortality for all causes from what would be expected based on historical series it obtains this data from the ministry of justice general registry of civil and notaries registries that receives computerised cro data through the inforeg platform there are 3929 cro covering 93 of the spanish population 31 momo estimates that there was an increase in mortality in the period from 17 march to 5 may 2020 with an excess of 30604 deaths a 557 increase most especially of people over the age of 65 years old although all of the autonomous communities showed an increase in mortality the percentage of increase varied as did the time period although their reports take the delay in notification into account the increase in deaths and the fall in the number of cro staff due to the crisis hindered the daily updating of this information in response to this the general board of judicial security and public trust of the ministry of justice gave instructions to speed up and increase the accuracy of data about the number of deaths and where they had occurred these instructions were to send a list every day of the number of deaths recorded by the registry the number of burial licences granted and the place of death specifying the locality and place hospital care home or usual domicile 32 these measures refer to the number of deaths but not to their causes mdc are sent every month by the cro to the provincial offices of the national institute of statistics ine in turn this sends them every month to the mortality registries of the autonomous communities which code the basic cause of death according to the norms of the tenth edition of the internal classification of diseases cid-10 and then send the information to the ine the ine then processes and assigns these data and generates annual statistical death files according to cause of death which are published annually the ine places the definitive file of deaths which have occurred in the territory each community at the disposal of the same as well as those showing the deaths of residents in the other autonomous communities additionally the mortality registries draw up their own mortality reports nevertheless in an epidemic crisis it is necessary to establish a specific mortality monitoring system that makes it possible to know the causes of all deaths almost immediately this was not implemented in a general way in our country and this is a function in which forensic doctors and the imlcf could play a major role there was a good initiative in the autonomous community of castile y len where taking advantage of the function of forensic doctors in supervising mdc they informed the general board of health of the regional government of castile y len of all of the deaths that had occurred age sex causes and place of death it should be remembered that in the context of deaths with judicial intervention the imlcf already cooperate satisfactorily with the ine in improving the quality of cause of death reporting by using an online platform 33 given the beneficial impact of this cooperation 34 the participation of forensic doctors and the imlcf in specific mortality monitoring circuits would be a highly interesting option for cooperation with the health ministry in a second wave of the virus in autumn or in new medical crises and this would raise the social and medical profile of forensic medicine emphasising its value 35 to conclude we hope that this monograph on covid-19 published by the revista espaola de medicina legal will interest forensic doctors and doctors who specialise in legal medicine as well as the scientific and medical community in general given that the papers it contains are currently of great interest  the v-sis oncoprotein loses transforming activity when targeted to the early golgi complex kristen hart c you-feng xu april meyer n bruce lee a daniel donoghue j  the location of autocrine interactions between the v-sis protein and pdgf receptors remains uncertain and controversial to examine whether receptor-ligand interactions can occur intracellularly we have constructed fusion proteins that anchor v-sis to specific intracellular membranes fusion of a cis-golgi retention signal from a coronavirus e1 glycoprotein to v-sis protein completely abolished its transforming ability when transfected into nih3t3 cells fusion proteins incorporating mutations in this retention signal were not retained within the golgi complex but instead were transported to the cell surface resulting in efficient transformation all chimeric proteins were shown to dimerize properly derivatives of some of these constructs were also constructed bearing the cytoplasmic tail from the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-g these constructs allowed examination of subcellular localization by double-label immunofluorescence using antibodies that distinguish between the extraceuular pdgf-related domain and the vsv-g cytoplasmic tail colocalization of sis-e1-g with golgi markers confirmed its targeting to the early golgi complex the sis-e1 constructs targeted to the early golgi complex exhibited no proteo-lyric processing whereas the mutant forms of sis-e1 exhibited normal proteolytic processing treatment with suramin a polyanionic compound that disrupts ligandreceptor interactions at the cell surface was able to revert the transformed phenotype induced by the mutant sis-e1 constructs described here our results demonstrate that autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and pdgf receptors within the early golgi complex do not result in functional signal transduction another v-sis fusion protein was constructed by attaching the transmembrane domain and coohterminus of tgn38 a protein that localizes to the trans-golgi network tgn this construct was primarily retained intracellularly although some of the fusion protein reached the surface deletion of the cooh-terminal region of the tgn38 retention signal abrogated the tgn-localization as evidenced by very prominent cell surface localization and resulted in increased transforming activity the behavior of the sis-tgn38 derivatives is discussed within the context of the properties of tgn38 itself which is known to recycle from the cell surface to the tgn  t ransformation and tumorigenesis are frequently associated with the abnormal expression of growth factors and their receptors many oncogenes have been shown to be homologues of normal cellular proteins as in the case of the retroviral oncogene v-sis  which is homologous with the b chain of plateletderived growth factor pdgf doolittle et al 1983 waterfield et al 1983  expression of the v-sis protein activates cellular pdgf receptors resulting in the stimulation of signal transduction pathways that ultimately leads to cellular transformation autocrine transformation sporn and todaro 1980 oc-curs when the same cell expresses pdgf receptors as well as the v-sis protein in this situation there also exists the possibility of intracellular ligandreceptor interactions within the secretory pathway betsholtz et al 1986  the secretory pathway consists of functionally distinct compartments including the endoplasmic reticulum er and the entire golgi apparatus consisting of the cis-golgi network the cis- medial- and trans-golgi cisternae as well as the trans-golgi network tgn t macharner 1993 pelham 1991  determination of the site of autocrine ligandreceptor interactions has distinct implications for the treatment of human cancers that exhibit autocrine activation of signal transduction pathways if autocrine interactions only occur on the cell surface then transformed cells should be responsive to treatment with exogenous substances that disrupt these interactions however if such interactions occur intracellularly such as in the er or the golgi complex then addition of such antagonism will not be sufficient to revert transformation thus it is of vital importance both from a clinical and a molecular standpoint to understand fully the mechanism and cellular location of autocrine interactions between ligands and receptors there exists considerable controversy over the biological significance of intracellular interactions between v-sis and the pdgf-receptor it has been demonstrated that mitogenesis can be blocked in some sis-transformed cells by treating them with antibodies against pdgf huang et al 1984  while these results indicate that cell surface interactions between the v-sis protein and pdgf receptors are important in the transformation process these same researchers demonstrated that some sis-transformed cells did not detectably secrete v-sis protein and anti-pdgf antibody did not affect transformation this implies that an intracellular mechanism of autocrine transformation may also exist other researchers have reported that in normal cells pdgf only activates receptors present on the cell surface but that in sis-transformed cells intracellular receptors are activated and undergo autophosphorylation in an autocrine fashion keating and williams 1988 bejcek et al 1992  there is also evidence that e5 the transforming protein of bovine papillomavirus can interact with immature intracellular forms of pdgf receptors stimulating their autophosphorylation activity goldstein et al 1992 petti and dimaio 1992 cohen et al 1993  since receptor autophosphorylation represents a key event in activating pdgf-mediated signaling pathways williams 1989  these intracellular forms of the receptors may be able to transmit signals that lead to autocrine transformation of cells however it is not clear whether the downstream effectors of pdgf-stimulated signaling are accessible from intracellular compartments bejcek et al 1992 have demonstrated that internally activated receptors may associate with pi-3 kinase in a manner similar to mature cell surface pdgf receptors suggesting that these receptors may indeed be capable of signaling from within the cell indirect methods that rely upon pharmacologic agents have been used by some researchers in attempts to identify the site of ligandreceptor interactions monensin has been shown to block transport of proteins through the trans-golgi portion of the secretory pathway tartakoff 1983  treatment of v-sis-expressing cells with monensin prevents autophosphorylation of mature pdgf receptors and expression of c-fos a nuclear protein involved in cellular growth regulation suggesting that v-sis must be transported beyond the point of monensins inhibitory activity past the trans-golgi portion in order to activate signal transduction pathways hannink and donoghue 1988  however monensin exerts pleiotropic effects on cations within cells so other cellular events may have been affected in these experiments suramin a potent inhibitor of proliferation of cells expressing v-sis and pdgf receptors seems to interfere only with ligandreceptor interactions at the cell surface reducing the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors suramin has little or no effect on intracellular phosphorylated receptors fleming et al 1989  this suggests a requirement for cellsurface interactions between receptor and ligand for expres-sion of a transformed phenotype however the mechanism of action of surarnin is unclear and there is evidence that it accumulates within endosomes hawking 1978  thus experiments utilizing agents such as monensin or suramin have been viewed as problematic by some researchers therefore we have recently exploited more direct approaches to address this issue of intraceuular ligandreceptor interactions the recent identification of specific targeting and retention signals makes it possible to localize v-sis protein to specific intracellular compartments this potentially allows one to scan the secretory pathway for compartments that allow functional transforming interactions between v-sis and pdgf receptors this represents a powerful approach for examining autocrine interactions and can be applied to other autocrine growth factors or systems as well er-anchored forms of v-sis were previously constructed by this lab using an adenovirus transmembrane protein e319k retention signal dekkmp nilsson et al 1989  these constructs prevented cell surface expression of v-sis protein as determined by immunofluorescence and transformation was inhibited by retention of the fusion protein in the er  in this report we continued our analysis of autocrine transformation from within secretory pathway compartments by creating novel v-sis fusion proteins targeted to unique subcellular compartments one signal that we chose was the cis-golgi localization signal represented by the first transmembrane domain of the avian coronavirus e1 glycoprotein el of infectious bronchitis virus which has been shown by others to target heterologous proteins such as vsv-g and cm a derivative of the human chorionic gonadotropin-c subunit to the cis-golgi complex swift and machamer 1991  in addition we chose to exploit the tgn-localization signal of the protein tgn38 contained within its transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail which has been shown to retarget heterologous proteins such as the ldl receptor and the tac antigen to the tgn bos et al 1993 humphrey et al 1993  the resulting sis fusion proteins referred to as sis-e1 and sis-tgn38 allowed a further characterization of the site of autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and pdgf receptors plasmid pmsl50 encoding the v-sis gene under control of the rous sarcoma virus promoter was used as a parental clone to make the fusion proteins the dna sequence encoding amino acids 238-271 of v-sis is easily removed from pms150 as a bsteii-clai fragment allowing for insertion of novel sequences to create various fusion constructs optimized oligonucleotide synthesis and purification were as previously described xu et al 1993  the complementary oligonucleotides for each fusion protein were designed so that when annealed 5 bsteii and 3 clai overhangs were produced oligonucleotides were then ligated with vector dna pms150 previously digested with bsteii and clai and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis recombinant clones were recovered and the sequences of the oligonucleotides were confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing for example the sis-e1 contsruct required synthesis of sense and antisense oligonucleotides designated d369 and d370 respectively the sequence of d369 is 5gtgacctataacctgttcatcaccgccttc ctgctgttcctg ac c atc atcctgcagtatgctatgccacc cggagcaagtaat y this oligonucleotide encodes the amino acid sequence vtynlfitafllfltiilqygyatrsk where the first two amino acids correspond to amino acids 238 and 239 of v-sis which lie at the bsteii restriction site the remaining sequence corresponds to amino acids 21--45 of el which encompasses the first transmembrane domain swift and machamer 1991  mutant versions of sis-e1 designated sis-elql and sis-elins were also constructed in the same manner the complementary oligonucleotides encoding sis-elins are designated i419 and i420 and code for the sequence vtynlfitafliilfltiilqygyatrsk which contains an insertion of two lie residues between amino acids 29 and 30 of e1 shown in bold italics the oligonucleotides encoding the other mutant sis-elql are designated d421 and d422 and code for the sequence vtynlfitafllfltiil1ygyatrsk which contains a mutation of glu37 to lie shown in bold italics similar constructs were also designed to encode an extended cytoplasmic tail derived from vsv-g the oligonucleotides encoding sis-e1-g were designated d455 and d456 the sense strand oligonucleotide i455 encodes the amino acid sequence vtynlfitafllfltiilqygyatrvgihlcik-lkhtkkrqiytdiemnrlgk the first 25 amino acids are the same as in the sis-el construct but the final 28 originate from the cooh-terminus of the vsv-g protein sis-eiqi-g and sis-elins-g were constructed in the same manner the final constructs utilize the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of tgn38 sis-tgn38 was encoded by oligonucleotides d496 and d497 the sense strand oligonucleotide d496 encodes the amino acid sequence vtesshffaylvtaavlvavlyiayhnkrkiiafalegkrskv-trrpkasdyqrlnlkl again the first two amino acids correspond to 238 and 239 of v-sis and the remaining 57 amino acids correspond to residues 284-340 of tgn38 encoding the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of this protein a mutant version sis-tgn38a was also constructed using oligonncleotides 13498 and d499 these oligonucleotides encode a truncated version of the sequence shown above vtesshffa-ylvtaavlvavlyiayhnkrs and with the final amino acid changed from a lysine to a serine the parental vector contains an xhoi restriction site just upstream of the v-sis coding sequence for use in transfection and infection of nih3t3 cells dna fragments encoding the above described v-sis-fusion proteins were subcloned as xhoi-clai restriction fragments into the murine leukemia virus mlv expression vector pms177 which was derived from the previously described retroviral

have a 39-amino acid section of the glycoprotein g from the vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-g fused to the cytoplasmic tail the mutant forms of these constructs should abolish the signals golgi-retention capabilities the final two constructs have a section of tgn38 a tgnlocalized protein encoding the transmembrane domain and c-terminal tail amino acids 284-340 fused to v-sis a mutant form was made by truncating the cytoplasmic tail region and thus uses only amino acids 284-311 of tgn38 this construct should not be retained intracellularly proteins constructed for these experiments the first three constructs sis-g sis-g-er  and sisg-er- were described previously  and served as a basic model for the construction of these new fusion proteins in all cases the first 239 amino acids of v-sis are included in the fusion proteins this portion of v-sis provides a signal sequence a dibasic proteolytic processing site and the 82-amino acid minimal transforming region hannink and donoghue 1986b sauer et al 1986 giese et al 1987 sauer and donoghue 1988  all constructs are in type i orientation-the nh2 terminus is out and the cooh terminus in the sis-e1 fusion incorporates a 25-amino acid segment of the avian coronavirus e1 protein containing the entire first transmembrane domain of e1 and a short cytoplasmic tail this region has been shown to confer localization of e1 to the cis-golgi cisternae allowing for assembly of the coronavirus to occur at intracellular membranes swift and machamer 1991 machamer et al 1990  when incorporated into heterologous proteins this e1 transmembrane domain can function as a cis-golgi localization signal as shown by incorporation of this transmembrane domain into fusion proteins with vsv-g and a m a human chorionic gonadotropinvsv-g fusion protein swift and machamer 1991  the sis-elqi construct incorporates a mutation that changes gin 37 to fie and this mutation abolishes correct localization swift and machamer 1991  the sis-elins construct contains an insertion of two lie residues in the transmembrane domain which similarly abolishes cis-golgi localization the sis-e1-g constructs are quite similar to the above but they have an extended cooh-terminal domain provided by a portion of the g protein from vsv-g rose and gallione 1981  the addition of the g tail allows for doublelabel immunofluorescence experiments to be performed and does not significantly alter the localization efficiency or function of the fusion proteins as described below the membrane-anchor region of sis-tgn38 consists of 59 amino acids containing the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of tgn38 a type i-oriented protein which was isolated from rat liver golgi membranes luzio et al 1990 and is normally localized to the tgn ladinsky and howell 1992 bos et al 1993 reaves et al 1993  a tyrosine-containing motif tyr-gln-arg-leu yqrl in the cooh-terminal domain of tgn38 has been shown to be essential for tgn localization bos et al 1993 humphrey et al 1993 wong and hong 1993  this motif has also been shown to be sufficient for localizing heterologous proteins such as the ldl receptor and the tac antigen interleukin-2 receptor a-chain to the tgn bos et al 1993 humphrey et al 1993  a mutant version of the sis-tgn38 construct referred to as sis-tgn38a was constructed using only the 28 amino acids of tgn38 that encompass the transmembrane domain thus the sis-tgn38a construct lacks the essential tyrosine-containing motif and should not be retained in the tgn the transforming ability of the various v-sis fusion proteins was assayed by transfection of nih3t3 cells using mlvbased retroviral constructs bold and donoghue 1985  the relative ability to transform cells was based on the number of foci formed with both positive and negative mock controis for comparison the same amount of dna was transfected for each construct and the number of foci formed was normalized to the activity of the positive control sis-g as shown in table i  cells transfected with sis-e1 or sis-e1-g exhibited negligible transforming activity comparable to the mock-transfected cells the presence of the vsv-g cytoplasmic tail in the sis-e1-g construct seemed to have little or no effect on its transforming activity thus addition of the retention signal of the e1 protein abrogated the transforming potential of v-sis presumably by localizing virtually all of the fusion protein to an intracellular location incapable of autocrine stimulation in contrast all of the derivatives that incorporated mutations in the e1 localization signal including sis-elq1 sis-elq1-g sis-elins and sis-elins-g exhibited transformation with efficiencies ranging from 25-50 of sis-g table i  these fusion proteins were consistently less transforming the sis-g but this phenomenon has been observed before in our lab with other membrane-anchored derivatives of v-sis hannink and donoghue 1986a lee and donoghue 1991 xu et al 1993  this may result from the fact that these membrane-anchored ligands are restricted in their ability to diffuse and thus less likely to activate receptors as efficiently as the native secreted protein focus assays were also performed by transfecting nih3t3 cells with the sis-tgn38 and sis-tgn38a constructs table  i shows that when fused to a portion of tgn38 containing the tgn-localization signal v-sis can interact with the pdgf receptor to result in autocrine transformation with an efficiency of 32 of the sis-g control the mutant derivafive sis-tgn38a which lacks the tyrosine-containing tgn localization signal was consistently more active in transformarion assays exhibiting 55  as many foci as the sis-g control recently it was demonstrated that tgn38 recycles from the tgn to the cell surface reaves et al 1993  this observation complicates our results in that we are at this point unable to determine if the transforming potential of the sis-tgn38 fusion protein is due to a subpopulation of protein molecules present on the cell surface at any given time or whether it is truly mediated by ligandreceptor interactions occurring within the tgn further experiments will be needed to clarify this to verify that the constructs used in this study were capable of encoding the desired proteins the coding regions from each construct were swapped into a psp64polya vector promega biotec madison wi for in vitro transcription and translation experiments messenger rna was synthesized melton 1987 and translation reactions were performed in rabbit reticulate lysate in the presence of 35scys sds-page analysis of the products of these reactions demonstrated proteins with molecular weights that correlated with the expected sizes of each of the fusion proteins data not shown this indicates that our constructs encode the desired fusion proteins the results summarized in table i indicate that sis-e1 and sis-e1-g chimeric proteins are not able to cause transformation the most likely explanation is that these proteins are anchored in a cellular compartment where they are unable to functionally interact with pdgf receptors however one might postulate other explanations for the lack of transforming activity exhibited by these proteins for example a critical post-translational event may be altered by forcing v-sis to remain intracellular thereby abolishing its activity n-linked glycosylation of v-sis is not required for its biological activity sauer et al 1986  and bacteriauy-expressed pdgf-bb which has no n-or o-linked glycosylation is biologically active hoppe et al 1989  therefore glycosylation of v-sis although altered in these fusion proteins does not constitute a critical processing event however v-sis must dimerize in order to function  so perhaps these fusion proteins do not dimerize correctly to address this we infected nih3t3 cells with viral supernatants collected from cells transfected with the indicated v-sis fusion constructs see legend to fig 2  the fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using the a-sis antibody and one half of the sample was treated with nonreducing sample buffer to examine dimeric proteins while the other half was treated with reducing sample buffer to examine monomeric forms fig 2  lanes 3 and 9 shows that the sis-e1 chimera indeed dimerizes yielding a dimer band of 62-64 kd under nonreducing conditions and a 32-kd monomer band un-der reducing conditions comparison of the left and right panels of fig 2 further illustrates that all of the chimeric proteins dimerize as expected indicating that this critical processing event is not altered in the fusion proteins thus these data suggest that the transforming activity of the v-sis fusion proteins described here most closely correlates with their subcellular localization within the cell as verified further below rather than resulting from differences in posttranslational processing events like most other secreted proteins v-sis undergoes a variety of posttranslational modifications as it passes through the secretory pathway one of these processing events is cleavage at a dibasic site to release the propeptide region of the protein this is thought to occur late in the secretory pathway between the trans-cistemae of the golgi complex and the plasma membrane robbins et al 1985 lokeshwar et al 1990  thus sis-e1 and sis-el-g if retained in the early golgi complex should not undergo this processing step the mutant versions of these two fusion proteins however should reach the cell surface and thus should exhibit processing of this propeptide similarly the sis-tgn38 and sis-tgn38a fusion proteins both should exhibit processing since these should be either retained in a compartment that is past the site of this modification or be present on the cell surface to examine proteolytic processing of our fusion proteins nih3t3 cells expressing the desired proteins were metabolically labeled with 35scys and 35smet and labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated and separated by sds-page as shown in fig 3  the sis-e1-g protein showed no detectable processed forms fig 3 lane 2  implying retention in an early golgi compartment on the other hand the mutant derivatives sis-elql-g and sis-elins-g both exhibited processing which appears as a doublet of lower mo- lecular mass bands fig 3 lanes 3 and 4 indicated by arrows similar results were obtained using the constructs lacking the g tail data not shown the diffuse signal above the major bands most likely represents heterogeneity of o-linked oligosaccharides which although previously observed  have not been extensively characterized in summary these results are consistent with localization of sis-e1 and sis-e1-g to the early golgi complex whereas the proteins encoded by the other constructs have clearly progressed through the secretory pathway beyond the trans-golgi complex cleavage of the propeptide region of v-sis is not required for its activity as demonstrated initially in previous work from this laboratory in which the lys-arg cleavage site of v-sis was mutated to asn-ser with no change in biological activity saner et al 1986  in subsequent studies from our lab the kr to ns mutation has been incorporated into a variety of membrane-anchored derivatives hannink and donoghue 1986b lee and donoghue 1992 xu et al 1993  including sis-g and sis-g-er- with no effect on biological activity this is an important point as the constructs that are retained in the early golgi sis-e1 and sis-el-g would not be expected to undergo this cleavage process thus we can conclude that the inactivity of these proteins is not due to their lack of propeptide cleavage to examine the subcellular location of v-sis fusion proteins nih3t3 cells were transfected with mlv expression constructs and then processed for immunofluorescence the proteins were detected by an antibody to the v-sis portion of the fusion proteins as visualized in the permeabilized cells shown in fig 4  there was a high level of expression for all the fusion proteins presented in this figure see fig 4  a c e and g staining can be seen of the er and golgi of these cells indicating the presence of these fusion proteins throughout the secretory compartment the cells depicted in fig 4 are representative of the positive cells seen in these transient expression assays the percentage of cells expressing the desired constructs typically ranged from ol-5  surface staining of nonpermeabilized cells was readily detectable for cells expressing sis-elins sis-elql and sis-tgn38a derivatives see fig 4  b d and h indicating that these fusion proteins are efficiently transported to the cell surface as expected the sis-tgn38 construct f displays decreased but detectable surface staining indicating that a portion of the population of this protein reaches the cell surface this is consistent with the behavior of native tgn38 which has been shown to recycle between the tgn and the cell surface reaves et al 1993  since a small amount of this sis-qgn38 fusion protein reaches the cell surface this may explain the transforming activity of this construct in the focus formation assays see table i  however at this time we have no way of determining if the tgnretained population of the fusion protein contributes in any way to the transforming activity while fig 4 clearly demonstrates that the sis-e1 mutants and the sis-tgn38 derivatives reach the cell surface it does not answer the question of whether the sis-e1 or sis-e1-g fusions do not reach the surface to address this question double-label immunofluorescence was performed using the constructs bearing the vsv-g cytoplasmic tail this allowed for simultaneous examination of both intracellular and cell surface populations of the various fusion proteins within the same cell cell surface protein was detected with an antibody against v-sis the cells were then permeabilized and intracellular fusion proteins were detected with a monoclonal antibody to the vsv-g protein as positive controls both the sis-elins-g and the sis-elql-g fusion proteins were included in this assay as in fig 4 fig 5 shows that these proteins were readily detected within the cell e and g as well as on the cell surface f and h as another control sis-g was included this fusion protein was created in our lab for previous experiments and it localizes to the cell surface hannink and donoghue 1986a  a and b of fig 5 clearly demonstrate both intracellular and surface staining for this construct c demonstrates the reticular and perinuclear intracellular staining consistently seen for sis-el-g indicating presence of this protein within the er and golgi complex when looking for sis-e1-g protein on the surface of the same cell d demonstrates that there is no detectable surface staining as with fig 4  these were transient expression assays and the typical percentage of cells expressing the transfected fusion constructs was ol-5  we deliberately examined cells expressing high levels of protein within the cell so that even weak cell surface staining would be detectable although deliberate selection of high-expressing cells tended to obscure any detail present in the permeabilized cells the issue of whether sis-e1 and sis-e1-g are in fact localized to the early golgi complex is addressed in colocalization experiments in the subsequent section the cell featured in fig  5 is representative of all sis-el-g-expressing cells in that we were never able to detect protein on the cell surface thus the cis-golgi retention signal of the e1 glycoprotein when appended to the v-sis protein results in efficient retention of the fusion protein to an intracellular compartment to demonstrate that sis-e1 and sis-e1-g fusion proteins are indeed targeted to the early golgi complex we have used double-label immunofluorescence to colocalize these chimeric proteins with known golgi markers the golgi markers used were a lens culinaris lectin a carbohydratebinding protein that binds to terminal o-mannosyl and o-dglucosyl residues kornfeld et al 1981  and has been shown to stain primarily the golgi complex of cells hsu et al 1992 machamer et al 1993  and b a monoclonal antibody 10et described by wood et al 1991  which was localized to the cis-golgi complex of nrk cells by immunoelectron microscopy in these studies the sis-e1-g chimera was expressed in nih3t3 cells by infection with retroviral supernatants and was detected in fixed and permeabilized cells with a polyclonal rabbit antisera to v-sis this in turn was visualized with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg to visualize the golgi complex these same cells were treated with either a fluorescein-conjugated lens culinaris lectin or with the mouse mab 10e6 which was visualized with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg the two cells shown for each condition in fig 6 are representative cells expressing various fusion proteins were processed for immunofluorescence surface proteins were detected by a rabbit serum directed against the v-sis protein and rhodamine-conjugated goat antirabbit antibody b d f and h intracllular proteins were detected by a mouse mab against the cooh-terminal portion of the vsv-g protein and a biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody followed by fitc-conjugated streptavidin a c e and g a and b  sis-g c and d sis-el-g e and f sis-elins of the sis-el-g-expressing cells generated in these immunofluorescence assays the percentage of ceils expressing protein was higher using this infection protocol than that obtained by transient transfections this percentage varied from 10-15  as fig 6 shows the sis-e1-g fusion protein clearly colocalizes with both the lectin see a and b c and d and the mab 10e6 see e and f g and h thus the e1 cis-golgi targeting signal functions correctly and targets v-sis to the early golgi when incorporated into a fusion protein suramin is a polysulfonated naphthylurea derivative reported to inhibit pdgf mitogenic activity and to revert the v-sis transformed phenotype betsholtz et al 1986  it is postulated to exert this effect by disruption of ligand-receptor interactions that occur on the cell surface this mechanism of action is supported by the ability of suramin to reduce the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated cell surface pdgf receptors while having no effect on the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular immature forms of the receptors fleming et al 1989  since suramin has been shown to accumulate intraceuularly hawking 1978 la-rocca et al 1990  it may also be possible for it to interfere with intracellular interactions between receptor and ligand huang and huang 1988  to further examine the mechanism of transformation occurring in our cells we treated nih3t3 cells expressing the transforming constructs with suramin to see if the transformed phenotype would revert in its presence transformed cells expressing sis-elql sis-elins sis-q3n38 sis-tgn38a and v-sis as a positive control were examined in the absence of suramin fig 7  a c e g and i or in the presence of suramin fig 7 b d f h and j  in all cases suramin did indeed revert the phenotype it has been shown that e5 an oncoprotein derived from the bovine papillomavirus can interact with immature intracellular forms of pdgf receptors and may stimulate their autophosphorylation activity goldstein et al 1992 petti and dimaio 1992 cohen et al 1993  it has also been shown by xu et al 1993 that bpv-e5-transformed cells do not revert in the presence of suramin thus cells transformed by e5 were included as a negative control in the suramin reversion assay as expected the presence of suramin did not affect the transformed phenotype of nih3t3 cells expressing e5 fig 7  k and l these results indicate that the productive transforming interactions between pdgf receptors and the v-sis fusion proteins described here are occurring in a suraminsensitive site most likely the cell surface a normal response in cells that are chronically exposed to pdgf is the downregulation of pdgf receptors garrett et al 1984  this downregulation occurs via endocytosis of arrows indicate regions of each cell that stain positively for both the sis-e1-g fusion protein and the golgi complex to analyze if such a process occurred in cells expressing any of the v-sis fusion proteins described in this paper pdgf-3 receptors were immunoprecipitated from serum-starved cells expressing the fusion proteins either before or after stimulation with pdgf-bb these receptors were then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay and incorporation of labeled phosphate from 3-32patp into the receptor protein was visualized by sds-page as seen in fig 8  in the absence of stimulation with pdgf little or no activatable receptors were detected b lanes 1-9 after stimulation with pdgf-bb however nih3t3 cells mock-transfected cells and cells expressing sis-e1 all exhibited a significant level of cell surface activatable receptors a 1-3 as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of pdgf- receptors of 180 kd expression of the mutant sis-elql and sis-elins constructs which reach the cell surface led to downregulation of cell surface activatable receptors and thus there was little detectable kinase activity in these samples fig 8a lanes 4  and 5  similar results were obtained with sis-tgn38 sis-tgn38a and v-sis which also reach the cell surface  fig  81 lanes 6 7 and 8  these results demonstrate that when v-sis is forced to remain in an intracellular compartment such as the early golgi it is unable to downregulate cell surface pdgf receptors b d f h j and l  a and b c and d e and f g and h 1 and j k and l  retention of the v-sis oncogene in the early golgi complex by means of a transmembrane retention signal abolishes its transforming ability as demonstrated by a dramatic decrease in focus forming activity all fusion proteins constructed for these experiments dimerized properly indicating that this critical post-translational modification of the v-sis portion of the fusions was not altered the fusion proteins sis-e1 and sis-e1-g were efficiently retained intracellularly as evidenced by the lack of proteolytic processing of the constructs and lack of downregulated cell surface pdgf receptors immunofluorescence data are consistent with golgi localization of the sis-e1 and sis-e1-g constructs colocalization with lens culinaris lectin and mab 10e6 confirm targeting to the early golgi complex of the sis-e1 and sis-e1-g constructs mutant derivatives of the these constructs containing defects in the cis-golgi localization signal were not retained inside the cell and were transforming these proteins were proteolytically processed as expected and were detectable on the cell surface by immunofluorescence suramin reverted the transformation induced by these latter constructs providing further evidence that functional interactions between v-sis and pdgf receptors occur primarily on the cell surface the results obtained with the sis-e1 and sis-e1-g constructs indicate that the intracellular compartment of the early golgi complex does not allow for autocrine activation of pdgf receptors attempts to retain v-sis protein in a more distal golgi region by attachment of a tgn retention signal yielded ambiguous results while most of the sis-tgn38 fusion protein was retained intracellulady some of the protein was able to reach the cell surface as shown by immunofluorescence indeed it has been demonstrated recently that tgn38 actually recycles from the cell surface and back to the tgn reaves et al 1993  it is likely that this population of molecules that reached the cell surface was responsible for the transformation seen in the focus assays in cells expressing this fusion protein since treatment with suramin reverted the transformed phenotype however we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that functional autocrine interactions can occur in the tgn significantly however when the coohterminus of the tgn38-derived domain was truncated the transforming efficiency of the derivative sis-tgn38a nearly doubled table i  this data certainly provides a correlation between transformation and increased cell surface localization compared with tgn localization since v-sis-transformed ceils express both v-sis protein and pdgf receptors there exists the possibility that these two proteins can interact as they pass simultaneously through the secretory pathway keating and williams 1988 reported the detection of pdgf receptors that are activated intracellularly in v-sis-transformed cells these receptors were of an immature form as determined by their molecular mass 160 kd and lack of glycosylation huang and huang 1988 keating and williams 1988  and are rapidly degraded after stimulation by v-sis keating and williams 1988 bejcek et al 1992  high concentrations of antisera to pdgf were shown to be unable to reverse transformation of nrk cells also high levels of exogenously added v-sis protein have not been shown to cause transformation of nrk cells bejcek et al 1989  both of these observations suggest that an intracellular autocrine mechanism may exist these same researchers attached a six-amino acid er-retention signal sekdel to the v-sis protein and observed morphological transformation of cells expressing this fusion protein no secreted fusion protein was detectable bejcek and coworkers 1992 also have shown that v-sis but not endogenously expressed pdgf-a homodimers can activate pdgf receptors intracellularly thus the capacity of v-sis to act intracellularly may underlie its mechanism of transformation the kdel retention signal used by bejcek et al 1989 has since been shown to be a retrieval signal-not a true retention signal-allowing for return of escaped proteins to the er pelham 1991  there is also evidence that this signal allows some leakage of proteins to the cell surface zagouras and rose 1989  thus the finding that v-sis can transform cells with this kdel signal attached most likely indicates that an undetectable amount of the fusion protein was able to escape the er to a more distal location such as the cell surface where productive autocrine interactions occurred if protein was secreted it likely was rapidly internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and thus escaped detection indeed we have experienced difficulty in immunoprecipitating and detecting wild-type v-sis protein in transformed cells due to this rapid internalization data not shown a different er retention signal has been identified by nilsson et al 1989 from the adenovirus protein e319k lee and donoghue 1992 appended this signal to the cooh terminus of the v-sis protein and demonstrated that a the retention signal effectively retained v-sis in the er with no leakage to the cell surface as confirmed by immunofluorescence and b this er-retained form of v-sis was no longer able to transform nih3t3 cells in an autocrine fashion this evidence suggests that v-sis cannot productively interact with the pdgf receptor within this compartment hannink and donoghue 1988 constructed an inducible autocrine system in nih3t3 cells by placing the v-sis gene under control of the hsp70 heat shock promoter allowing for induction of v-sis expression by a short incubation at 45c with this system they demonstrated that productive interactions between v-sis and pdgf receptors occur in a monensininsensitive site since monensin acts by disrupting the structure and function of the trans-golgi complex and reduces the rate of transport of proteins to the cell surface tartakoff 1983  these results indicate that transformation only results when v-sis interacts with receptors in a region past the trans-golgi complex however since monensin is a pleiotropic agent there may have been other effects on the cells that were not taken into account also the temperature shock required for induction of the hsp70 promoter may have induced other endogenous heat shock proteins it has also been demonstrated that suramin treatment of v-sis-transformed cells reverts the transformed phenotype fleming et al 1989  and that suramin decreases phosphorylation levels of cell-surface pdgf receptors with little effect on intracellular receptor phosphorylation these experiments suggest that v-sis protein can interact with intracellular forms of the pdgf receptors in cells and stimulate autophosphorylation activity of these immature receptors but that activated receptors must reach a suramin-sensitive cell surface location in order to trigger the signal transduction cascade that leads to transformation previous experiments by lee and donoghue 1992 suggested that the er compartment of the secretory pathway does not support transforming interactions between v-sis and pdgf-r one reason that the sis-g-er  construct could not productively interact with pdgf-r could be that either the ligand or the receptors had not yet undergone critical posttranslational modifications required for functional interactions and signal transduction such modifications may occur in the golgi portion of the secretory pathway particularly modifications of n-linked oligosaccharide or the addition of o-linked oligosaccharide which are largely confined to the later golgi compartments we have previously demonstrated that except for disulfide bond formation which occurs in the er very shortly after translation further posttranslational modifications are not required for the biological activity of the v-sis protein hannink and donoghue 1986b sauer and donoghue 1988  however extensive oligosaccharide addition and modification to pdgf-r occurs and its importance is not clear keating and williams 1987  use of an early golgi retention signal-the first transmembrane domain of the e1 glycoprotein-allowed us to begin to investigate possible autocrine interactions within the golgi region by retaining v-sis as a fusion protein in this compartment this retention of the v-sis oncoprotein within the early golgi complex completely abrogated its transforming ability and thus we conclude that productive autocrine interactions cannot occur in the early secretory pathway localization of v-sis to the tgn by means of a retention signal derived from tgn38 resulted in decreased levels of transforming ability however immunofluorescence data indicate that a small portion of this sis-tgn38 fusion protein was able to reach the cell surface a finding that is consistent with reports by reaves et al 1993 that tgn38 recycles be tween the tgn and the cell surface suramin treatment of cells expressing sis-tgn38 leads to reversion of the transformed phenotype further implicating a cell surface pool of sis-tgn38 in the transformation of these cells however we are unable to conclusively determine from these experiments that v-sis targeted to the tgn is not transforming currently we are undertaking studies which should further clarify interactions within the late golgi compartments these new studies utilize a similar approach of constructing fusion proteins this time using the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic tails of well-characterized glycosyltransferases which are resident golgi enzymes these membrane anchors should give tighter retention in the later golgi compartments than seen with the tgn38-derived retention signal and will hopefully provide a conclusive indication of whether v-sis is able to engage in productive autocrine interactions within the late golgi complex while it has been established that immature forms of the pdgf-r can be stimulated by v-sis to undergo phosphorylation within the secretory pathway hannink and donoghue 1988 keating and williams 1988 bejcek et al 1992  the question remains-are these interactions functional that is does this simple intracellular interaction between v-sis and pdgf-r contribute to acquisition of the transformed phenotype one argument against this possibility is that the downstream effector molecules such as plc-3 kumjian et al 1989 meisenhelder et ai 1989 wahl et al 1989 morrison et al 1990  pi-3 kinase coughlin et ai 1989 kazlauskas and cooper 1989  ras-gap kazlauskas et al 1990  and others that normally interact with activated pdgf-r at the plasma membrane may not be available to the immature activated receptors present within the secretory pathway the evidence from bejcek et al 1992 that indicates the intracellularly phosphorylated immature forms of the receptor are capable of interacting with pi-3 kinase in 3t3 cells begins to address the functionality of intracellular v-sispdgf receptor interactions but far from answers the question future studies in our lab will be aimed at examining the availability of such effector molecules within the secretory pathway and whether they can indeed be activated intracellularly these studies will include attempts to retarget some members of the signal transduction machinery to the early golgi complex to see if this will then allow sis-e1 or sis-e1-g to signal from this compartment the results of these future studies should provide significant insight into the mechanisms of autocrine transformation  enabling and emerging technologies for social distancing a comprehensive survey cong nguyen t yuris saputra mulya nguyen van huynh ngoc-tan nguyen tran viet khoa bui tuan minh diep nguyen n dinh hoang thai thang vu x eryk dutkiewicz symeon chatzinotas bjrn ottersten  social distancing is crucial for preventing the spread of viral diseases illnesses such as covid-19 by minimizing the closely physical contact between people we can reduce chances of catching the virus and spreading it to the community this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how emerging technologies eg wireless and networking ai can enable encourage and even enforce social distancing to that end we provide a fundamental background of social distancing including basic concepts measurements models and propose practical scenarios we then discuss enabling wireless technologies which are especially effective and can be widely adopted in practice to keep distance and monitor people after that emerging technologies such as machine learning computer vision thermal ultrasound etc are introduced these technologies open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing eg symptom prediction detection and monitoring quarantined people and contact tracing finally we provide important open issues and challenges eg privacy-preserving cybersecurity in implementing social distancing in practice  covid-19 has completely changed the worlds view on pandemic with dire consequences to global health and economy within only four months from january to april 2020 210 countries and territories around the world have reported more than three million infected people including more than two hundred thousand deaths 1  beside the global health crisis covid-19 has also been causing massive economic losses eg a possible 25 unemployment rate in the us 2  one million people lost their jobs in canada during march 2020 3  14 million jobs lost in australia 4  and a projected global 3 gdp loss 5  resulting in a global recession as predicted by many experts 5 - 7  in such context there is an urgent need for solutions to contain the disease spread thereby reducing its negative impacts and buying more time for pharmaceutical solution development in the presence of contagious diseases such as sars h1n1 and covid-19 social distancing is an effective nonpharmaceutical approach to limit the disease transmission 8  20  27  social distancing refers to the measures that reduce the disease spread by reducing the frequency and closeness of human physical contacts such as closing public places eg schools workplaces avoiding mass gatherings and keeping a sufficient distance amongst people 8  9  by reducing the probability that the disease can be transmitted from an infected person to a healthy one social distancing can significantly reduce the diseases spread and severity if implemented properly at the early stages of a pandemic social distancing measures can play a key role in reducing the infection rate and delay the diseases peak thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and lowering death rates 8  20  27  fig 1 illustrates the effects of social distancing measures on the daily number of cases 11  as can be observed in fig 1a  social distancing can reduce the peak number of infected cases 27 to ensure that the number of patients does not exceed the public healthcare capacity moreover social distancing also delays the outbreak peak 27 so that there is more time to implement countermeasures furthermore social distancing can reduce the final number of infected cases 27  and the earlier social distancing is implemented the higher the effects will be as illustrated in fig 1b 11  during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic many governments have implemented various social distancing measures such as travel restrictions border control closing public places and warning their citizens to keep a 15-2 meters distance from each other when they have to go outside 12 - 14  nevertheless such aggressive and large-scale measures are not easy to implement eg not all public spaces can be closed and people still have to go outside for food healthcare or essential work in such context technologies play a key role in facilitating social distancing measures for example wireless positioning systems can effectively help people to keep a safe distance by measuring the distances between people and alerting them when they are too close to each other moreover other technologies such as artificial intelligence ai technologies can be used to facilitate or even enforce social distancing in this article we present a comprehensive survey on enabling and emerging technologies for social distancing the main aims are to provide fundamental background about social distancing as well as effective technologies that can be used to facilitate the social distancing practice in particular we first present basic concepts of social distancing together with its measurements models effectiveness and practical scenarios after that we review enabling wireless technologies which are especially effective in monitoring and keeping distance amongst people then we discuss various emerging technologies eg ai thermal computer vision ultrasound and visible light which have been introduced recently in order fig 1  effects of social distancing 11  to address many new issues related to social distancing eg contact tracing quarantined people detection and monitoring and symptom prediction finally some important open issues and challenges eg privacy-preserving cybersecurity for implementing technologies for social distancing will be discussed furthermore potential solutions together with future research directions are also highlighted and discussed in this section although there are few surveys related to localization and positioning systems eg 15 - 18  to the best of our knowledge this is the first survey in the literature discussing about technologies for social distancing it is important to note that due to the increasingly complex development of many types of viruses as well as the rapid growth of social interaction and globalization the concept of social distancing is not as simple as physical distancing in fact it also includes many non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures taken to prevent the spread of contagious disease such as monitoring detection and warning people as presented in table i  alternatively thanks to the significant development of emerging technologies eg ai data analytics many new solutions have been introduced recently which can make favorable conditions for practicing social distancing thus this survey aims to provide an overview of technologies together with their impacts to social distancing in practice as illustrated in fig 2  the rest of this paper is organized as follows we first provide a brief overview of social distancing and distance measurement methods in section ii then section iii and section iv discuss enabling wireless technologies and other emerging technologies for social distancing respectively after that we discuss open issues and future research directions of social distancing in section v and conclusions are given in section vi a social distancing 1 definition and classifications social distancing refers to the non-pharmaceutical measures to reduce the frequency of physical contacts and the contact distances between people during an infectious disease outbreak 10  social distancing methods can be classified into public and individual measures public measures include closing or reducing access to education institutions and workplaces canceling mass gatherings travel restrictions border control and quarantining buildings individual measures consist of isolation quarantine and encouragement to keep physical distances between people 9  although these measures can cause some negative impacts on the economy and individual freedom they play a crucial role in reducing the severity of a pandemic 10  if implemented properly social distancing can effectively reduce the transmission and severity of a disease thereby reducing the pressure on healthcare systems and allowing more time for government countermeasures 10  2 measurements and models the evaluation of social distancing measures is often based on several standardized approaches one of the main criteria for social distancing measures selection is the basic reproduction number r o which represents on average how many people a case ie an infectious person will infect during its entire infectious period 19  for example r o  1 indicates that every case will infect less than 1 person and thus the disease is declining in the considered population since the value of r o represents how quickly the disease is spreading r o has been one of the most important indicators for social distancing measures selection 20  27  mathematically r o can be determined by where ba is the average number of new cases an infectious person will infect per unit of time during the infectious period a and fa is the probability that the individual will remain infectious during the period a 19  besides showing the transmissibility of a disease r o also gives some intuitive ideas how to limit the disease spread as observed from 1 r o can be reduced in different ways ie to decrease ba or fa to reduce ba there are several approaches such as to lower the number of contacts the infected individuals make per unit of time eg avoid mass gatherings and public places closures or to reduce the probability that a contact will infect a new person eg by wearing masks to reduce fa the infected person needs to be cured or completely avoid contacts with the non-infected eg isolation and quarantine 3 effectiveness to evaluate the effectiveness of social distancing a common approach is to measure the attack rate which is the percentage of infected people in a susceptible population where everyone has no immunity in the beginning of the disease at the time of measurement 22  the attack rate reflects the severity of a disease at a given time and thus it has different values during the disease outbreak among these values the peak attack rate is often considered and compared to the current healthcare capacity eg intensive care unit capacity to see the current systems ability to handle the peak number of patients after the outbreak is over data is often collected to determine the final attack rate which is the ratio between the total number of infected cases in the population over the entire course of the outbreak social distancing measures are proven to be effective if implemented properly 22 - 28  different types of social distancing measures may have diverse levels of effectiveness on the disease spread in 22  the effect of social distancing measures at workplaces is evaluated by agent-based simulation approach in particular six different workplace strategies that reduce the number of workdays are simulated the results show that for a seasonal influenza r o  14 reducing the number of workdays can effectively reduce the final attack rate eg up to 82 if three consecutive workdays are reduced nevertheless in a pandemic-level influenza r o  20 reducing the number of workdays has significantly less impact ie 3 one extra day off to 21 decrease three extra consecutive days off several other studies present similar results in 23  it is shown that workplace social distancing can reduce the final attack rate by up to 3922 in a r o  14 setting similarly 24 shows that different types of measures can reduce the attack rate from 11 to 20 depending on the frequency of contacts among the employees for school closure measures studies also show positive effects in 25  a modeling technique is employed to examine the effects of four different social distancing measures under three varying r o settings among different types of measures the school closure measure is shown to be able to reduce the final attack rate by 20 10 and 5 and the peak attack rate by 77 47 and 32 in the cases where r o  19 20  r 0  24 and r o  25 respectively similarly it is shown in 26 that prolonged school closure in a pandemic context can reduce the final attack rate by up to 17 and the peak attack rate by up to 45 another common social distancing measures is isolation of the infected cases and cases with similar symptoms in 27  large-scale epidemic simulations are performed to evaluate different strategies for influenza pandemic mitigation among the simulated strategies the results show that the proper implementation such that an isolated individual reduces 90 of its contact rate of isolation can reduce the final attack rate by 7 in a r o  2 setting similarly it is shown in 25 that isolation can reduce the final attack rate by 27 7 and 5 and the peak attack rate by 89 72 and 53 in the cases where r o  19 20  r 0  24 and r o  25 respectively for household quarantines studies have shown that this measure can be effective if the compliance level is sufficient in 27  the effects of voluntary quarantine of household for a duration of 14 days are examined simulations are carried out with the assumption that 50 of households will comply with which leads to a 75 reduction of external contact rates while the internal contact rate will increase by 100 the results show that this measure can reduce the final attack rate by up to 6 and the peak attack rate by up to 40 similarly in 28  simulations are performed to examine the impacts of different measures for household quarantines the result shows that this measure can reduce the final attack rate by 31 and the peak attack rate by 68 with r o  18 and a compliance rate of 50 apart from the abovementioned measures the effectiveness of the other social distancing measures either received limited attention or was often considered in combination with another approach in 27  the effectiveness of travel restrictions and border control measures are examined however the results only show that different levels of travel restrictions from 90 to 999 can delay the peak attack rate by up to six weeks while how travel restrictions affect the attack rate is not examined another type of measures that does not receive much attention is community contact reduction measures eg avoid crowds and mass gatherings cancellation in 25  it is shown that this type of measure can reduce the final attack rate by 17 14 and 10 and the peak attack rate by 72 49 and 38 in the cases where r o  19 20  r o  24 and r o  25 respectively when combined together social distancing measures are proven to be even more effective in various studies 25  27  29  it is shown in 25 that when all four measures ie school closure isolation workplace nonattendance and community contact reduction are in effect they can drastically reduce the attack rates in all the considered r o settings in particular the final attack rate can decrease from 65 to only 3 and the peak attack rate from 474 cases per 10 thousand to only five cases in the highest r o setting similarly 27 examines the effects when household quarantines workplace closures border control and travel restrictions are combined the results show that the final and peak attack rate are three times and six times respectively less than when no policy is implemented moreover the peak attack rate can be delayed by nearly three months in a r o  17 setting in 29  it is also shown that when four types of measures ie school closure household quarantines workplace nonattendance and community contact reduction are in effects the final attack rate can be reduced 3-4 times depending on r o  there are several studies focusing on the negative impacts of social distancing in 30  simulations are performed to evaluate the benefit and cost of different social distancing strategies in this study simulations are carried out without and with social distancing under different caution levels settings simulation results are evaluated based on the benefits of the reduced infection rate and the economic cost of reducing contacts the main finding of this work is that a favorable result can only be obtained by implementing social distancing measures with a high caution level since the economic cost is also considered it is shown that implementing social distancing with an insufficient caution level gives worse results than that of the without social distancing case in 31  a game theoretical approach based on the classic sir model is proposed to evaluate the benefits and costs of social distancing measures interestingly the results show that in the case where r o  1 the equilibrium behaviors include no social distancing measures moreover social distancing measures are shown to achieve the highest economical benefit when r o  2 in the current covid-19 pandemic the world health organization who estimates that the value of r o would be in the range of 2-25 33  as can be seen from the abovementioned studies social distancing measures can play a vital role in mitigating this pandemic with such r o values for example fig 3 illustrates the rolling 3-day average of daily new confirmed covid-19 cases in several countries 32  generally after a country began implementing social distancing eg lockdown in all those countries for 13-23 days the daily number of new cases begins to drop moreover the figure also shows the total number of confirmed cases as can be seen from the second graph the curves representing the total number of cases become less steep after social distancing are implemented ie flattening the curve despite its significant potential ait can be observed that social distancing is very effective only when applied properly nevertheless it is not easy to implement because of many fig 3  real-world effects of social distancing 32  reasons such as the negative economic impacts personal freedom violation and difficulties in changing peoples behaviors thus technologies play a key role in facilitating social distancing which will be reviewed in the next sections 4 practical scenarios the practical social distancing scenarios presented in this survey are illustrated in fig 4 and summarized in table i fig 5  since the main principle of social distancing is to reduce the closeness of human contacts approaches to determine the positions and measure the distance between people can play a vital role in facilitating social distancing measures using ubiquitous technologies such as wi-fi cellular and gps positioning localization systems can thus play a key role in many abovementioned practical social distancing scenarios such as distance keeping public places monitoring contact tracing and automation 1 overview of positioning systems fig 6 illustrates the general process and several popular methods of a positioning system 34  generally a positioning systems main aim is to continuously determine the position of an object in realtime 18  to achieve this goal firstly signals are transmitted from the target to the receiving nodes eg sensors from the received signals useful properties such as arrival time signal direction and signal strength depending on the measurement methods are extracted in the signal measurement phase based on these properties the position of the target can be calculated using various methods in the position calculation phase 34  several effective signal measurements and position calculation methods are presented in the rest of this section 2 signal measurements typical signal measurement methods can be classified based on the extracted property of the received signal among them time-based methods use the arrival time of the signal to determine the distance between the receiving nodes and the target 34  time-based methods can be further classified as follows  time-of-arrival toa 37  this method determines the distance d between the receiving node and the target based on the time it takes for the signal to travel from the target to the node ie enabling technologies for social distancing where c is the speed of the signal transmission and t is the time for the signal to reach the receiving node  time difference-of-arrival tdoa 37  this method uses two kinds of signal with different speeds and calculates d based on the difference between them ie where c 1  c 2  t 1  and t 2 are the speeds and arrival time of the two signals respectively  round trip time rtt 34  the rtt method measures the duration in which the signal travels to the targets and comes back ie where t rt is the time of the whole round trip and t is the predetermined delay between when the target receives the signal and when the target starts sending back a common disadvantage of the toa and tdoa methods is that they require synchronized clocks at the node and the target to determine t t 1 and t 2  which may be costly to implement and requires frequent calibrations to maintain the accuracy although the rtt method does not require clock synchronization it needs to know the delay t which cannot be predicted in many circumstances 35  consequently extra efforts are needed to determine t in advance unlike the time-based methods the angle-of-arrival aoa method determines d by measuring the angle of the incoming signals by using directional antennas or array of antennas the measured angles can then be used in the triangulation method to geometrically determine the target position however a main disadvantage of this method is that it requires extra directional antennas which are costly to implement 34  the received signal strength indicaton rssi method measures the attenuation of the signals to determine the distance typically the relationship between rssi and distance can be formulated as follows 41  where p r is the rssi value at the receiver eg access point d represents the distance from the user device to the access point x is a random variable caused by the shadowing effect which follows the gaussian distribution with zero mean  is a constant value which can be known in advance and depends on fading antennas gain and emitted power of the user device thus based on the rssi level of the received signals the distance between  any two people   detect and monitor

estimate the position of the user device in indoor environments 3 position calculation based on the measured signal properties different methods are employed to calculate the targets position among them trilateration is a common method which uses three reference nodes and the distances between them to the target to calculate the position 34  as illustrated in fig 6  more specifically using the coordinates x 1  y 1  x 2  y 2  x 3  y 3  of the reference nodes and the corre-sponding measured distances d 1  d 2  and d 3  the coordinate x y of the target can be determined by instead of using distances the triangulation method uses the angles of the signal from the aoa method to determine the targets position as illustrated in fig 6  if the coordinates of two references nodes and the corresponding measured angles  1   2 are known the targets position can be geometrically determined 34  to address the uncertainty in measurements the maximum likelihood estimation mle method is often employed this method utilizes the signal measurements from a number of reference nodes usually three or more and apply some statistical approaches such as the minimum variance estimation method 36 to calculate the targets position while minimizing the impact of noises in the environment 34  to enable social distancing many wireless technologies can be adopted such as wi-fi bluetooth rfid zigbee ultra-wideband cellular and gps in this section we first briefly provide the fundamentals of these technologies and then explain how they can enable encourage and enforce people to practice social distancing after that we discuss the potential applications advantages limitations and practical feasibility of these technologies due to the fact that wi-fi technology is widely deployed in indoor environments this technology can be considered to be a promising solution to practice social distancing inside multistory buildings airports alleys parking garages and underground locations where gps and other satellite technologies may not be available or provide low accuracy 38  in a wi-fi system a wireless transmitter known as a wireless access point ap is required to transmit radio signals to communicate with user devices in its coverage area currently wi-fi enabled wireless devices are working on the ieee 80211 standards wi-fi 6 based on 80211ax technology is the newest version of wi-fi standards which provides highthroughput and reliable communications 39  thus wi-fi technology can be adopted to support social distancing in many scenarios 1 crowd detection one potential application of wi-fi technology in social distancing is positioning 41 - 58  based on the location of users the authority can detect crowds inside a building and force them to maintain a safe distance this is an essential factor to practice social distancing during a pandemic outbreak in indoor public places such as train stations and airports there are two main reasons making wi-fi technology possible in social distancing first due to the convenience of hardware facilities we can quickly deploy wi-fi systems for user positioning with very low cost and efforts 40  second with recent advances in wi-fi based indoor positioning wi-fi can provide reliable and precise location services to enable social distancing the most common and easiest way for indoor positioning is calculating the users location based on the rssi of the received signals from the user device 41  42  however the accuracy of this solution much depends on the propagation model thus in 41  the authors present a new method to dynamically estimate the channel model from the user device to the access point the key idea of this solution is continuously determining the rssi values in real-time to obtain the estimated channel model that is close to the real channel model once the propagation is estimated the distance between the access point and the user device can be accurately determined after that the users location will be derived by using the trilateration mechanism differently the authors in 42 propose to adopt the inertial navigation system ins to significantly increase the accuracy of conventional rssi-based methods the key idea of this solution is using a kalman filter to combine and fill the signal database with the ins data as such the authors can obtain the average distance error as small as 06m the above rssi-based solutions can be easily adopted to detect crowds in indoor environments then the local authorities can take appropriate actions to disperse the crowds or suggest other people to not go to the place for example if there are too many people in a supermarket the authorities can notify and recommend new coming customers to go to other supermarkets or come in another time so that they can avoid crowds and practice social distancing 2 crowd detection in dynamic environments although the rssi-based solution can detect the users location with sufficient accuracy they may not be effective to implement in dynamic and complicated indoor environments such as airports or train stations 43  44  45  specifically the geometric approach calculates the user devices position through the geometric relations between the device and the access point although being simple and easy to implement this solution has low accuracy when detecting the users location this is due to the effects of nonline of sight nlos on the wireless signals between the users device and the access point especially in dynamic and complicated environments in which the wireless signals are greatly affected by obstacle shadows caused by activities of people eg running and walking and infrastructures 43  another rssi-based indoor localization technique is the fingerprinting approach or radio map that locates devices based on a previous built database in particular this database contains the signal fingerprints corresponding to several access points in a specific area nevertheless collecting fingerprint data is time-consuming and laborious 46  especially in large areas such as airports or train stations in addition it is infeasible to directly apply the pre-obtained fingerprint database to new areas for localization 47  48  the principle reason is that the adjustment process to apply the fingerprint database of an area to other areas is time-consuming and requires human intervention to address these problems several solutions 43 - 48 are proposed to enable indoor localization in dynamic and complicated areas such as airports and train stations with these solutions the authorities can detect crowds and force people to leave to enable social distancing in pandemic outbreaks specifically in 43  the authors study that when the environment changes eg the presence of people in the line of sight between the user device and the access point the performance of conventional rssi-based localization techniques is greatly decreased thus the authors propose an adaptive signal model fingerprinting algorithm to adapt with the dynamic of environment by detecting users positions and updating the database simultaneously in 47  the authors propose a new localization technique to locate multiple users in different areas by performing a fine-grained localization in addition the authors introduce a transfer mechanism to adjust the fingerprint database over multiple areas to minimize the human intervention differently an interesting design is proposed in 49 to locate and track people by using wi-fi technology namely wi-vi stands for wi-fi vision this technology allows the authorities to track people in indoor environments and detect potential crowds so that they can take appropriate actions to enable social distancing eg notify people to not go to potential crowded places in particular wi-vi uses an mimo interference nulling to remove reflections from static objects and only focuses on moving objects eg a user moreover the authors propose to consider the movement of a user as an antenna array and then track the user by observing its rf beams if there are many people having the same direction eg going to the same place the authorities can notify them to avoid forming crowds thus wi-vi can be considered as a promising technology to enable social distancing 3 public place monitoring and access scheduling another way to apply wi-fi technology in social distancing is controlling the number of people inside a building eg supermarket shopping mall and university specifically with various wi-fi access points implemented inside the building the number of people currently inside the building can be estimated based on the number of connections from user devices to the access points based on this information several actions can be made to practice social distancing such as forcing people to queue before entering the building to maintain a safe number of people inside the facilities at the same time another application is notifying people who want to go to the building specifically based on the number of people inside the building the authority can encourageforce them to stay home or come at a different time if the place is too crowded however the accuracy of this approach depends on many factors such as the number of smart devices one person possesses and how many devices can be connected to a network simultaneously 4 stay-at-home encouragement wi-fi technology can also be used to encourage people to stay at home by detecting the frequency of moving outside their houses for a particular time eg a day specifically when user devices move far away from the access point inside their houses the connection between them will be weak or lost based on this information the access points can estimate the frequency of moving out of their house and then notify the users to encourage them to stay at home as much as possible in summary wi-fi technology is a prominent solution to quickly and effectively enable encourage and force people to practice social distancing with the current advances of wi-fi the accuracy of localization systems can be significantly improved resulting in effective and precise applications for social distancing however wi-fi based technology is mainly used for indoor environments as this technology requires several access points for localization which may not be feasible for outdoor environments for outdoor environments other wireless technologies eg bluetooth gps and cellular technologies can be considered over the past four decades cellular networks have seen tremendous growth throughout four generations making it the primary way of digital communications the fifth generation 5g of cellular networks is coming around 2020 with the first standard according to the cisco mobile traffic forecast there will be more than 13 billion mobile devices connected to the internet by 2023 up from 88 billion mobile devices in 2018 114  that enables deploying the cellular technology to practice social distancing in many circumstances including real-time monitoring people density prediction and encouraging stay-at-home by enabling 5g live broadcasting as illustrated in fig 7  1 real-time monitoring individual tracking and mobility pattern monitoring are potential approaches using the cellular technology to practice social distancing as shown in fig 7a  according to the 3gpp standard the current cellular networks ie lte and lte-a are employing various localization methods such as assisted-gnss a-gnss enhanced cell-id e-cid and observed tdoa o-tdoa as specified in the release 9 uplink-tdoa u-tdoa included in the release 11 and with the aids of other technologies like wi-fi bluetooth and terrestrial beacon system tbs as stated in the release 13 115  116  cellphone location data collected by the current cellular network is normally used for network operations and managers 116 such as network planning and optimization to enhance the quality of service qos rather than user applications due to the low accuracy and resource consumption however in the context of social distancing user tracking based on data of user movement history can be considered to be an effective approach for quarantined people detection and infected people tracing for instance the authorities can check whether infected people are violating the quarantine requirements or not in cases if they do not follow the requirements the authorities can send warning messages or even perform some aggressive measures eg fines and arrests to force them self-isolation moreover when a user has been exposed to the virus the users mobility history can be extracted to investigate the spread of the virus in these cases the cellular technology can outperform other wireless technologies in term of availability and popularity for example localization services relying on wireless technologies such as gps that always need to be run in the foreground application ie the availability while this service is a part of cellular network operations in addition ultra-wideband and zigbee technologies require additional hardware 86  103 ie the popularity incoming 5g networks with the presence of key technologies such as mm-wave communications d2d communications and ultra-dense networks udns 117 are capable of performing a high precision localization two positioning schemes exploiting the mm-wave communications are proposed in 118 based on validation of triangulation measurements and angle of differences of arrival adoa the authors in 119 proposed a positioning scheme in udns using a cascaded extended kalman filter ekf structure to fuse the doa and toa estimations from the reference nodes the proposed scheme can localize a moving target at speed 50 kmh with a sub-meter level accuracy it can be used for tracking vehicles and monitoring the traffic density recently some governments have required the telecom companies to share cellphone location data to implement social distancing to deal with covid-19 for instance taiwan deployed an electronic fence exploiting the cellular-based triangulation methods to track who are quarantined stay in their homes 120  the local officials call them twice a day to ensure they do not leave their phones at home and visit them within 15 minutes after their phones are turned off or they move away from their home moscow government is also said to be planning to use sim card data for tracking foreigners and residents who have close contacts with foreigners when the border closure order is lifted 121  however individual tracking using the cellular technology has risen concerns about privacy 122  123  instead groupcrowd detecting and monitoring based on shared location data which is anonymous and aggregated from carriers become the key approach utilized by several governments such as italy germany austria the uk korea and australia 124 - 127  this approach is intended to alleviate privacy concerns compared with individual-level tracking ie it satisfies the eu privacy rules 123  the metadata can be used to obtain the mobility patterns thus the governments can monitor whether people are complying with the lock-down rules or not it can be also employed to model the spread of the virus to aid the governments to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of quarantine measures during the outbreak 2 people density prediction in addition to the real-time crowd monitoring and modeling the spread of the virus the movement historical data can be utilized to predict the network traffic thanks to the large-scale location data provided by carriers and the recent advances of machine learning there are many research works on network traffic prediction proposed in 128 - 132 based on the history of users movements furthermore the number of users in a specific area can be also estimated from the network traffic of that area as illustrated in fig 7b  thus the authorities can predict the crowd gathering in public places eg shopping malls airports and train stations relying on the corresponding forecasted network traffic then appropriate actions can be performed by the authorities to prevent crowd gathering in these places for example if the predicted number of people entering a shopping mall exceeds a threshold the authorities can notify customers to avoid coming to this place at this time or recommend them to go to other shopping malls having lower densities in addition this method can be also applied in residential areas to study how often people stay home as well as predict when they go out or the places they come to this can provide significant data input for network traffic forecast in public places in addition if they regularly go to necessary places the authorities can warn or force them to stay at home as much as possible 3 stay-at-home encouragement to implement social distancing many people must do their daily activities remotely from their home such as working studying and entertainment therefore some video conference applications used to work from home or study online have witnessed an explosion of downloads for example the zoom application has achieved an increase by 1270 from 22 feb to 22 mar in 2020 133 and the number of newly registered users of microsoft teams has also risen 775 monthly in italy after the full lockdown was started 134  as a result 5g live broadcasting technology can be used to encourage people to stay at home as much as possible without any impacts on their work or study  fig 7c  there are many works to enhance the quality of video multicastbroadcast applications by utilizing the advances of 5g networks 135 - 139  video multicastbroadcast services are defined as an ultra high definition slice in an mimo system 135  to improve the spectrum efficiency for video multicastbroadcast in the proposed system the authors introduce a hybrid digital-analog scheme to tackle channel condition and antenna heterogeneity another possible solution that can significantly improve qualities for video multicastingbroadcasting is data caching a novel caching paradigm proposed in 136 is applied for multicast services in heterogeneous networks with the awareness of multicast files the proposed caching policy can select files efficiently for the caches studies in 137  138 propose using noma techniques to support multicastbroadcast by increasing the spectrum efficiency in multi-user environments finally the authors in 139 propose a video multicast orchestration scheme for 5g udns which can help to improve the spectrum efficiency 4 infected movement data due to the omnipresence of mobile phones and the near world-wide coverage of cellular signals cellular technology can be an effective tool to track the movement of people unlike in the quarantined people detection scenarios where these people may deliberately leave their phone at home people do not have any reason to do so in the infected movement data scenario therefore cellular can be an effective technology in this scenario the authors of 257 summarized the methods to trace human position in outdoor environment using base stations and indoor environment using access points however the accuracy of the outdoor environment still needs to improved because small errors of cellular network would lead to bigger errors in the distance measurement given aforementioned studies cellular technology can be considered to be one of most important approaches to assist social distancing it can be deployed on a large scale due to its convenience and ubiquitousness compared to other wireless technologies it can be used to track quarantined or infected individuals furthermore it can provide a unique solution to not only monitor crowds in real time but also allow the local authorities to predict the forming of crowds in public areas eg airports train stations and shopping malls based on the forecasted network traffic however the use of subscribers location data for social distancing measures has can cause privacy concerns which will be discussed more details in section v in addition 5g live broadcasting support can be used to encourage people to stay at home during pandemic with the explosive growth of bluetooth-enabled devices bluetooth technology is another solution for social distancing in both indoor and outdoor environments in particular bluetooth is a wireless technology used for short-range wireless communications in the range from 24 to 2485 ghz 59  60  bluetooth devices can automatically detect and connect to other devices nearby forming a kind of adhoc called piconet 60  recently bluetooth low energy ble has been introduced as an extended version of the classic bluetooth to reduce the energy usage of devices and improve the communication performance 60  given above the ble localization technology possesses several advantages compared with those of the wi-fi localization first the ble signals have a higher sample rate than that of the wi-fi signals ie 025 hz  2 hz 61  second the ble technology consumes less power than that of the wi-fi technology and thus can be implemented widely in handheld devices third the ble signals can be obtained from most smart devices while wi-fi signals can be obtained from only access points finally ble beacons are usually powered by battery and thereby they are more flexible and easier to deploy than wi-fi 1 contact tracing one application of bluetooth in social distancing is contact tracing 62  63 as illustrated in fig 8  the key idea is using bluetooth to detect other users in close proximity with their information eg identifier stored in a persons bluetooth device eg a mobile phone when there is an infected case the authorities can ask people to share these records as a part of a contact tracing investigation thereby the authorities can detect people who may have close contact with the infected one and notify them promptly to prevent the spreading of diseases several attempts to use bluetooth in contact tracing have been reported apple and google have recently introduced an mobile application running on both iphone and android devices that can detect other smartphones nearby by using bluetooth technology 64  65  if a person is tested positive for a disease heshe will enter the result in the app to inform others about that then people who may have close contact with the positive case will be notified and instructed about what to do next similar apps have 2 crowd detection bluetooth technology can be used to detect crowds in indoor environments to practice social distancing with the latest advances in bluetooth localization techniques 70  72  in particular based on signals received from users bluetooth devices a central controller can calculate the positions of users and detectpredict crowds in indoor environments if a crowd is detected the local manager can force people to leave to practice social distancing in addition they can advice people who want to go to the place to come at different time if the place is too crowed at the moment in 70  the authors point out that with the development of bluetooth low energy bluetooth-based indoor localization can be considered as a practical method to locate bluetooth devices in indoor environments due to its low battery cost and high communication performance the authors then propose indoor localization schemes that collect rssi measurements to detect the users location by using the triangulation mechanism in 71  the authors show that the ble technology is strongly affected by the fast fading interference resulting in a low accuracy when detecting the users device to improve the accuracy of the ble positioning the authors run several experimental tests to choose the optimal parameters to set up ble localization systems the authors demonstrate that the ble-based indoor localization can achieve a better performance than that of wi-fi localization system the authors in 73 point out that the accuracy of ble-based localization is strongly affected by advertising channels human movements and human obstacles to address these problems they propose a dynamic ai model that can detect human obstacles on the channel by using three ble advertising channels then the rssi values will be compensated accordingly the experimental results then demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of the rssi-ranges and the localization accuracy 3 distance between two people another application of bluetooth in social distancing is determining the distance between two persons by using their bluetooth-enabled devices eg smartphone or smartwatch as shown in fig 9  specifically similar to the wi-fi technology based on rssi levels a device can calculate the distances between it and other nearby devices 72  it is worth noting that the bluetooth technology can allow a device to connect to multiple devices at the same time 59  thus the device can simultaneously detect distances to multiple devices in its area if the distance is too small eg less than 15 meters 74 the devices can notify the users to warn and encourage them to practice social distancing given the above bluetooth technology is a very promising solution to enable social distancing however the privacy of users needs to be taken into account as the applications require users to share information with the authorities and third parties as such this can be a research direction to ensure the privacy and encourage people to share their information to prevent the spreading of diseases in addition several drawbacks of bluetooth technology in social distancing which need to be considered such as the accuracy of localization techniques when the users devices are located inside the pockets or bags and their devices always need to turn on the bluetooth mode furthermore combining bluetooth and other technologies eg wi-fi 75  to improve the localization accuracy is also an open research direction ultra-wideband uwb technology has been deemed to be a promising candidate for precise indoor positioning systems ipss that can sustain an accuracy at the centimeter level in the ranges from short to medium due to its unique characteristics eg high time-domain resolution immunity of multipath low-cost implementation low power consumption and good penetration 99  due to the wide bandwidth nature of uwb signals at least 500 mhz as specified by fcc 100  the impulse radio ir uwb technology has the capability of generating a series of very short duration gaussian pulses in time domain which enables its advantages compared with other rf technology pulse position modulation with time hopping th-ppm is the most popular modulation scheme exploited in the impulse radio based uwb 101  this pulse can directly propagate in the radio channel without the need of an additional carrier modulation the basebandlike architecture of the ir-uwb facilitates extremely simple and low-power transmitters thus the advantages of the ir-uwb technology can greatly support social distancing even better than other wireless technologies eg higher accuracy in indoor positioning applications or provide exclusive solutions eg device-free trackingcounting for some scenarios as discussed below 1 real-time monitoring in this section we review some social distancing scenarios using ultra-wideband technology for real-time monitoring such as crowd detection eg tracking users location public place monitoring and access scheduling eg counting the number of people in a specific area a crowd detection one of the major solutions for crowd detection is tracking locations of people in public areas there are many commercial products exploiting the ir-uwb technology for real-time localization in both daily life and factories such as decawave 102  bespoon 103  zebra 104  ubisense 105  decawave and bespoon claim their products based on ranging measurements can offer an accuracy under 10 cm 102  103  furthermore ubisense and zebra provide industrial products which can obtain the high accuracy even in cluttered indoor factory environments 104  105  all of them support real-time positioning for multiple mobile tags by using the triangulation techniques based on the absolute locations of reference nodes or anchors eg uwb transceivers especially the dimension4 sensor invented by ubisense can be integrated with a built-in gps module for outdoor tracking purposes experiments conducted to evaluate holistically the performance of three commercial products ie decawave bespoon and ubisense under indoor industrial environment setting with the presence of nlos can be found in 106  the availability of commercial uwb-based localization systems enables real-time people tracking in public places by localizing their uwb-supported phones or personal belongings equipped with tags eg keys and shoes thus the authorities can detect the crowd to notify them and other people in the area disperse the crowd or even predict and prevent the forming of the crowd by using aideep learning algorithms based on the previously collected data recently device-free localization or passive positioning techniques have witnessed a significant increase of interests since it can tackle problems of communication-based localization approaches mentioned above which are i privacy issues eg tracking targets do not need to communicate with an access pointnetwork coordinator thus it can protect private information of the target and ii physical obstacles eg los communications have significant influence by obstacles 107  the high time-domain resolution feature of the ir-uwb technology enables the device-free localization methods relying on the changes of very short pulses properties between two transceivers because of absorption scattering diffraction reflection and refraction 108  109  in particular the authors in 108 use monostatic radar modules ie p410 platform equipped with one transmitter and one receiver for multi-target tracking based on gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density gm-phd filters information including raw signal bandpass signal motion filtered signal and detection list extracted from the reflected signals is used to estimate the locations of targets with an accuracy at the decimeter level to improve the accuracy a multi-static is deployed in 109 to track a person in real time by determining the difference between the newly channel impulse response with the presence of a new object with that of the previous one without the object the location of the object can be found with the mean error of only 3 cm by applying a leading edge detection algorithm on the difference of the two measurements however the limitation of this work is that it can track only one target at a time motivated by the above works we can easily deploy device-free localization techniques for crowd detection in public areas such as airports train stations and shopping malls without revealing any personal information and hardware requirements on target objects thereby the authorities can locate exact locations of crowds and have appropriate actions to disperse crowds or force them to practice social distancing b public place monitoring and access scheduling a simple solution for public place monitoring is referred to as device or tag-free counting techniques 110  111  specifically the authors in 110 propose an advanced people counting algorithm with less computation based on the revelation of the received signal pattern according to the number of people illustrated in fig 10a  this method enables people counting even with the presence of dense multipath signals in the environment which is not able to be performed by counting techniques based on detecting single signals corresponding to individual persons for example other counting approaches using wi-fi and zigbee rely on the number of connections from users to an access points ie wi-fi or a network coordinator ie zigbee major clusters are picked up to find main pulses having maximum amplitude a joint probability density function derived from these main pulses is utilized to derive maximum likelihood ml equation then the estimated number of people is determined to be the figure having the maximum likelihood as shown in fig 10b  similarly the solution in 111 also provides a counting approach without positioning targets by using the crowd-centric method based on energy detection without the need of hardware deployment on counting objects like wi-fi and zigbee the approaches proposed in 110  111 can provide a low-cost and highprivacy solution to detect the number of people in public areas eg shopping malls airports train stations and offices further actions can be conducted by the local manager to maintain social distancing such as scheduling people to enter the place based on the counting information or giving advice to other people who are planning to go to the crowded place to come at a different time 2 keeping distance and contact tracing maintaining distance between two people and between a person and crowd is an important measure that individuals can do to practice social distancing moreover close physical contact tracing based on information of the aforementioned solutions can be also implemented when there is a new infected person we will discuss all these solutions in the following sections a keeping distance and contact tracing similar to bluetooth the ir-uwb technology can also be applied to maintain the distances between people as well as close physical contact tracing by using ranging methods with high precision in both indoor and outdoor environments 102  112  while decawave provides a ranging measurement using sensors and tags 102  apple has already brought this feature to their phones eg iphone 11 series for their primitive location-based services eg finding objects and improving airdrop 112  these approaches use time-based ranging techniques like tof tdoa or combined tof and aoa to measure the distances to nearby sensors tags or phones however these products can be employed to detect close proximity between users in public places thanks to the ir-uwb technology they can frequently broadcast pilot messages containing some information eg their specific ids timestamp etc to nearby devices for ranging measurements with extremely low energy consumption then surrounding devices can utilize the information of the received messages to estimate the distance from the source device and warn the users if they are too close to each other eg less than 15m in a pandemic situation 12  in addition these devices can also store other information like who had close contacts with them along with the distances and duration periods this information is very important because it can be used to trace close contacts in the future eg investigate the spread of the virus in a pandemic with minimal privacy violation b distance tofrom crowds in order to help people to avoid crowds especially vulnerable or at-risk groups in indoor environments such as shopping malls hospitals and office buildings bespoon introduces a commercial product that allows moving targets to self-localize their positions very accurately ie less than 10 cm over 600 m in los environments in a short time by using the ir-uwb technology 103  this product provides both evaluation kits and an ultra-compact uwb module which can be easily integrated into off-the-shelf products eg shopping trolleys or baskets for localization and navigation purposes a snaploc platform proposed in 113 allows an unlimited number of tags to self estimate their locations at position update rates up to 23 khz it uses the tdoa technique based on all simultaneous responded information from reference nodes integrated into one single channel impulse response by combining with the positioning service ie to provide locations of other people in a specific area a navigation application exploiting commercial products like bespoon can be developed to assist people eg customers for self-detecting their current locations as well as crowds locations along the way thereby assisting them to plan their moves and navigate to stay away from crowds to summarize with the aforementioned potential applications the ir-uwb systems can be considered to be an outstanding solution to handle social distancing in both indoor and outdoor environments the ir-uwb based localization systems discussed in 102 - 105 can be employed for detecting and monitoring crowds in public places with a lowcost deployment although this technology can also be used to monitor the positions of self-isolated people to check whether they break the quarantine requirements or not it has less attractive than other rf technologies like wi-fi or cellular which do not require to install additional hardware for tracking purposes in addition uwb-enabled phones like iphone 11 series can assist users in practicing social distancing without localization and navigation services however this solution is only working for modern iphone equipped with the uwb chip last but not least the device-free technology presented in 108 - 111 is a great advantage of the ir-uwb technology compared with other wireless technologies for the crowd detecting and monitoring in public places with acceptable accuracy at the decimeter level 108  the gnss global navigation satellite systems originally developed the us department of defense global positioning system gps has been being the most widely used for positioning purposes in the outdoor environment nowadaysgnss satellites orbit the earth and continuously broadcast navigation messages when a receiver receives the navigation messages from the satellites it can calculate the distances from its location to the satellites based on the transmitting time in the messages basically to calculate the current location of a user it requires at least three different navigation messages from three different satellites based on the trilateration mechanism presented in section ii however in practice to achieve a high accuracy in calculating the location of a user at least four different messages from four satellites are required the fourth one is to address the time synchronization problem at the receiver 140  currently some gnss systems eg galileo can achieve the accuracy less than 1m 147  as a result gnss systems can be considered to be a very promising solution to practice social distancing 1 applications for real-time monitoring and automation due to outstanding features of gnss technology in locating people especially in outdoor environments this technology is very useful for tracking people to practice social distancing specifically most of smart phones now are equipped with gps devices which can be used to track locations of mobile users when needed in the context of a pandemic outbreak eg covid-19 many suspects for example returning from an infected area will be required to be self-isolated thus to monitor these people the authorities can ask them to wear gps-based positioning devices to make sure that they do not leave their residences during the quarantine 161  162  the main advantage of using gnss technology compared to wi-fi or infrared-based solutions for people tracking is that this technology allows to monitor people anywhere and anytime globally and thus even the suspects move from one city to another city the authorities still can track and monitor them however one of the major disadvantages of this technology is that it much depends on the satellite signals thus in some areas with weak or high interference signals eg inside a building or in crowed areas the location accuracy is very low 151  160  163  another useful application of gnss to practice social distancing is automation it comes from the fact that gnss is especially important for navigation in autonomous systems such as robots uavs and self-driving cars thus in a pandemic outbreak when people are required to stay at home gnss-based autonomous services play a key role to minimize physical contact between people for example customers can shop online and receive their items with drone delivery services such kind of services have been introduced recently by some large retail corporations such as amazon and dhl similarly robotaxi services have been introduced recently in some countries to deal with covid-19 outbreak 159  166  it can be clearly seen that these gnss-based autonomous services can contribute a significant part in implementing social distancing in practice by minimizing workforce for delivery and transportation gnss technology a very well known technology in navigation with a lot of applications in civil and military can provide many useful applications to practice social distancing eg people tracking distance keeping and autonomous services however there are some concerns related to privacy and accuracy of using gnss technology for the privacy issues they will be discussed in section v with several solutions such as location information protection and personal identity protection for the accuracy issues some recent advanced gnss technologies can be used such as real-time kinematic which can provide an accuracy of less than a centimeter however the implement cost for such services is still very high which needs to be further investigated 2 keeping distance and crowd detection in 155  the authors introduce a gnss service which can be used to determine the locations of users thereby can warn them if they violate the social distancing requirements in particular in this service mobile users are required to install a mobile application which can track the location of the users based on gps technology then the users locations will be updated constantly to the service provider thus based on the users locations the service provider can determine whether the user violates the social distancing requirements or not for example if there are more than two users locating too close to each other eg less than two meters the service provider can send warning messages to remind the users furthermore in the cases if a user goes to restricted areas eg isolated areas they will receive warning messages to be aware of using protection measures 3 infected movement data in the infected movement data scenario gnss can be a very effective technology because of its world-wide coverage and positioning accuracy is not a main concern for outdoor environment using gnss alone can be sufficient for tracking the location of infected people with the omnipresence of smartphones with built-in gps feature the movement path of the infected people can be easily determined however a main concern in this scenario is that people have to turn on gps service on their smartphones which necessitate mechanisms to incentivize people to share their movement information this issue will be further discussed in section v although this gnss-based service has many advantages in practicing social distancing eg tracking users keeping distance and group monitoring it has some shortcomings which limit its applications in practice specifically this service requires tracking locations of users based on gps in a realtime manner which may cause some extra-implementation costs and privacy issues for users furthermore in terms of determining the distance between two people the accuracy of gnss services is not high in general especially for distances less than two meters thus some recent advanced gnss technologies like 143  149  150 can be user to improve the accuracy however these technologies are still very expensive and have not been widely deployed for public services and thus more research in this direction can be further explored zigbee is also a potential technology that can help to enable social distancing in particular zigbee is a standard-based wireless communication technology for low-cost and lowpower wireless networks such as iot networks and wireless sensor networks a zigbee system consists of a central hub eg network coordinator and zigbee-enabled devices zigbeeenabled devices can communicate with each other at the range of up to 65 feet  20 meters with an unlimited number of hops compared with wi-fi and bluetooth technologies zigbee is designed to be cheaper and simpler making it possible for low-cost and low-power communications for smart devices 84  85  moreover zigbee can operate at several frequencies such as 24 ghz 868 mhz and 915 mhz given the above zigbee is ideal for constructing mesh networks with long battery life and reliable communications 85  as a result zigbee can be considered as a promising candidate in several applications that enable social distancing during a pandemic outbreak 1 crowd detection one promising application of zigbee is detecting and tracking users location in indoor environments the key idea is that based on the rssi level of the received signals from the users zigbee-enabled device the zigbee control hub can determine the location of the user several research works report that zigbee localization systems can achieve high accuracy with low-power and low-cost devices 84  based on the location of users the central hub can detect crowds ie many users at the same area and notify the local manager to ask people to practice social distancing during a pandemic outbreak with the state-of-the-art mechanisms in the literature the accuracy of zigbee localization systems is significantly improved making it feasible for social distancing in 86  the authors propose a novel framework to enhance the localization accuracy of zigbee devices by considering the effect of drift phenomenon when users move from a place to other places in indoor environments the authors then demonstrate that the proposed framework can increase the accuracy by up to 60 compared with conventional solutions differently in 87  the authors introduce an ensemble mechanism to further improve the localization accuracy in particular instead of using the rssi level the proposed solution combines the gradient-based search the linear least square approximation and multidimensional scaling methods together with spatial dependent weights of the environment to approximate the targets location in 88  the authors propose an energy-efficient indoor localization system that can obtain wi-fi fingerprints by using zigbee interference signatures the key idea of this work is using zigbee interfaces to detect wi-fi access points which can significantly save energy compared with using wi-fi interfaces furthermore a k-nearest neighbor method with the manhattan distance is introduced to increase the accuracy of the localization system the experimental results show that the proposed solution can save 68 of energy compared with the method using wi-fi interfaces the accuracy is also improved by 87 compared to state-of-the-art wifi fingerprint-based approaches 2 public place monitoring and access scheduling in a zigbee system there is a central hub known as the network coordinator to control other connected devices in the network thus zigbee can be used to control the number of people in indoor environments eg hospitals supermarkets and shopping malls specifically when a person equipped with a zigbee-enabled device eg id card or member card enters the place the device will connect to the zigbee central hub as such the central hub is able to calculate the total number of people inside the place at a given time based on this information the local manager can ask people to queue before entering the place if it is too crowded in summary zigbee technology can play an important role in enabling social distancing during pandemic outbreaks however similar to rfid technology zigbee is a new technology and has not been widely adopted in our daily life and thus limiting its practical applications nevertheless with the support from leading companies such as amazon google apple and texas instruments 85  the number of zigbee-enable devices is expected to explosively increase in the near future furthermore combining zigbee with other technologies eg wi-fi 88  is also a promising research direction to improve the performance of localization systems in terms of the accuracy and robustness radio frequency identification rfid plays a key role in real-time object localizing and tracking 76  thus rfid technology is also a potential solution for social distancing an rfid localization system usually consists of three main components i rfid readers ii rfid tags and iii a data processing system 77  typically rfid tags can be categorized into two types i active tags and ii passive tags a passive rfid tag can operate without requiring any power source and it is powered by the electromagnetic field generated by the rfid reader in contrast an active rfid tag has its own power source eg a battery and continuously broadcasts its own signals active rfid tags are usually used in localization systems thus rfid technology can be considered as a potential technology to practice social distancing 1 crowd detection one potential application of rfid technology is locating users in indoor environments based on recent rfid-based localization solutions 76 - 80  to that end each user is equipped with an rfid tag eg the staff id or member cards based on the backscattered signals from the rfid tag the rfid reader can determine the location of the user if there are too many people in the same area the system can notify the authorities to take appropriate actions eg force people to leave the area to practice social distancing several recent mechanisms in the literature can be adopted to make this application possible during pandemic outbreaks in 78  the authors propose an rfid-based localization system for indoor environments with high localization granularity and accuracy the key idea of this solution is reducing the rssi shifts localization error and computational complexity by using heron-bilateration estimation and kalman-filter drift removal in 79  the authors propose to use a moving robot to enhance the accuracy of a real-time rfid-based localization system in particular the robot is able to perform simultaneous localization and mapping slam and thus it can continuously interrogate all rfid tags in its area then based on passive rfid tags at known locations we can estimate the location of target tags by properly manipulating the measured backscattered power alternatively in 76  the authors propose to equipped two rfid tags at the target instead of only one as in conventional solutions to improve the accuracy of localization techniques adding one more rfid tag possesses several advantages i easy to implement and adjust the rfid readers antenna ii enabling fine-grained calculation and iii enabling accurate calibration the experimental results then show that equipping two tags at the user can greatly increase the localization accuracy of the system however the rfid technology has several limitations due to the fact that both the receiver and the rf source are in the rfid reader specifically the modulated signals backsacttered from the rfid tag are strongly affected by the round-trip path loss from the receiver and the rf source in addition the rfid system can also be affected by the doubly near-far problem 81  to address these problems a few recent works propose to use bistatic and ambient backscatter communication technologies extended version of rfid for localization 82  83  the key idea is separating the rf source from the receiver the rf source now can be a dedicated carrier emitter or an ambient rf source the tag then can transmit data to the receiver by backscattering the rf signals generated by the rf source based on the received signals the receiver can estimate the location of the tag in 83  the authors propose a localization system based on backscatter communications to locate patients in a hospital in particular each patient is equipped with a backscatter tag which can backscatter signals broadcast by an rf source then the location of a patient can be detected by a localization algorithm namely remix based on the backscattered signals from the backscatter tags remix consists of two processes first the algorithm approximates the distance from the tag to the receiver based on the backscattered signals second the signal paths are modeled with linear splines then an optimization problem is solved to find the effective distances corresponding to the paths that close to the actual paths from the tag to the receiver as a result remix can accurately estimate the position of the backscatter tag by modeling the spline structure based on the users locations remix can detect crowds in the hospital and advice the authorities to take appropriate actions to practice social distancing note that this solution can also be deployed to detect crowds in other places such as workplaces schools and supermarkets where backscatter tags can be easily attached to userscustomers cards eg staff cards student cards and member cards 2 public place monitoring and access scheduling another application of rfid in social distancing is monitoring the number of people inside a place eg a building or supermarket in particular an rfid reader will be deployed at the main gate of a place and users are equipped with rfid tags can be both active and passive tags the users tags can broadcast their id active or send their id upon receiving rf signals from the rfid reader passive when a user enters the place the rfid reader can receive the users id and increase the counter as such the rfid reader can calculate the number of people inside the place if there are too many people the system can notify the local manager to force people to queue before entering the place to practice social distancing this solution can be deployed in supermarkets or workplaces where the customerstaff usually have memberstaff id cards which can be equipped with rfid tags in summary rfid technology is a potential solution to enable social distancing however different from other wireless technologies rfid technology has not been widely adopted in practice due to its complexity in implementation specifically to be able to detect the location of people by using rfid technology they need to be equipped with rfid tags however rfid tags are not readily available likes wi-fi access points or bluetooth thus applications of rfid technology for social distancing are still limited in practice table ii summarizes the technologies discussed in this section in addition to the wireless technologies other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence computer vision ultrasound inertial sensors visible lights and thermal also can all contribute to facilitating social distancing in this section we provide a brief overview of each technology and discuss how it can be applied for different social distancing scenarios over the last 10 years we have witnessed numerous applications of artificial intelligence ai in many aspects of our lives such as healthcare automotive economics and computer networks 296  the outstanding features of ai technologies are the abilities to automatically learn useful information from the obtained data this leads to more intelligent automation operating cost reduction as well as the great compatibility to adapt with changing environments for that ai and its underlying machine learning algorithms can also play a key role in social distancing especially in the modern lives with many practical applications as discussed below 1 distance tofrom crowds and contact tracing applications of machine learning to users location data allow us to effectively monitor the distance between people and trace the close contacts of infected people in 341  the authors analyze the accuracy of a users location prediction based on hisher friends location datasets in this case a temporalspatial bayesian model is developed to select influential friends considering their influence levels to the user thus the service provider can predict the exact location of a mobile user by using the temporal-spatial bayesian model then when the user is too close to other mobile userspeople at crowded public places or hisher friends when they go in a group as illustrated in fig 11a  hisher smartphone can alert to keep a safe distance in addition using the list of influential friends based on their ranks the service provider can utilize it for the contact tracing purpose when the mobile user or one of hisher influential friends in the list gets infected 2 infected movement prediction another application of machine learning is to predict infected people movement from one location to another one and hence can potentially predict the geographic movement of the disease the prediction is particularly crucial as infected people may travel to various wi-fi 38  39  41  43  47  93 depend on the router antenna and modulation technique typically up to 50m indoors and 100m outdoors 89 1m -5m 42 low low high indoor mobile phones smart home smart city 54  93 cellular 128  129  132  135  139 short to long less than 50cm   mobile phones 342  344  361  intelligent transportation systems 323  324 rfid 76  78  80  93 active 100m or more passive  10m 91 less than 1m 78 high low medium indoor mobile phones smart home smart city 94  95 places and can accidentally infect others before know that they carry the disease in 342  the authors introduce a smartphonebased location recognition and prediction model to detect current location and predict the destination of mobile users in particular the location recognition is implemented using the combination of k-nearest neighbor and decision tree learning algorithms while the destination prediction is realized using hidden markov models given the history of infected people movement we can adopt the above model to recognize and predict the potential geographic movement of the disease using the information people can be advised to stay away from the possible infected locations through alerts from their smartphones as illustrated in fig 11b  the current location prediction of quarantined people eg infected people and at-risk people eg sick and old people is very important to monitor whether they currently stay at the selfquarantined and self-protection areas eg their homes or not to this end machine learning-based location prediction approach can help to detect the current position of those people in a certain area in 343  the authors apply the auto-encoder neural networks and one-class support vector machines to verify whether a user is within a specific area or not considering various channel models ie path-loss shadowing and fading the proposed solutions can achieve neyman-pearson optimal performance by observing the probability of missdetections and false-alarms the authors in 344 propose a novel localization system leveraging a federated learning to allow mobile users to collaboratively provide accurate location services without revealing mobile users private location as such the authors utilize deep neural networks with the gaussian process to accurately predict the desired location of the mobile users as a result we can apply the proposed solutions to detect if infected people or at-risk people currently move away from their homes as illustrated in fig 11c  moreover we can utilize the proposed solutions to determine the movement frequency of the self-isolated people outside the protection facility using the movement frequency history the authorities can enforce them to stay at the protection facility for further infection prevention predicting the density of people or the number of people in public places allows us to efficiently schedule or guide people to stay away or refrain from coming to soon-to-be over-crowded places for example when the predicted number of people in a certain place almost reaches a pre-defined threshold eg according to the social distancing requirement the service provider can broadcast a local notification to incoming people via cellular network aiming at encouraging them move to other less density areas in 345  the authors adopt advanced machine learning-based approaches for edge networks to predict the number of mobile users within base stations coverages particularly the framework first groups the base stations into clusters according to their network data and deployment loca- fig 11  application of artificial intelligence to social distancing tions then using various machine learning algorithms eg the bayesian ridge regressor the gaussian process regressor and the random forest regressor we can predict the number of mobile users within their network coverages from the preceding architecture one can utilize wi-fi hotspots and cluster them based on their locations by doing so we can predict the number of people within each clusters coverage using the same architecture we can extend the application to predict the traffic level on the roads specifically upon predicting the number of vehicular users on the roads we guide the drivers to choose particular routes to satisfy the social distancing requriements eg suggest alternative routes to avoid crowded areas in 346  the authors introduce a uav-enabled intelligent transportation system to predict road traffic conditions using the combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks in particular sensor cameras on the uavs are utilized to capture the current road traffic by using this information the uavs can then predict the road traffic conditions using the aforementioned deep learning methods thus from the traffic prediction the uavs can work as mobile road side units to orchestrate road traffic for over-crowding avoidance through informing the upcoming road traffic conditions to vehicular users via cellular networks accordingly fig 11d  machine learning-based location prediction method is also of importance to predict the sickness trend in specific areas this sickness trend prediction can be used to inform people stay safe from possible infected places for example the work in 347 designs a contactless surveillance framework ie flusense to predict the influenzalike disease 7-14 days before the real disease occurs in the hospital waiting areas in particular a set of real-time sensors including a microphone array to detect normal speechcough sounds and a thermal camera to detect crowd density are embedded into an edge computing platform considering millions of non-speech audio samples and hundred thousands of thermal images for audio and image recognition models the proposed framework can accurately predict the number of daily influenza-like patients with pearson correlation coefficient of 095 the prediction model from this work can be correlatedcombined with the localized medicalhealth information eg from local hospitalsclinics to further improve the prediction accuracy as shown in fig 11 e we then can inform the local mobile users about the sickness trend prediction to avoid the potential areas where many influenzalike patients exist  computer vision technology trains computers to interpret and understand visual data such as digital images or videos thanks to recent breakthroughs in ai eg in pattern recognition and deep learning computer vision has enabled computers to accurately identify and classify objects 167  such capabilities can play an important role in enabling encouraging and enforcing social distancing for example computer vision can turn surveillance cameras into smart cameras which can not only monitor people but also can detect recognize and identify whether people comply with social distancing requirements or not in this section we discuss several social distancing scenarios where computer vision technology can be leveraged including public place monitoring and highrisk people quarantined people and people with symptoms monitoring and detection 1 public place monitoring despite government restrictions and recommendations about social gathering some people still do not comply with which can cause the virus infection to the community in such context human detection features in object detection 168  a major sub-field of computer vision can help to detect crowds in public areas through realtime images from surveillance cameras an example scenario is described in fig 12a  if the number of people in an area does not meet the social distancing requirement eg gathering above 10 people the authorities can be notified to take appropriate actions there are two main approaches to detect humans from images in object detection namely region-based and unifiedbased techniques the former detects humans from images in two stages including the region proposal and the procession according to the regions 169  based on this approach several frameworks including fast-rcnn 175 and faster-rcnn 176 are developed in combination with convolution neural network cnn 173  in 177  the authors improve the faster-rcnn by proposing the mask regions with cnn features mask rcnn method which masks the bounding box to detect the object with high accuracy while adding a minor overhead to the faster-rcnn mask rcnn outperforms previous methods by simplifying the training process and improving the accuracy in detecting humans in the images for calculating the density of people in a particular area although the above region-based approach has high recognition accuracy 177  it has high complexity which is unsuitable for devices with limited computational capacity to address this the unified approach is a suitable which can reduce the computational complexity by detecting humans from images with only one step this approach maps the pixels from image to the bounding box grid and class probabilities to detect humans or objects in real-time following this direction the you only look once yolo method proposed in 178 can detectpredict objects even small ones in real-time with high accuracy in addition in 179  the authors propose the single shot multibox detector ssd framework which uses a convolution network on the image to calculate a feature map and then predict the bounding box through experimental results they demonstrate that this method can detect objects faster and more accurately than those of both yolo and faster-rcnn for public place monitoring both yolo 178 and ssd 179 can be used to detect fast and accurately humans from real-time images or videos of surveillance cameras after identifying people we can use a real-time automatic counter to count and identify whether the number of gathering people complying with social distancing requirements or not to prevent the spread of the virus from an infected person to others the infected person or people who had physical contact with them must be isolated at the restricted areas or at home for example citizens who come back from highly infected countriesregions of covid-19 are often requested to be quarantined or self-isolate for 14 days due to the lack of facilities most countries require these people to self-isolate at home in this case the face recognition capability of computer vision can help to enforce this requirement by analyzing the images or videos from cameras to identify these people ie to check whether they breach the self-isolation requirements or not if these people are detected in public the authorities can be notified to take appropriate actions unlike object detection the dataset including the full face images of the isolated people needs to be built the face recognition system firstly learns from this dataset and then analyzes the images from public surveillance cameras to identify their appearances as in fig 12b1  the authors in 180 propose a framework named deepface using deep neutral network dnn which can detect with an accuracy of 9735 and 914 in labeled faces in the wild lfw and youtube faces ytf dataset respectively to improve the accuracy in detecting human from surveillance cameras some advanced techniques can be implemented such as 181  182 and 183  to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as covid-19 people are often required to wear masks in public places which necessitates approaches to recognize or identify people with masks as illustrated in fig 12b2  for example the cameras in front of a public building can recognize and send warning messages eg a beep sound to remind the person who does not wear a mask when heshe intends to get into the building this idea is introduced in 192 by using the cnn to detect people who do not wear the masks however this work is justs at the first step which still needs much more research on it to demonstrate the effectiveness as well as improve the accuracy 3 symptoms detection and monitoring after a few days of being infected with the virus the infected person may have some symptoms such as coughing or sneezing to minimize spreading the virus to others it would be very helpful if we can detect these symptoms from people in public and inform them or the authorities the idea here is similar as that of using thermal imaging cameras at airports or train stations specifically detecting human behaviors motion and pose in computer vision can play a pivotal role 187  pose estimation captures a person with different parts as illustrated in fig 12c  then detects human behaviors by studying the parts movements and their correlation for example a coughing person in fig 12 c usually moves his hand near his head and his head would have a vibration recognition of human behaviors from surveillance cameras is a challenging problem because the same behaviors may have different implications depending on the relationship with the context and other movements 188  the recent advances in aiml are instrumentals in correlating different movementsparts to interpret the associated behavior in 189 the authors propose to use cnn 173 to enhance the accuracy of the model of the interaction between different body parts in addition the authors in 190 introduce several methods to detect body parts of multiple person in 2d images and the authors in 191 propose methods to estimate 3d poses from matching of 2d pose estimation with a 3d pose library these works can be further developed for future studies to detect people with symptoms of the virus like coughing or sneezing in real-time to improve the accuracy of the symptom detection in social distancing computer vision-based behavior detection methods can be combined with other technologies eg thermal imaging to prevent the spread of the virus tracing the path of an infected person plays an important role to find out the people who were in the same place with the infected person for this purpose computer vision technology can not only detect the infected people by facial recognition but also contribute in the positioning process in 249  the movement of people is determined by analyzing the key point of transition frames captured from smartphone cameras this method can draw the trajectory of movements and the location with the accuracy around 2 meters in 250  the authors propose to combine the human detection techniques of computer vision with digital map information to improve the accuracy in this study the user path from cameras is mapped to the digital map which has the gps coordinates this method gave can achieve a very high accuracy within two meters in another approach the authors in 251 propose to use both smartphones cameras and inertial-sensor-based systems to accurately localize targets with only 69 cm error this approach uses fusion of keypoints and squared planar markers to enhance the accuracy for cameras to compensate the errors of inertial sensors 5 keeping distance keeping a suitable distance especially from crowds to prevent infection with the virus is one of the key factors of practicing social distancing to support people in keeping distance tofrom the crowds computer vision can be utilized in 248  the authors develop an ondevice machine learning-based system leveraging radar sensors and cameras of a smartphone when the radar sensor detects the surrounding moving objects the smartphone camera can be utilized to capture its surrounding environment taking into account the recorded data the smartphone can train the data using machine learning algorithms to determine the existence of nearby people and its distance from those people with respect to the social distancing requirements we can also use a smartphone to estimate the distance between the mobile user and other people using radar sensors and cameras along with machine learning algorithms in summary computer vision can be utilized in several social distancing scenarios especially the ones that require people monitoring and detection particularly computer vision is the only method that can differentiate between people and identify complex feature such as mask and symptoms thus computer vision technology can play a vital role in the social distancing scenarios to further improve the effectiveness of computer vision in the social distancing context future research should focus on increasing the accuracy and reducing the complexity of computer vision methods so that they can be integrated to existing systems such as surveillance cameras the ultrasound or ultrasonic positioning system ups is usually used in the indoor environment with the accuracy of centimeters 193  the system includes ultrasonic beacons ubs as tags or nodes attached on users and transceivers beacon units broadcast periodically ultrasonic pulses and radio frequency rf messages simultaneously with their unique id numbers based on these pulses and messages the receivers position can be determined by position calculation methods such as trilateration or triangulation 194  in comparison with other rf-based ranging methods the ups does not require a line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver and it also does not interfere with electromagnetic waves however since the propagation of the ultrasound wave is limited most ups applications for social distancing are only applicable for the indoor environment 1 keeping distance keeping distance in social distancing aims to maintain a safe distance between people to prevent the spread of the disease for this purpose ups can be used to position and notify people one of the first well known ups systems is active bat ab 195 based on the time-offlight of the ultrasonic pulse typically an ab system consists of an ultrasonic receiver matrix located on the ceiling or wall a transmitter attached to each target and a centralized computation system to calculate the objects positions as presented in 195  by using a receiver matrix with 16 sensors the ab system can achieve very high positioning accuracy ie less than 14 centimeters however a limitation of this system is its high complexity especially if a large number of ultrasonic sensors are deployed another limitation of the ab system is the privacy risk for users since the location of users under the ab system is calculated at the central server to address that the criket ck system is proposed in 199  200 wherein the position calculation is executed at the receivers specifically a receiver in the ck system passively receives rf and ultrasound signals from ubs located on the wall or ceiling and then the receiver calculates its position by itself based on ubs id and coordinates since the receivers do not transmit any signals the privacy of users will not be compromised fig 13 demonstrates the two systems in the keeping distance application 2 real-time monitoring in the context of social distancing ups can be an effective solution for real-time monitoring scenarios especially gauging the number of people in public buildings in particular a main characteristic that differs ups from other positioning technologies is confinement ie the ultrasound signal is confined within the same room as the ubs 194  among the other positioning technologies only the infrared technology shares the same characteristic nevertheless infrared signals prone to interference from sunlight and other thermal sources and they also suffer from line-ofsight loss 194  as a result ultrasound is the most efficient technology for binary positioning 194  ie determine if the object is in the same room as the ubs or not thus ups can be particularly useful in the social distancing scenarios where the exact positions of people are not as necessary as the number of people inside a room eg to limit the number of people this technology is more efficient because it needs a few reference nodes eg ubs to determine the binary positions of people which can significantly reduce implementation costs 3 automation ultrasound can also be applied in the social distancing scenarios that utilize medical robots or unmanned aerial vehicle uav mobile robots especially medical robots can play a key role in reducing the physical contact rates between the healthcare staffs eg doctors and nurses and the patients inside a hospital thereby maintaining a suitable social distancing level in such scenarios ups can help to improve the navigation of medical robots in 211  a navigation system based on wi-fi and ultrasound is proposed for indoor robot navigation to deal with the uncertainties which are very common in crowded places like hospitals the system employs a partially observable markov decision process and a novel algorithm is also introduced to minimize the calibration efforts in the social distancing context beside their outdoor appli-cations uavs can also be employed to reduce the necessity of human physical presence for example uavs can be used to deliver goods inside a building or to manage warehouse inventory however most of existing studies focus on uav navigation in the outdoor environnment which often relies on gnss for uav positioning since gnsss accuracy is low for the indoor environment these methods cannot be applied directly for uav navigation inside a building to address that limitation a navigation system is proposed in 207  which utilize ultrasound inertial sensors gnss and cameras to provide precise less than 10cm indoor navigation for multiple uavs in summary ultrasound can be applied in several social distancing scenarios in the keeping distance scenarios ups systems such as ab and ck can be applied directly to position and notify people to keep a safe distance moreover due to its confinement characteristic ultrasound is one of the most efficient technology for binary positioning which is particularly useful for monitoring and gauging the number of people inside the same room in the automation scenarios ultrasound can facilitate uavs and medical robots navigations especially for the indoor environment in the context of social distancing inertial-sensors-based systems can be applied in distance keeping and automation scenarios as illustrated in fig 14 for example positioning applications utilizing built-in inertial sensors can be developed for smartphone which can alert the users when they get close to each other or a crowd moreover inertial sensors can be integrated into robot and vehicles positioning which can facilitate autonomous delivery services and medical robots navigation all of these scenarios can contribute to reduce the physical contact rate between people inertial sensors consist of two special types of sensors namely gyroscopes and accelerometers attached to an object to measure its rotation and acceleration based on the measured rotation and acceleration data the orientation and position displacements of the object can be determined 285  because inertial sensors do not require any external reference system to function they have been one of the most common sensors for dead reckoning ie calculation of the current position is based on a previously determined position navigation systems such navigation systems can provide accurate positioning within a short time frame however since the current position is determined based on the previously calculated positions the errors accumulate over time ie integration drift therefore inertial-navigation-system ins is often used in combination with other positioning systems eg gps to periodically reset the base position 285  1 keeping distance traditionally ins have been widely used for aviation marine and land vehicles navigation recently the ever-increase presence of smartphones has enabled many ins applications for pedestrian positioning and navigation which can support social distancing scenarios moreover ins is one of the few technologies that can enable accurate pedestrian positioning for outdoor environment especially fig 13  ultrasound application for keeping distance using a cricket system 199  and b active bat system 195  fig 14 inertial-sensors-based systems for several social distancing scenarios when combined with other outdoor positioning technique such as gps in 286  a smartphone-based positioning system is proposed the system makes use of a smartphones builtin sensors including gyroscopes accelerometers and magnetometers sensors that measure magnetism to calculate the smartphones position in particular magnetometers are combined with gyroscopes to improve the accuracy in rotation measurements this is done by correlating their measurements via a novel algorithm which uses four different thresholds to determine the weights of the gyroscope and magnetometers measurements in the correlation function in 287  a novel indoor positioning system is developed using wi-fi and ins technologies in this system ins is utilized for the area where wi-fi coverage is limited while wi-fi positioning is used to compensate inss integration drift another positioning system using inertial sensors and wi-fi is presented in 288  where wi-fi fingerprinting technique is used to improve the accuracy of the dead reckoning navigation because of the integration drift a dead reckoning navigation system needs to frequently update its position by referencing to an external node in the proposed system a wi-fi fingerprinting map is set up in advance and the dead reckoning system can use the map to update its position moreover in 252  the authors proposed using kalman filter to combine the measurement data from wi-fi and ins which can reduce the error to 153 meter beside wi-fi ins can be used in combination with other positioning technologies in 289 and 290  ins has been combined with the uwb technology for pedestrian positioning and tracking generally ins helps to reduce uwbs high implementation cost and complexity while inss integration drift can be compensated particularly ins is employed to compensate for the uwbs low dynamic range and proneness to external radio disturbances in 289  to enable the combination an information fusion technique using the extended kalman filter is proposed to fuse the measurement data coming from both the ins and uwb sensors the result shows that the hybrid system can achieve better performance than both the individual systems in 290  the information fusion problem between the ins and uwb is optimized to minimize the uncertainties in the measurements as a result the positioning accuracy can be significantly improved 2 automation besides pedestrian positioning ins can also be applied for social distancing scenarios involving autonomous vehicles eg medical robots and drone delivery generally ins has been commonly used for medical robots applications including surgeon assists patient motion assists and delivery robots in this section we will only focus on the medical and delivery robots applications for social distancing purposes in 291  a novel ins system is developed specifically for mobile robot navigation in addition an error model is proposed to increase the accuracy of the involved inertial measurements a kalman filter is also proposed to precisely estimate the velocity and orientation of the robot in the presence of noises a novel data fusion algorithm leveraging an adaptive kalman filter is presented in 292 for indoor robot positioning based on a insuwb hybrid system unlike ins for mobile robots that are mostly developed for indoor environment ins for uav focuses on outdoor applications note that uav navigation must also consider its altitude which adds more complexity the authors of 293 leverage inertial sensors and cameras to determine the uavs position velocity and altitude particularly the cameras attached to the uav capture the images of the surrounding environment and send to a control station this station will then process the images to determine the uavs pose in regards to the surroundings the poses data is then combined with the inertial sensors data via a kalman filter to determine the uavs position and velocity similarly a system combining inertial and vision sensors is developed in 294 for uav positioning and navigation the system utilizes two observers which have inertial and vision sensors the first observer calculates the orientation based on gyroscope and vision sensors while the second observer determines the position and velocity based on data from the accelerometers and vision sensors summary the omnipresence of smartphones with built-in inertial sensors has opened many opportunities for developing positioning systems based on ins for the distance keeping scenarios ins positioning systems especially for pedestrians can play a vital role as they are readily available in the other scenarios such as medical robot and uav delivery ins-based techniques can help to increase the efficiency better path lower traveling time of the existing navigation systems the recent development in the light emitting diodes leds technology has enabled the use of existing light infrastructures for communication and localization purposes due to attractive features of visible lights such as reliability robustness and security 215 - 217  visible light communication vlc systems usually comprise two major components ie led lights corresponding to transmitters to send necessary information eg user data and positioning information via visible lights and photo detectors eg photodiodes or imaging sensors eg camera playing the role of receivers 17  due to the ubiquitous presence of led lights vlc can be leveraged in many social distancing scenarios as discussed below 1 real-time monitoring communication systems using visible light eg led-based communications can provide precise navigation and localization solutions in indoor environments utilizing this technology some applications can be implemented to support social distancing such as tracking individuals who are being quarantined detecting and monitoring crowds in public places eg shopping malls airports train stations and workplaces as shown in fig 15a  a photodiode-based vlc systems due to many advantages such as low cost and easy to implement the vlc receiver using photodiodes can be employed as a tag that is integrated into mobile targets such as trolleysshopping carts autonomous robots etc people attached with these tags can perform self-positioning based on the triangulation method so that they can avoid crowed areas furthermore the tags locations can be collected by the authorities to monitor people in the public areas based on this location data further actions can be carried out such as warning people by varying the color temperature of the lights in the crowded areas it is worth noting that this solution can not reveal any personal information of users eg customers since it only requires communications between vlc-based tags and light fixtures however most vlc systems only provide a half-duplex communications due to the fact that led lights operate as the role of transmitters therefore they should be combined with other wireless technologies like bluetooth 218  219  infrared 220 to enable an uplink communication with the server for location information exchange moreover to improve the accuracy of positioning people in indoor environments using photodiodes some advanced techniques can be used such as data fusion of aoa and rss methods proposed in 221 and the aoa method using a multi-led element lighting fixture introduced in 222  one main disadvantage of the photodiodebased vlc systems is the need of additional hardware ie the photodiode receiver mounted on smart trolleysshopping carts to receive light signals consequently the system might fail to detect the locations of people who do not carry them nevertheless purelifi company has recently invented a tiny optical front end which can be integrated into smartphones to take benefits of the photodiode receiver in high accuracy vlc-based localization services 223  b camera-based vlc systems the rapid development of smartphones has enabled vlc-based applications on handheld devices such as indoor localization and navigation applications eg smart retail systems 218  219  224  these system use front-facing cameras of mobile phones to receive visible light signals contained positioning information eg the led lights id or location from visible light beacons 225  the captured photos collected regularly by the front-facing camera are sent to a cloudfog server for image processing to alleviate the computation on the phone then the beacons id and coordinates can be extracted and sent back to the phone after that the aoa algorithm is implemented to estimate the location and orientation of the phone an attractive use case of the camera-based vlc systems 218  219  224 is to assist users to quickly find specific products in shopping malls or supermarkets thus we can adopt this function to implement tracking and monitoring crowds in public places eg shopping malls airports and train stations as well as assisting people to avoid crowds in a proactive manner it is worth noting that this solution is more convenient than using photodiodes since it uses front-facing cameras of smartphones as the vlc receivers thus everyone using smartphones can be tracked however due to continuous photo shooting these positioning applications are very energyconsuming which is a major drawback of camera-based vlc systems when they are used for tracking people 2 automation in public places there is always a need for assistance in specific circumstances eg information or physical supports for customers older and disabled people for instance supporting staffs in supermarkets can assist customers to find products or help olderdisabled people to carry their goods similar assistance scenarios can be seen in hospitals banks and libraries this results in an increase of close physical contacts between customers and assistants therefore autonomous assistance systems using vlc technology can be employed to minimize the physical contacts as shown in fig 15a and b  a information assistance besides the navigation purpose the smart retail systems 218  219 can also provide information assistance services for shoppers for example the product description sale information or other necessary information can be displayed on screen when the phone is under a certain led light another example system is information assistance services in museum 226  227  this can help to reduce the number of close physical contacts in these places b autonomous robot similar to the information assistance systems for reducing close physical contacts autonomous robots using the vlc technology for communication and localization can also be deployed to assist people in certain circumstances for example elderly-assistant robots walking-assistant robots shopping-assistant robots etc 228  229  moreover visible light signals do not cause any interference to rf signals and thus they can effectively deployed in diverse indoor environments such as hospitals schools and workplaces 3 traffic control in the context of social distancing high demand traffic can cause a large concentration of people in a certain area eg city centre by adopting smart traffic light systems in 230  231  we can deploy an intelligent traffic controlling system using the vlc technology to control large traffic flows as illustrated in fig 15c  that can help to avoid high density of vehicles in public areas the vlc technology provides a communication method between vehicles and the light infrastructure eg traffic lights street lights first vehicles can send its information eg their ids to the light infrastructure by using its headlights as transmitters thus the system can detect and monitor the traffic flow however in this case it is required that the light infrastructure must be equipped with vlc receivers eg traffic cameras or photodiodes second based on the awareness of the traffic the system can control the vehicles by sending instructions to guide them in this case the system uses traffic lights or street lights as transmitters to send information and the vehicles use dash cameras to receive the information for example the system will notify them about hot zones that have a high density of vehicles and do not allow them to enter so that they can avoid these zones in conclusion the availability of smart retail systems is proof of the superior performance and convenience of vlc technology compared to other rf technologies in high precise indoor localization and navigation by leveraging such commercial approaches we can deploy the cost-effective crowd monitoring system on a large scale not only in shopping malls or hypermarkets but also in other public places such as airports train stations and hospitals based on the existing illuminating infrastructures buildingfacilities managers can immediately alert or notify the users if they are in the middle of a crowd eg varying the color temperature of the lights in the high-density zones people can also take the initiative in planning their move to the desired locations without encountering the crowds on the other hand assistance systems help to reduce the number of staffsvolunteers nurses inside public buildings or limit the close contacts between them and customers patients moreover the combination with other rf technologies such as bluetooth and infrared also ensures the location-based services are not interrupted when the smartphone is not being actively used by the user eg the phone is in the pocket last but not least the vlc technology can be a potential communication method between the intelligent traffic controlling system and vehicles in the outdoor environment however the main disadvantage of the vlc technology is that interference from ambient and sun lights have significant impacts on the visible light communication channels 215  217  it results in poor performance of the rss-based positioning approaches and outdoor communications thermal based positioning systems can be briefly classify into two main categories which are infrared positioning irp systems and thermal imaging camera thc typical irp systems such as 232  235  236 are low-cost short-range up to 10 meters systems that use infrared ir signals to determine the position of targets via aoa or toa measurement method on the other hand the thc which constructs images from the objects heat emission can operate at a larger range up to a few kilometers 240  because of this difference irp and thc can be applied in different social distancing scenarios as discussed below 1 keeping distance in keeping distance scenarios irp systems such as active badge 235  firefly 237  and op-totrak 236 can be utilized in the active badge badges that periodically emits unique ir signals are attached to the targets based on the distances from the fixed infrared sensors to the badges the targets position can be calculated as a result this application can be useful to determine the distance between two people as well as to identify crowds in the indoor environments one of main advantages of this solution is low cost and easy implementation however it requires user to wear tag devices to track their locations to achieve a higher positioning accuracy the firefly 237 and optotrak 236 systems can be implemented these systems contain infrared camera arrays and infrared transmitter called markers due to the difference in setups one target is attached with one tag in firefly and multiple tags in optotrak the firefly system can accurately determine the targets 3d position whereas the optotrak system can capture the targets movement the main disadvantage of these systems is that they are prone to interference from other radiation sources such as sunlight and light bulbs combined with their short-range irp is mostly applicable in small rooms with poor-light conditions 2 contact tracing since the firefly and optotrak systems can accurately capture movements they can be useful for contact tracing scenarios in social distancing for example markers can be attached to the targets body parts which are usually used in physical contacts eg hands for handshakes and body for hugs the movement of these body parts can then be captured by the ir camera as illustrated in fig 16  and the recorded data can be analyzed later to determine if there is close contacts between the target and other people based on this information the contacts that the target made can be traced later if necessary fig 16  contact tracing by infrared system 237  3 real-time monitoring for traffic monitoring in social distancing contexts both irp and thc can be utilized especially in poor-light conditions the authors in 239 propose a robust vehicle detector based on the irp under the condition to quantify traffic level and flow the collected data can be sent to help the authorities in social distancing monitoring however since irp has a short range thc systems such as 242 can be a better choice in a larger area with high density of vehicles due to its very high observation range a few kilometers 241 - 243  thc is particularly effective for real-time monitoring scenarios such as public building monitoring detecting closure violation and non-essential travel detection which does not requires high positioning accuracy thc systems such as those proposed in 232  233 are efficient in these scenarios since they are light-weight and can cover wide area with a medium accuracy another application of thermal technology is to detect susceptible groups since the thcs measure heat emitted from people or other objects they can be used for checking peoples temperature quickly from a far distance 244  245  further the thc system has the ability to detect slight differences in heat with a resolution of 001 degree 246  thus it can be a good means to check health conditions and sickness trends of patients moreover the system can be deployed in shopping centers to measure customers temperature remotely this can help to detect infection symptoms early and also the prevent disease spreading in summary thermal based positioning systems are helpful in some social distancing scenarios especially in poor-light conditions for short-range communication applications the irp is cost effective and can be used for positioning and tracing purposes whereas some light-weight thc systems can be leverage for monitoring over large distances due to their high range can be used in real-time monitoring in large areas with larger vision and resolution however the high cost of thc should be considered when implementing in practice vision 177  178  186  188  190  191 depends on the cameras low to high medium to high low high both public and private camera systems ultrasound 194  195  207  211 short confined by walls less than 14cm 195 high low 195 to high 199 yes indoor none inertial sensors 285 - 288  291  295 not applicable  in this section we discuss the open issues of social distancing implementation such as security and privacy concerns social distancing encouragement work-from-home and the increased demands in healthcare appointment home healthcare services and online services to addressed these issues potential solutions are also presented most aforementioned social distancing scenarios see table iii for more details call for peoples private information to a different extent ranging from their faceappearance to location travel records or health conditiondata these data if not protected properly attract cyber attackers and can turn users into victims of financial criminal frauds 316  users data like health conditions can also adversely impact peoples employment opportunity or insurance policy given that to enable technology-based social distancing it is critical to develop privacy-preserving and cybersecurity solutions to ensure that users private data are properly used and protected the general principle of users privacy-preserving is to keep each individual users sensitive information private when the available data are being accessed by public to do so data privacy-preserving mechanisms including data anonymization randomization and aggregation can be utilized 306  for example apple google and facebook have developed people mobility trend reports while preserving users privacy during the covid-19 outbreak in particular apple utilizes random and rotating identifiers to preserve mobile users movements privacy 309  meanwhile google aggregates and uses anonymized dataset from mobile users who turn on their location history settings in their android smartphones in this case a differential privacy approach is applied by adding random noise to the location dataset with the aim to mask individual identification of a mobile user 307  similar to google facebook utilizes aggregated and anonymized user mobility datasets and maps to determine the mobility trend in certain areas including the social connectedness intensity among nearby locations 308  in addition to the apples googles and facebooks latest privacy-preserving implementation in the following we will thoroughly discuss how the latest advances in security and privacy-preserving techiques can help to facilitate social distancing without compromising users interestprivacy fig 18  location-based privacy preserving for social distancing scenarios in social distancing some advanced location-based privacy protection methods can be adopted specifically we can anonymizerandomizeobfuscateperturb the exact location of each mobile user to avoid malicious attacks from the attackers using the following mechanisms for example the authors in 317 develop a privacy-preserving location-based framework to anonymize spatio-temporal trajectory datasets utilizing machine learning-based anonymization mla in this case the framework applies the k-means machine learning algorithm to cluster the trajectories from real-world gps datasets and ensure the k-anonymity for high-sensitive datasets using the k-anonymity 318  319  the framework can collect location information from k mobile users within a cloaking region ie the region where the mobile users exact locations are hidden 320  321  in 322  the use of k-anonymity is extended into a continuous network location privacy anonymity ie k dt-anonymity which not only considers the average anonymity size k but also takes the average distance deviation d and the anonymity duration t into account leveraging those three metrics the mobile users under realistic vehicle mobility conditions can control the changes of anonymity and distance deviation magnitudes over time the authors in 323 propose a mutually obfuscating paths method which allows the vehicles to securely update accurate real-time location to a location-based service server in the vehicular network in this case the vehicles first hide their ip addresses due to the default network address translation operated by mobile internet service providers then they generate fake path segments that separate from the vehicles actual paths to prevent the location-based service server from tracking the vehicles exploiting dedicated short range communications dsrc among vehicles and road navigation information from the gps the vehicles can mutually generate made-up location updates with each other when they communicate with the location-based service server to obtain spatio-temporal-related information in 324  vehicles which use location-based services can dynamically update virtual locations in a realtime with respect to the relative locations of current nearby vehicles this aims to provide deceptive information about the driving routes to attackers thereby enhancing location privacy protection in addition to the anonymization and obfuscating methods the use of randomization and perturbation to preserve the users locations have been investigated in the following works in 325  a location privacy-preserving method leveraging spatio-temporal events of mobile users in continuous location-based services eg office visitation is investigated specifically an -differential privacy is designed to protect spatio-temporal event against attackers through adding random noise to the event data 328 - 330  in 331  the authors present a location privacy protection mechanism using data perturbation for smart health system in a hospital in particular instead of reporting the patients real locations directly a main processing unit attached to a patients body can adaptively produce perturbed locations ie the relative change between different locations of the patient in this case the system considers the patients travel directions and computes the distance between the patients current locations and the patients sensitive locations ie patients pre-defined locations which heshe does not want to reveal to anyone eg patients treating room using this dynamic location perturbation the need of a trusted third party to store real locations can be removed leveraging the aforementioned methods we can also prevent the service provider to access mobile users and vehicles exact locationstrajectoriespaths when they implement social distancing for crowdtraffic density and movement detection specifically a platoon of mobile usersvehicles in a certain area can collaborate together to mix their real locationstrajectoriespaths anonymously  fig 18a  in this way the service provider will only obtain the aggregated locationtrajectorypath information of the platoon instead of each individuals exact locationtrajectorypath for its location privacy 2 personal identity protection in addition to protecting mobile users location-related information preserving their personal identities is of importance to improve users acceptance of latest technologies to social distancing specifically we can exchange or anonymize personal identities among trusted mobile users to avoid the attackers identifying the actual identity of each individual user in 332  the authors de-velop a pseudo-identity exchanging protocol to swapexchange identity information among mobile users when they are at the same sensitive locations eg hospital and residential areas in particular when a mobile user receives another trusted users identity and private key the mobile user will verify if the encryption of another users identity hash function and public key is equal to the encryption of the received private key if that condition holds the mobile user will change hisher identity with that users identity and vice versa in another work the authors in 333 introduce an individual information privacy protection through indirect-or proxyrequest in particular instead of directly submitting a request to the server a mobile user can have hisher social friends through the available social network resources ie trusted social medias to distribute hisher request anonymously to the server the request result can be returned to hisher social friends and then forwarded to the requested mobile user thereby preserving the requested mobile users identity in fact there may exist some malicious friends which expose the identity of the mobile user therefore the authors in 334 investigate a user-defined privacy-sharing framework on social network to choose hisher particular friends who are trusted to obtain the mobile users identity information in this case the mobile user only shares hisher identity information with the particular friends whose pseudonyms match the mobile users identity through authorized access control using the same approaches from the above works we can use local wireless connections eg bluetooth and wi-fi direct to anonymously exchange actual location information in a mobile user group ie between a mobile user and hisher trusted nearby mobile users in an ad hoc way as shown in fig 18b  when the service provider requires to collect location-related information for the current crowd density detection a representative mobile user from the group can send the groups anonymous location information to the service provider aiming at preserving personal identity of each mobile user in the group moreover apple and google have recently introduced a key schedule for contact tracing to ensure the privacy of users 65  specifically there are three types of key i tracing key ii daily tracing key and iii rolling proximity identifier the tracing key is a 32-byte string that is generated by using a cryptographic random number generator when the app is enabled on the device the tracing key is securely stored on the device the daily tracing key is generated for every 24-hour window by using the sha-256 hash function with the tracing key the rolling proximity identifier is a privacy-preserving identifier which is sent in bluetooth advertisements this identifier is generated by using the sha-256 hash function with the daily tracing key each time the bluetooth mac address change the app can derive a new identifier when a positive case is diagnosed their daily tracing keys are uploaded to a server this server then distributes them to the clients who use the app based on this information each of the clients will be able to derive the sequence of the rolling proximity identifiers that were broadcasted from the user who tested positive in this way the privacy of the users can be ensured because without the daily tracing key one cannot obtain the users rolling proximity identifier in addition the server operator also cannot track the users location or who users have been in proximity similarly several solutions have been proposed in 67  68  the key idea of these solutions is generating a unique identifier and broadcasting it to nearby devices in particular pact 67 regularly every few seconds emits a data string called chirps generated by cryptographic techniques based on the current time and the current seed of the user to ensure the privacy similarly in 68  the identifier e phi d called ephemeral id is created as follows where prf is a pseudo-random function eg sha-256 broadcast key is a fixed and public string and prg is a stream cipher eg aes in counter mode sk t is the secret key of each user during day t which is computed as follows where h is a cryptographic hash function upon receiving the identifier other nearby devices will keep it as a log if a user is diagnosed with the disease other users who may have encountered with the infected person will receive a warning of a potential contact 3 health-related information protection to monitor the sickness trend in a certain place eg the hospital for social distancing purpose ie to inform the upcoming mobile users not to enter a high-risk areabuilding the health-related condition information of visiting mobile users require to be shared to provide reliable learning dataset to protect this highly sensitive information the authors in 335 proposes a differential privacy-based protection approach to preserve the electrocardiogram big data through utilizing body sensor networks in particular non-static noises are applied to produce sufficient interference along with the electrocardiogram data thereby preventing the malicious attackers to point out the real electrocardiogram data to provide secure health-related information access for authenticated users a dynamic privacy-preserving approach leveraging biometric authentication process is introduced in 336  specifically when a user wants to access the medical server containing hisher health condition a secure biometric identification at the server for the users validity is employed where the exact value of hisher biometric template remains unknown to the server in this way the personal identity of the authenticated user can be preserved to further enhance the anonymity of hisher medical information the random number that is used to protect the biometric template is updated after every successful login then the authors in 337 propose a secure anonymous authentication model for wireless body area networks wbans specifically this framework enables both patients and authorized medical professionals securely and anonymously examine their legitimacies prior to exchanging biomedical information in the wban systems motivated from the above works we can utilize iot and mobile devices secure service provider and the aforementioned privacy preserving approaches to anonymously collect peoples health condition information for illness monitoring in the hospitalmedical centre fig 18c  in this way the social distancing through monitoring the sickness trend can be implemented efficiently while preserving the sensitive information of the people in the illness areas in the context of social distancing real-time scheduling and optimization techniques can play a key role in preventing too many people at the same place eg supermarkets hospitals while maintaining a reasonable quality-of-service level fig 19 illustrates several social distancing scenarios where scheduling and optimization techniques can be applied in particular scheduling techniques can be applied to reduce the number of necessary employees at the workplace and the number of patients coming to the hospital thereby reducing the unnecessary contacts among people moreover traffic scheduling can help to reduce the peak number of vehicles and pedestrians and optimization techniques can help to deal with the extra pressures on the online services when there are more people staying at home 1 workforce scheduling workforce scheduling can help to limit the number of people at the workplaces while ensuring the necessary work is done while working from home is encouraged in social distancing sometimes employees must be present at the workplace for certain tasks eg machine operators moreover different types of tasks impose different constraints such as due date time constraints dependence among tasks precedence constraints skill requirements skill constraints and limited resources usage resource constraints which further complicates the scheduling problem for such scenarios workforce scheduling techniques can be utilized to optimally align and reduce the number of required employees to practice social distancing in 263  a novel threephase algorithm is proposed for workforce scheduling to optimize the operational cost and service level simultaneously another genetic-algorithm-based hybrid approach is presented in 264  which optimizes the schedules of workforce according to multiple objectives including urgency skill considerations and workload balance similarly in 265  a mixed-integer-programming-based approach is developed to minimize the operational cost with consideration of skill constraints it is worth noting that the main objective of these approaches is to minimize cost which is not the highest priority in the context of social distancing in 266  267  and 268  several methods are proposed to optimize the workforce schedules with consideration of rotating shifts which indirectly reduce the number of employees to a certain extent nevertheless the main objective of these approaches is also reducing cost therefore developing techniques which account for the physical contacts or distance among employees at the workplace is critical for workforce scheduling in social distancing scenarios 2 medicalhealth appointment scheduling beside workforce planning scheduling techniques can also help to optimize healthcare services especially healthcare appointments and home healthcare services thereby decreasing unnecessary traffic and the number of patients coming to hospitals several approaches have been proposed to effectively schedule appointments in particular a local search algorithm is proposed in 269 to minimize the patient waiting times doctor idle times and tardiness lateness moreover a two-stage bounding approach and a heuristic is presented in 270 and 272  respectively however a common limitation of these techniques is that they do not take into account the uncertainties in the duration of the appointments and the possibility that the patient will not come to the scheduled appointment to address that the uncertainty in the processing times eg of surgeries is considered by a conic optimization approach in 271  similarly a multistage stochastic linear program is developed in 273 to minimize patient waiting times and overtime which takes into account the unpredictable appointment duration and unplanned cancellations although there are many effective approaches to optimize appointment scheduling the open issue is to develop techniques that specifically minimize or control the number of patients simultaneously coming to the hospitals to maintain a suitable level of social distancing similar to that of the workforce scheduling scenario 3 home healthcare scheduling similar to appointment scheduling home healthcare services hhs can help to reduce the pressure on hospitals and traffic in the social distancing context in 274  a multi-heuristics approach is proposed for hhs scheduling to minimize the total traveling times of hhs staff an extended problem is presented in 275  where the objective also includes minimizing the tardiness and additional skills and time constraints are considered for this problem local search-based heuristics are proposed in the paper an-other local search-based heuristic is proposed in 276 for hhs scheduling with the objective to minimize traveling times and optimize quality-of-service while considering workload and time constraints in 277  a genetic-algorithm-based hybrid approach is proposed for hhs scheduling with uncertainty in patients demands to minimize transportation cost also addressing uncertainties a branch-and-price algorithm is proposed in 278 to minimize the traveling costs and delay of services while considering stochastic service times unlike in workforce planning and appointment scheduling hhs scheduling techniques can be directly applied in the related social distancing scenario because they already aimed to minimize the traveling distances while ensuring quality-of-service 4 traffic control furthermore scheduling techniques have also been applied for traffic control in social distancing scenarios scheduling techniques can help to regulate the traffic level especially the number of pedestrians in 279  a novel scheduling algorithm is developed for traffic control considering both vehicles and pedestrians to minimize the delays similarly a macroscopic model and a scheduling algorithm is proposed for traffic control that jointly minimize both the pedestrians and vehicle delays in 280  another scheduling approach is proposed in 281 that considers both pedestrians and vehicles different from the previously mentioned approaches this approach only focuses on minimizing pedestrian delay although there is a vast literature on traffic scheduling techniques the social distancing implications have not been taken into account for example to maintain social distancing a more meaningful objective would be to reduceconstrain the peak number of pedestrians on the street at the same time 5 online services optimization when social distancing measures are implemented more people will be staying at home eg working from home physical meetingsgatherings will move to virtual platforms eg webinars that results in much higher internet traffic and corresponding virtual service demands eg video streaming broadcasting and contents delivery therefore optimizing online services delivery is a challenging issue in the social distancing context fortunately online services optimization is a well-studied topic with a substantial body of supporting literature for example in 282  a novel algorithm is proposed to optimize the contents delivery process in a cdn semi-federation system in particular the algorithm optimally allocate the content providers demand to multiple content delivery networks cdns in the federation the results show that the latency can be reduced by 20 during the peak hours another technique to reduce the delay and network congestion is edge-caching which brings the contents closer to the network users in 283  the performance of two edge-caching strategies ie coded and uncoded caching are analyzed moreover two optimization algorithms are developed to minimize the content delivery times for the two caching strategies beside the contents delivery the demands on video streaming traffic is also much higher during social distancing implementation because there are many people who work from home in that context emerging networking technologies can be an effective solution for example an architecture utilizing http adaptive streaming 284 and software defined networking is proposed to enable video streaming over http moreover a novel algorithm is developed to optimally allocates users into groups thereby reducing communication overhead and leveraging network resources the results show that the proposed framework can increase video stability quality-of-service and resource utilization summary scheduling and optimization are well-studied topics with a vast literature available which can be utilized for different social distancing scenarios such as workforce  healthcare appointment home healthcare and traffic scheduling and optimization of online services delivery nevertheless except for the home healthcare service scenario the existing techniques objectives do not align with the objectives of social distancing moreover scheduling algorithms often are developed such that they are only efficient for their specific problems therefore developing novel optimizationscheduling algorithms in operations research and adopting social distancing as a new performance metric or design parameter is very much desirable furthermore the optimization of internetbased services such as content delivery can help to encourage people to stay at home during social distancing periods by ensuring the service levels due to the peoples self-interestedselfish nature characteristics in their daily life 348 especially during the pandemic outbreak incentive mechanisms can be very helpful in encouraging people to accept or share relevant information to enable new social distancing methods these mechanisms have been thoroughly discussed in crowdsourcing as implemented in 326  353 - 356  in this case the service providers can provide incentives to a large number of people to attract their contributions in data collection for crowdsourcing process for example the contract theory-based incentive mechanism for crowsourcing is discussed in 353  354  in particular this approach is considered as an efficient mechanism to leverage common agreements between the participating enttities eg a service provider and its mobile users in a certain area under complete and incomplete information from the participants 349  the use of game theory-based incentive mechanism to encourage a set of mobile users form a crowsourcing community network is investigated in 326  355  then in 356  the authors utilize an auction theory-based approach incentive mechanism to stimulate mobile user participating in the crowsourcing tasks including traffic monitoring in the following we also highlight the existing incentive mechanisms and how they can be further adopted to encourage the social distancing applications 1 distance between any two people and distance tofrom crowds to motivate people to keep distance from themselves to others contract theory-based incentive model via d2d communications eg bluetooth wi-fi direct can be employed in 350  the authors propose a contract theory-based mechanism to provide a higher reward for d2d-capable mobile users if they send the information to a requesting mobile user with a higher transmission data rate taking number of potential nearby mobile users in proximity the authors in 351 introduce the same mechanism such that a mobile user will receive a higher payment if they can share the information to more nearby mobile users likewise the same approach considering a higher reward for a mobile user who has shorter distances in sharing its information to nearby d2d pairs is presented in 352  inspired by the aforementioned works we can consider the contract theory-based method along with d2d communications to encourage people to keep distances from other peoplecrowds specifically mobile service providers can be subsidizedfunded or requested by the government to provide incentives to their users to keep distance from others when they are in public specifically a service provider can offer contracts to mobile users as illustrated in fig 20a  considering the current distances from the nearby mobile users and capability to inform them through d2d communications those mobile users can obtain more rewards when they successfully keep a sufficient distance eg at least 15 meters from other peopleusers a violation eg getting closer than 15 meters to someone can lead to penalty eg losing part of the previous rewards 2 contact tracing in a pandemic outbreak contact tracing is considered as one of the most important actions to contain the spread of the disease to trigger each mobile user for information sharing eg mobile users public identity the network operator requires to offer incentives to those who contribute such information beside privacy-preserving solutions in 353  the authors introduce a contract theory-based incentive mechanism in a crowdsourced wireless community network in particular the network operator offers contracts to network-sharing mobile users containing a wi-fi access price for their nearby mobile users accessing the network sharing and a subscription fee for the network-sharing mobile users motivated from this work we can also develop a contacttracing framework which allows a mobile user to broadcast hisher public identity to the nearby mobile users as long as their distances are within 15 meters then the nearby mobile users can store this public identity in their close-contact log files including the time and location when they receive that public identity as shown in fig 20b  as a compensation for this information sharing they need to pay a certain payment to the sharing mobile user correspondingly in this way when at least one of the mobile users in the log files is infected by the contagious disease the mobile service provider can alert the mobile users with the log files to implement social distancing 3 crowd detection high density of people in specific areas can help contagious diseases to spread the infection more quickly due to peoples close proximity to support the social distancing an incentive mechanism approach can also be applied to detect the people density in public areas or the number of people in a building in 354  the authors present a tournament model-based incentive mechanism to encourage mobile users with various performance ranks connected to the local wireless networks eg wi-fi hotspots to send the location and unique identifier of the networks to the service provider  fig 20c  from the hotspots location information the service provider can then determine the people density in each hotspot area or the number of people in a building which may have several hotspot areas using the above method we can also encourage the mobile users to avoid non-essential public places eg restaurants and shopping malls in this case the reward can be adapted according to the locations and essential level of the services eg cinemas restaurants grocery stores schools and hospital in addition to the people density detection we can adopt an incentive mechanism to monitor the density of vehicles on the city roads for traffic crowd avoidance purpose in fact the contagious diseases eg coronavirus can remain on the surfaces for 4 hours up to several days 357  thus avoiding traffic jam on the roads can reduce the possibility of the disease infection in 358  the authors propose a reward-based smartphone collaboration method to support data acquisition for location-based services specifically a client will attract surrounding smartphone users eg vehicular users on a highway to collaborate together with the aim to build a big database containing location information as implemented in googles android smarphones and apples iphone 359  the joining smartphone users then receive shared rewards from the client considering their collaboration costs based on this database the client can determine the traffic levels according to the vehicles density on the roads dynamically then the client can sell these information to a service provider which are further used to inform upcoming vehicular users avoid crowds on the roads for social distancing implementation 4 locationmovement sharing stay-at-home encouragement to further drive people away from high density public places we can also consider incentive mechanisms for better social distancing efficiency especially for the people with their mobile devices in particular the authors in 360 study the uneven distribution of the crowdsourcing participants when maximizing the social welfare of the network to address this problem a movement-based incentive mechanism to stimulate the participants move from popular areas to unpopular ones was introduced this approach guarantees that the participants will announce their actual costs for further reward process likewise an incentive mechanism in spatial crowdsourcing considering budget constraints to reduce imbalanced data collection is discussed in 361  particularly the service provider will provide a higher reward when the mobile users are willing to participate at the remote locations instead of nearby locations where they belong to based on their daily routines a similar work utilizing a redistribution algorithm to incentivize crowdsourced service providers from oversupplied areas to undersupplied ones is also investigated in 327  the above works are then extended in 362  instead of encouraging mobile users to completely move to faraway locations the service provider will offer a task-bundling containing the nearby and remote tasks for each participating mobile user all of these works show that the proposed incentive mechanisms can efficiently balance the various location popularity such that we can encourage people move to less density places in a narrow-down scenario we can also utilize an incentive mechanism to encourage family-isolationgroup-isolation for the possible vulnerableat-risk people eg sick people and older people for example the authors in 363 propose a spatio-temporal-based incentive mechanism using both smartphone and human intelligence in an ad hoc social network this framework allows a very large crowd to work together in providing information sharing ie geo-tagged multimedia resources while receiving incentives from the system based on this method we can also engage the vulnerableat-risk groups to isolate themselves and deliver incentives for them at a certain location during a particular period fig 20d  the larger number of vulnerableat-risk members in a group the higher incentives will be given furthermore we can design a real-time incentive mechanism to encourage people to implement self-isolation through providing more rewards for those who spend more time at a given location eg at home in this case the reward can be negative ie penalty to discourage people from going to crowded places an occasional pandemic outbreak in a particular period can drive the mobile service providers eg google and apple to build up a pandemic mode application for current users mobile devices eg smartphones this application represents a comprehensive framework utilizing the current pandemic situation ie infected movement data to help the mobile users stay aware of the contagious diseases and perform cautious actions to slow down the spread of the diseases through implementing social distancing to this end the use of users smartphones is very crucial to realize this pandemic mode application as similarly implemented for smartphone-based disaster mode application in 297 - 303  when a contagious disease outbreak is imminent the government can first broadcast an urgent notification for mobile users to installdeploy the official pandemic mode application in their smartphones then based on the current infected movement data eg current reported number of infected people and current infected areas from the government officials the service providers can determine the risk levels of the pandemic and activate a certain level in the smartphones considering the risk level the smartphones can leverage the existing sensors and wireless connections to perform effective contact tracing activity for contagious disease containment 1 infected movement data to determine the risk levels of pandemic mode the service providers first need to monitor the current infected movement information ie infected areas and number of infected people based on this observation the service providers then can orchestrate the pandemic mode risk levels and notify mobile users such that they can avoid the areas where the highly-likely infection exists according to the current risk level in 304  the authors introduce an identification framework to observe the spatial infection spread based on the arrival records of infectious cases in subpopulation areas considering susceptible and infectious people movement in metapopulation networks the framework first splits the whole infection spread into disjoint subpopulation areas then a maximum likelihood estimation is applied to predict the most likely invasion pathways at each subpopulation area using a dynamic programming-based algorithm the framework can finally reconstruct the whole spread by iteratively assembling the invasion pathways for each subpopulation to produce the final invasion pathways then the authors in 305 present a spatial-temporal technique to locate realtime influenza epidemics utilizing heterogeneous data from the internet in particular the technique constructs a multivariate hidden markov model through aggregating influenza morbidity data influenza-related data from google and international air transportation data this aims to identify the spatialtemporal relationship of influenza transmission which will be used for surveillance application through experimental results the technique can predict an influenza epidemic ahead of the actual event with high accuracy recently google and apple also create a framework to demonstrate the community mobility trend with respect to the covid-19 outbreak 307  309  in particular this framework is generated based on the regions of mobile users and change in visits monitoring at various public places eg groceries pharmacies parks transit stations workplaces and residential areas motivated by the above works we can utilize the service providers to first collect the spatio-temporal infectious diseaserelated information from the internet and official reports using the aforementioned methods the service providers can then extract meaningful information about the spread locationspathways and time of the infectious diseases which leads to various spatio-temporal disease spread levels based on these disease spread levels the service providers can customize the pandemic mode risk level for different regions eg states cities and provinces at different times for example if the disease spread level eg the density of infected people at a particular city is high the service providers can set the pandemic mode into high-risk level for a week as shown in fig 21  otherwise the pandemic mode level can be set at low-risk level 2 contact tracing after determining the risk levels of pandemic mode based on the infected movement data the service providers can broadcast the risk level notification through smartphones pandemic mode application afterwards the smartphones can perform contact tracing to help quickly discovering infected people for efficient outbreak containment 310  311  based on the risk level of the pandemic mode the smartphones can automatically trace contacts using certain sensors and wireless connections for example google and apple currently collaborate together to develop a contact tracing application utilizing bluetooth technology aiming to quickly detect the past contacts among mobile users in a close proximity 312  in this case the bluetooth is used to exchange beacon signals containing unique keys between two smartphones prior to storing these keys to the cloud server for infected people notification similarly the work in 313 develops a wireless sensor system to exchange beacon signals between a mobile device with other nearby mobile devices as its contact information in another work an epidemiological data collection scheme utilizing users smartphones is described in 314  specifically a users smartphone can be used as a sensor platform to collect high accurate information including users location activity level and contact history between the user and certain locations then a smartphonebased contact detection system leveraging the smartphones magnetometer history is investigated in 315  to determine the close contact the system measures the linear correlation between two smartphones magnetometer records inspired by the aforementioned works the smartphones can be utilized as crucial tools to implement contact tracing considering the current risk level of the pandemic mode activated by the service providers as illustrated in fig 21  in particular if the service providers activate low-risk level ie the current number of infected people and areas are small the smartphones can trace close contacts using cellular networks only in this case the pandemic mode application will disable certain sensors bluetooth and wi-fi by default however if high-risk level pandemic mode ie the current number of infected people and areas are big is activated the pandemic mode application will enable all of the wireless connections including bluetooth wi-fi and cellular network as well as relevant sensors automatically to trace contacts faster vi conclusion social distancing has been considered to be a crucial measure to prevent the spread of contagious diseases such as covid-19 in this article we have presented a comprehensive survey on how technologies can enable encourage and enforce social distancing firstly we have provided an overview of the social distancing discussed its effectiveness and proposed various practical social distancing scenarios where the technologies can be leveraged we have then presented and reviewed various technologies to encourage and facilitate social distancing measures for each technology we have provided an overview examined the state-of-the-art and discussed how it can be utilized in different social distancing scenarios finally we have discussed open issues in social distancing implementations and potential solutions to address these issues  impact of covid-19 on pediatric

committee leaders distributed a weblink to complete the survey in surveymonkey san mateo ca via email on april 7 2020 to all 77 program directors pds in the naspghan program director database table 1 one reminder was sent on april 13 2020 responses were collected through april 19 2020 respondents were directed to answer questions related to pediatric gastroenterology fellows and not to subspecialized advanced training fellows transplant hepatology neurogastroenterology interventional endoscopy etc descriptive statistics were used to analyze responses using excel microsoft redmond wa and surveymonkey software free text answers were abstracted and quoted directly or grouped in themes by the authors information about programs that did not respond was collected from the naspghan pd database fifty-one of 77 66 pds responded to the survey including pds from canada mexico and all regions of the united states forty-two programs 82 had 6 or fewer fellows across all 3 years and half were associated with freestanding childrens hospitals table 1 a large majority of pds 46 of 51 90 reported their area was under a stay-at-home order with median duration of 4 weeks at the time of their response pds were asked about fellows utilization of telehealth for outpatients before the covid-19 pandemic forty-nine 98 programs indicated they did not use telehealth in the pre-covid-19 era in the covid-19 era 39 76 of programs reported having fellows use telehealth of the programs that were engaging fellows in telehealth 33 estimated the number of telehealth visits per week per fellow with a median of 5 visits range 125 there was a variety of ways that faculty managed telehealth visits with fellows fig 1 some individual programs reported multiple methods counting programs who only indicated the fellow and attending were in the same room 14 of 51 27 were conducting visits with the attending present for the entire telehealth call for 22 of 51 43 programs fellows had stopped seeing patients in clinic fifteen of these 21 68 programs had fellows participating in telehealth and 7 programs fellows were not seeing outpatients in clinic or via telehealth the remaining 29 programs had continued having fellows see outpatients in-person and comments indicated these patients were selected urgent patient visits resulting in fewer visits for fellows eight of the 29 28 programs with fellows still seeing outpatients in clinic estimated fellows were seeing 1 to 2 patients per fellow per week and 29 programs 31 reported fellows seeing 3 to 6 patients in-person in clinic per week twenty-four of 29 programs 83 with fellows attending in-person clinics were also including fellows in telehealth when asked about fellows working on the inpatient hospital service 26 of 51 51 programs had reduced the number of on-site fellows seeing inpatients as follows including 14 of 51 27 cutting the number by 50 or more eight 16 of programs reported no significant changes in how fellows were engaging in inpatient rounds and consults but for most programs fellows were limiting in-person contact in various ways fig 2 in 26 52 programs fellows were not participating in endoscopy procedures call schedules were changed in 21 of 51 41 programs with comments about adjusting duties for fellows who were pregnant had other health conditions had childcare needs or had spouses working emergency department or intensive care unit shifts some pds noted they adjusted call schedules to allow fellows 2 weeks without call duties following a period of service modified backup call schedules or had fellows staying at home take call to allow rest for fellows on service three of six new york city-area programs reported that some of their fellows were redeployed to adult medicine teams and 2 of the remaining 3 commented expected any day now and awaiting redeployment of the 50 pds who responded to a question regarding changes in education resources 47 of 50 92 had started using online audiovideo virtual conference platforms for meetings or lectures 26 of 50 52 reported offering readings and 6 of 50 12 were using prerecorded lectures pds reported using the following educational resources naspghan curricular resources and videos american academy of pediatrics prep gi the naspghan bowel sounds podcast american college of gastroenterology online activities journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition cme activities abbott lectures crohn disease exclusion diet modules and the naspghan nutrition university n2u nutrition curriculum regarding bench laboratory research 14 of 51 27 programs reported they had no fellows involved in bench research of the remaining 37 33 89 programs reported their fellows were not going to the laboratory and were working from home table 2 for programs with fellows involved in clinical research 25 of programs reported no changes and 31 of 51 61 programs reported their institution had placed restrictions on clinical research table 2 pds were asked to share changes they felt were critical to their covid response responses were varied but reflected prior survey responses related to reduced interpersonal and patient exposure institution of telemedicine and adapting conferences and personal check-ins to virtual meetings supplemental digital content table pds also were asked what they were most interested to learn from other programs regarding covid fellowship changes supplemental digital content table themes that emerged included ensuring fellows readiness for independent care and credentialing safety and missed opportunities regarding endoscopy implementation of telemedicine and addressing fellow wellness pds who responded to this survey represent all regions of the united states and include some programs in canada and mexico although there may be relatively lower representation of programs from south atlantic and west south central regions and mexico the sizes of fellowships were similar between programs who responded and those who did not respond the impact of covid-19 on fellowship training is pervasive but to varying degrees regarding clinical duties including call inpatient service and outpatient visits and research activity restrictions regarding in-person clinical work were nearly universal and new models and methods have been used for engaging fellows in inpatient work with less physical contact with patients and colleagues including outpatient encounters using telehealth and learning using virtual conferences and online resources research activity in bench-based and clinical research has been restricted for most programs although pds from all regions of the united states canada and mexico reported changes due to covid-19 the timing of the viruss impact may depend on location and population only new york programs reported redeploying fellows to other clinical areas but some other programs in philadelphia baltimore and montreal indicated they had plans in place or were preparing for it at the time of their response the duration of the need for these responsive changes and future adaptations is unknown and this survey of pediatric gastroenterology pds echo questions that have been raised by educators in other specialties 6 the accreditation council of graduate medical educationacgme has issued some guidance to the us programs although recommendations for reducing clinical encounters or increasing the ability of trainees to work in new ways have not been firmly established 47 the accreditation body has not changed work-hour restrictions and has reiterated calls for adequate supervision training and provisions for safety in the work environment they also have recommended continued didactic training using web-based remote conferencing which our survey respondents are doing 4 the acgme accelerated its implementation of telemedicine guidance to make them effective from march 18 under these requirements residents and fellows are permitted to use telemedicine under direct supervision where the supervising physician andor patient is not physically present with the resident and the supervising physician is concurrently monitoring patient care through appropriate telecommunication technology 4 a clarification statement was however posted on march 20 stating we want to be clear that those residents and fellows who are capable of providing this service telemedicine with indirect supervision available or immediately available are covered under the indirect supervision requirements8 the post also reminds readers that graded supervision from direct to indirect is at the discretion of programs for typical care and indicates that decisions for implementing supervision of telehealth should be made at the program level pd respondents to our survey reported rapid but variable implementation of telehealth only 14 of 51 27 programs indicated the attending was present by video the whole time and 12 programs nearly 1 quarter of programs reported the attending did not staff the patient encounter until after the call was completed suggesting that no current clear path exists for attendings staffing fellows during telehealth the center for medicare and medicaid services has added an interim rule during this public health emergency that allows payment for services provided by teaching physicians as long as they are present during the key portions of the service using interactive telecommunications technology center for medicare and medicaid services defines interactive telecommunication as requiring real-time 2-way audio and video telecommunication 5 this rule includes supervision of telehealth visits conducted by a resident or fellow implementation of telehealth supervision practices is informed by the acgme by hospital and university guidance and by payors and pds should familiarize themselves with relevant policies rapid and wide uptake of telehealth may present new opportunities for appropriate clinical care and training applicable to existing telehealth practices teaching through apprenticeship and role modeling is the foundation of graduate medical education and telehealth should be no exception berg et al 9 recently published a playbook for rapid implementation of telehealth during the pandemic including best practices adapted from american academy of pediatrics and american medical association and specific applications in pediatric gastroenterology the acgme also has recognized the reduced clinical volume and potential for trainees not achieving recommended numbers of cases or procedures and has left decisions about determining whether a graduating residentfellow is prepared for unsupervised practice to pds with consideration of the programs clinical competency committee 4 pds for pediatric subspecialty fellowships received a letter on april 13 2020 from the american board of pediatrics with corollary guidance for pds as they submit verification of clinical competence forms for graduating fellows 10 that letter does specifically recommend additional clinical experiences for nonfinal year trainees to make up for lost opportunities in the covid era our study indicates pediatric gastroenterology fellows research activities have been curtailed with a disproportionate 89 of those involved in bench research not coming to the laboratory compared with 64 of programs reporting restrictions for fellows involved in clinical research whether scaling back research for fellows will translate into delayed progress is yet unknown but it does raise concerns about lost opportunities to generate the research that could allow timely completion of manuscripts or grants that drive early academic career development and which are needed as evidence of scholarly activity for graduation and board certification potential ways to keep research active during the covid-19 pandemic include redesigning studies to be less labor intensive having the ability for open communication regarding research progress prioritization of necessary outcomes considering alternative methods for collecting data and working remotely to work on outcomes data 1112 for some fellows reduced clinical workload and stalled research projects may present opportunities for alternative scholarly activities such as curriculum development retrospective studies and reviews that do not require presence in a laboratory or clinical encounters although some allowances for altered clinical training have been addressed by the acgme and american board of pediatrics the impact on scholarly activity requirements has not been addressed in detail the american board of medical specialties signed on to a statement of the coalition for physician accountability recognizing the extreme disruption to student resident and fellow training licensing and credentialing and will provide guidance for how to manage that impact 13 regulatory guidance that recognizes the disruption reinforces the importance of learner safety and supervision and underscores competency-based assessment is welcome however regulations only go so far to inform educators in the day-to-day adjustments to teaching and learning in our specialty especially in the setting of the current covid-19 pandemic residents and fellows are crucial in many settings especially for busy inpatient services adjusting staffing of inpatient service and on-call duties was a theme in our survey responses with consideration of limiting contact with patients and each other personal health risks childcare obligations and the potential for trainees to become ill or enter quarantine due to suspected exposure some respondents mentioned addressing fellow wellness and morale and the emotional toll on trainees merits attention 614 our survey is meant to inform and spur communication among pediatric gastroenterology fellowship directors and others so we can learn from each other about half of the programs in our study reported that fellows were no longer participating in endoscopy in the covid-19 era this is a tremendous loss of learning opportunities for skills that are integral to our subspecialty adapting to the needs to protect learners and coworkers and to conserve ppe likely drives this change and careful consideration is needed to readdress these concerns as assessments of risk and ppe supply change in the coming weeks and months to maximize educational value fellows can still be involved in the decision-making surrounding timing and type of procedures performed as well as interpretation of findings for actual cases in addition programs with endoscopy simulators can encourage fellows to practice their endoscopy skills assuming they can sanitize equipment and comply with social distancing guidance training in video capsule endoscopy or ph-impedance studies also can be considered if fellows have access to software with synchronous or asynchronous feedback from experienced supervisors curating and generating other educational activities related to endoscopy may be taken up by programs or perhaps through collaborative work of relevant naspghan committees including ours for programs more severely impacted with prolonged and pervasive disruption of face-to-face clinical and endoscopy training the threat to their capacity to train fellows to acceptable competency is chilling and may require special consideration to support those programs this report provides early information of the impact of covid-19 on the training of pediatric fellows although the covid-19 era has altered patient care and reduced opportunities for learning procedural skills development of other competencies can continue there is value in many online interactive and self-directed learning activities that help our fellows build knowledge including those listed by the pds in our survey multicenter or naspghan-facilitated efforts to offer online educational activities in addition to those already available 15 may help ease the burden on individual programs and educators there also is value in engaging fellows in divisional and institutional responses to covid-19 encouraging reflection and self-care and practicing telehealth to foster development of competencies in professionalism systems-based practice and adapted interpersonal and communication skills how long covid-19 will affect our typical training environment and practices remains unknown but with resourcefulness collaboration innovation and grace we are able to adapt and to carry on preparing our fellows for independent practice  understanding the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on well-being and virtual care for people living with dementia and care partners living in the community p roach zwiers  a charlton  a josephson cb patten sb ismail  z smith ee  the covid-19 pandemic has necessitated public health measures that have impacted the provision of care for people living with dementia and their families additionally the isolation that results from social distancing may be harming well-being for families as formal and informal supports become less accessible for those with living with dementia and experiencing agitation social distancing may be even harder to maintain or social distancing could potentially aggravate dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms to understand the lived experience of social and physical distancing during the covid-19 pandemic in canada we remotely interviewed 21 participants who normally attend a dementia specialty clinic in calgary alberta during a period where essential businesses were closed and healthcare had abruptly transitioned to telemedicine the impacts of the public health measures in response to the pandemic emerged in three main categories of experience 1 personal 2 health services and 3 health status of both person living with dementia and care partner this in-depth understanding of the needs and experiences of the pandemic for people living with dementia suggests that innovative means are urgently needed to facilitate provision of remote medicine and also social interaction and integration  with the emergence of covid-19 sars-cov-2 as a novel coronavirus in late 2019 a global pandemic has led to varying levels of social distancing restrictions across the world this includes restrictions on public gatherings the conduct of businesses the accessibility of healthcare and movement outside the home the unintended consequences of these measures may included disrupted routines for people living with dementia increased stress on care partners as they manage the demands of caring for someone living with dementia and difficulty satisfying essential needs such as obtaining groceries and medications without the typical social and health service support or support from personal networks these measures have the potential to cause social isolation which is increasingly recognized to be detrimental to overall well-being vernooij-dassen  jeon 2016 ward et al 2018 well-being requires deep and meaningful human connections health status above an expected baseline positive interpersonal expectations and a sense of self feeney  collins 2015  maintaining well-being is a key component of person-centered dementia care kitwood 1997  moreover the rapid move to virtual care provision may influence how and when people access treatment from healthcare providers in addition to how providers can continue to provide high quality care in new virtual settings multiple professional organizations including alzheimers disease international 2020 have issued emergent covid-related advice for persons with living with dementia but so far these recommendations have been based on little evidence rarely collected systematicallyto begin building an evidence base for the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on well-being and healthcare of persons living with dementia we conducted a qualitative study of persons living with dementia and care partners receiving community-based care at a dementia specialty clinic a qualitative approach was used to collect rich data on lived experience that incorporated a reflexive thematic approach to content analysis we completed remote in depth interviews using telephone with family members or care partners as well as the person with dementia if they wished to and were able to provide consent in order for participants to provide detail on the changes and impacts of the pandemic on their lives it is important that these data ae collected while the pandemic is occurring and while social distancing measures are in place likely through a community network for younger people living with dementia the calgary cognitive neurosciences clinic operates out of two large tertiary-care sites in calgary alberta canada it is the only dementia speciality clinic in southern alberta with a catchment area of approximately 15 million patients are referred by a primary care provider and assessed for cognitive impairment and dementia by a staff of nurses and either a cognitive neurologist or psychiatrist in alberta there is universal government funding for physician visits and diagnostic testing prompt was established in the clinic in 2010 to investigate patient outcomes additional details on prompt design have been published previously sheikh et al 2018  all patients seen at the clinic are eligible to participate and enrol in prompt participation includes the opportunity to provide consent to be contacted for future research consent was obtained using qualtrics survey software qualtrics 2019 or explicit oral consent due to the nature of some of the clinic populations explicit oral consent was necessary so that participants who wanted to participate but perhaps did not have access to the internet email or who had disablements preventing them from using devices or computer screens could still be included explicit oral consent provided a way to ethically include a diverse population process consent dewing 2007 was used throughout the project where all participants provided verbal assent at every research encounter including the initial call to introduce the project and any subsequent contact including interviews to ensure that the participants were comfortable participating at that day or time options of telephone or zoom interviews were used as a technological tool to complete the interviews in order to adhere to social distancing mandates put in place in the province of alberta when the public state of emergency was declared on march 17 2020 potential participants were then contacted by telephone and informed of the project after which information sheets and consent forms were emailed or mailed to interested participants who had a minimum of 24 hours to consider the information and discuss it with family members or health providers before providing consent to participate and the interview is scheduled this study was approved by the conjoint human research ethics board at the university of calgary reb20-0559 in depth interviews were used as they are an appropriate way to gain a robust understanding of lived experience and allow for exploration of topics that are important to the participant maintaining a participatory approach to working with people living with dementia and care partners an interview guide was created asking general questions about experiences of isolation due to the pandemic and virtual health care experiences and was tested and updated after the first two interviews to act as pilots it was anticipated that theoretical saturation of participant experiences would be achieved after completion of 15-20 interviews and so a target of recruiting 20 participants was initially determined in depth interviews were audio-recorded and field notes were taken during the interviews in a dedicated field journal along with reflexive field notes written directly after the interviews demographic data was also recorded and was available through the current registry and information on whether the participants had contracted covid-19 or were tested for sars-cov 2 was collected by interview to collect the planned sample size of 20 completed interviews we contacted 45 people of whom 21 consented and completed the interview interviews ranged in duration from 8m33s to 34m38s mean length  21m12s and all interviews were completed over the phone as per participant request interviews were conducted between april 23 and may 21 2020 with recruitment and data collection completed by kf az and ec all research staff with extensive experience working with people living with dementia the interviewers were unknown to the participants at the time of interview but introduced themselves and the reason for the work at initial contact and at the time of interview in canada provincial governments are primarily responsible for implementing public health measures for pandemics a timeline of provincial measures for social distancing and health system reorganization was created by review of public records of the city of calgary and government of alberta communications from alberta health services the single public  audio recordings were transcribed verbatim using a secure professional transcribing service and anonymized and verified by the research team transcripts and field notes were managed using nvivo 12 qsr international 2018 for the qualitative analysis and data management interviews were transcribed concurrently while data collection was still occurring so that generated themes could be discussed at subsequent interviews to achieve theoretical saturation immersion in the qualitative data was the first step of data analysis transcripts were read and reread while the interview recordings are replayed a reflexive thematic analysis braun et al 2016 clarke et al 2019 was used to analyse the interview and field note data reflexive thematic analysis positions the researcher as a mechanism in the production of the analysis this form of analysis also requires a cognizance of theoretical assumptions that centers the experience of the person living with dementia and care partner and their experiences within the data and the analytical process analytical thoughts and iterative analyses were captured using memos and annotations disagreements over analyses and emergent themes were resolved via team discussion themes and subthemes were brought back to the participants for member checking and to enhance qualitative rigor and establish trustworthiness of the data lincoln  guba 1985  there were 20 dyads of persons living with dementia and care partners in 18 cases the persons living with dementia declined to participate but the care partner participated and in one case the person living with dementia and care partner each participated on their own diagnoses and last folstein mini mental status examination folstein et al 1975 scores for the persons with dementia are shown in table 1  no participants reported a diagnosis of covid-19 for anyone living in their household two care partner participants suspected they may have had covid-19 due to symptoms but were not tested and a third care partner participant reported being told to isolate due to being in a high risk group of complication from covid-19  through the completion of the qualitative analysis with coding and synthesis completed by az ec and directed by pr principal investigator and qualitative methods expert three overarching themes emerged from the data see table 2  that clearly demonstrated the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on experiences of cognitive neuroscience patients and their care partners the themes built on a coding tree that started with small descriptive codes about discrete areas of day to day life and were then synthesized to larger descriptions of experience these themes are

community or by family members was crucial for many people who were anxious or afraid to leave the house for essentials those participants who had family support reinforced these messages the first time we did something at the superstore we put in a pick-up order i dont have a cell phone i have a computer but not a cell phone so my daughter said you know you put your order in and then ill go over and pick it up when its ready she would do that for me and we social distanced the whole time like shed drive up in the driveway participant 123 care partner managing day to day activities many care partners reported stress around coping with day to day activities of living and some of this stress was due to no longer having the formal home care service they had been receiving before the pandemic and shut down of services  the personal impact of the pandemic and associated public health measures is closely associated to the health services impact of these same measures participants reported feeling alone and unsupported in many cases and were largely understanding of the need for health services to focus on the pandemic response it was also clear however that some degree of ongoing contact was crucial for continuing to support families living with dementia thats kind of what i feel is youre just on your owni havent heard from anyone i finally phoned someone the other day

every day of the program we always hear from them over the phone yeah participant 111 care partner due to the scale of immediate shift to social and physical distancing health care providers and patients had to quickly adapt to remote delivery of care in a virtual medicine format overall many participants expressed that although they prefer face to face appointments with their care team there were perceived advantages to receiving care in a remote format these included not feeling as rushed having options presented such as telephone vs zoom and care partners expressed an ability to be more

was in the room or wanted to be part of the call there was less opportunity for frank one on one conversations with the doctor and that this could be potentially distressing for the person living with dementia depending on the nature of the discussion participants also expressed some concern with technological barriers of connecting via internet and while recognizing that body language and non-verbal communication was important to the appointment support is necessary for people who are unfamiliar with the technology to be able to fully participate in this way  participants described feeling anxiety about the pandemic in general and about needing to leave the house both personally and perceived anxiety on the part of the person living with dementia this highlights the need to be

more cognitive decline since the start of the public health measures during the covid-19 pandemic these concerns were focused around the decrease in social interaction impacting the progress and severity of cognitive decline which was perceived as progressing more rapidly the previous two months  many care partners expressed feeling as though they could not cope on their own with limited access to both formal and informal supports the changes to the health systems and services provided described in the section above have effects on the amount of burnout expressed by family members and care partners participants also worried about returning to work if the services that enabled them to do so pre-pandemic were not reinstated  this study provides early evidence of the impact of covid-19 on persons living with dementia and their care partners these interviews identified multiple adverse consequences of the public health measures implemented to contain spread of sars-cov-2 including loss of informal caregiving lack of access to health care and social isolation contributing to burn out symptoms among care partners this validates the concerns expressed by multiple advocacy organizations such as the alzheimer society of canada alzheimers association usa and alzheimers disease international which although well founded have nonetheless been based on anecdotes or speculation without data collected directly from persons living with dementia our data were collected during a period of lockdown when all non-essential businesses were closed health clinic access was mandated to be online or telephone except for emergencies and most in-person home care services were no longer being provided therefore it provides a snapshot of the adverse effects of the aggressive public health efforts that were needed to flatten the curve to prevent health system collapse these drastic public health measures while being lightened in many jurisdictions may yet be required in other countries at an earlier stage of the pandemic or in case of a second wave of viral infections in the northern hemisphere in the fall so far there are few data on the impact of covid-19 on dementia care even though it is well understood that older people with medical comorbidities are at much higher risk of fatal infection in a letter in the lancet physicians from wuhan province cited

particularly among care partners of persons with more moderate to severe dementia we identified multiple impacts on well-being of people living with dementia and their family members andor care

well-being and functioning of families of persons living with dementia phinney 2006 phinney et al 2007 roach  drummond 2014 roach et al 2016  care partners expressed concerns that cognitive decline accelerated during social distancing this is consistent with literature finding that loneliness can be detrimental to well-being and quality of life moyle et al 2011 and increase the risk of mortality and morbidity luo et al 2012 tilvis et al 2012  social interaction can be beneficial for cognitive functioning vernooij-dassen  jeon 2016 and so it is plausible that social isolation could provoke accelerated cognitive decline and or an exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on mental health is increasingly recognized armitage  nellums 2020 holmes et al 2020  these mental health impacts may be compounded when care partners no longer have access to formal and informal supports that provide respite help with hygiene medication day to day activities of living and essential tasks such as shopping for groceries or collecting medications moreover the challenges of assisting a person living with dementia to navigate changing public spaces where physical distancing wearing of masks and controlled movements are necessary leads to additional stress for the care partner and greater risk for the person living with dementia participants were understanding of these measures but at the same time expressed concern for their own ability to continue to cope on a long-term basis and the possibility of burnout without these supports this echoes general concern of burnout by families living with dementia in times before the covid-19 pandemic brodaty  donkin 2009 srenson  conwell 2011 takai et al 2009  but with these caring demands now amplified by isolation and anxiety with the accompanying sudden shift to virtual care by almost all health care teams there was additional anxiety experienced with regards to the

distance meal or medication collection and delivery at a safe distance or with the appropriate personal protective equipment and flexibility on maximum limits for dispensing medications to the reduce the number of needed trips to the pharmacy delivering high quality telemedicine will be essential to ensuring good health during a time of social distancing it was evident in the data that if patients and care partners are expected to connect with internet technology clear guidance should be provided to explain how to set up and use technology that may be unfamiliar to many the ability for a care partner to provide confidential information to a clinical care team in advance of a scheduled virtual appointment was also expressed particularly when the care partner wished to notify the medical team of symptoms that are potentially distressing or humiliating to the patient or could lead to conflict to address this need our clinic is implementing secure web-based surveys that will allow the care partner to confidentially report neurobehavioural symptoms function and caregiver burden using validated scales with separate telemedicine appointments with the care partner as necessary this work leverages data systems employed to capture patient data in the prompt registry demonstrating another use of clinical patient registries for meaningful patient engagement and service improvement

street et al 2009 and we can reasonably extrapolate that this would be true during times of social and physical distancing as experienced during the covid-19 pandemic strengths of the study include that it was embedded in a prospective clinic registry which enabled us to quickly contact people living with dementia and their care partners during the covid-19 pandemic and link their data to

a barrier to communication however the themes that emerged from our work accord with the concerns expressed by multiple advocacy groups expert opinion brown et al 2020  and the early observations of dementia specialists in wuhan province wang et al 2020  therefore we expect that most of the themes are universal and not idiosyncratic to our practice setting by design we did not include persons living with dementia who are residing in care homes or who are hospitalized in acute care additional research is needed on these important populations this work is limited to the impacts of the initial public health response to the covid-19 pandemic and it will be useful to continue additional qualitative work to better understand the impact on different groups over time as the public health response evolves and society adapts to the changes this in-depth understanding of the lived impact of decreased social engagement and healthcare access on personal well-being can inform future health

benoit mulsant h   the workup and diagnosis of adrd is vulnerable to disruption in several ways as primary care providers and specialists are being redeployed to address medical emergencies these physicians are not available to work up neurocognitive disorders attending a clinic for one or more appointments and visits for blood work and neuroimaging expose frail individuals to risks that may exceed the benefits of timely evaluation and regular monitoring in many jurisdictions outpatient physicians have transitioned to providing virtual care completing assessments and follow-ups by telephone or videoconferencing these modalities may not be adequate to perform the physical and neurological examinations or some of the cognitive tests required when diagnosing mci or dementia or monitoring their progression in some cases it may be possible to provide an initial visit in person and follow-ups remotely otherwise diagnosis and care may have to be deferred or limited the use of anticholinesterase inhibitors and memantine is common in patients with adrd medications frequently used for the treatment of bpsd include antipsychotic antidepressant antiepileptic and other psychotropic medications11 patients who are stable on medications may be impacted if the supply of their medication is disrupted due to missed visits disruption of pharmacy pickup or delivery or supply chain problems initiating a new medication during the pandemic may be associated with higher risk particularly if components of routine screening are disrupted such as in-person clinical assessments blood work or electrocardiogram or the ability to follow up on adverse events in a timely manner rare but serious adverse events associated with mediations used in the treatment of adrd and bpsdeg bradycardia gastrointestinal symptoms falls fractures cardiovascular events or strokescarry higher morbidity and mortality if access to urgent care is impeded in the context of social isolation individuals with adrd who rely on family or health professionals for reminders or assistance with taking their medications are at risk for sudden discontinuation of medications the risk-benefit ratio of some medications in dementia may shift towards harm if adequate prescribing and monitoring is not possible common non-pharmacologic interventions for adrd in general and bpsd in particular involve social and physical contact such as social groups exercise groups and pet therapy a limitation on resources and a need for physical distancing will not merely suspend these interventions it will also result in increased isolation a lack of physical exercise decreased social engagement and a suspension of purposeful activity while confined at home many people are now using technology to socialize and even exercise in group individuals with adrd may not be able to use electronic tools and software see below resolution of the pandemic may be associated with an increased demand for care that was deferred individuals with adrd and their family may also need assistance to resume care and address complications that arose from the lack of follow-up and monitoring or from the disruption in health-promoting interventions3
impact of societal responses to covid-19 in different adrd care settings

 the societal response to the pandemic includes travel restrictions and home confinement lockdowns people are encouraged or required to isolate socially and not to leave their home non-essential businesses are shut down the extent and duration of these social distancing measures is uncertain but it may be significant and prolonged in some jurisdictions in this context many resources upon which patients with adrd depend may become unavailable depending on the severity of their illness individuals with adrd live in various settings and rely on the availability and accessibility of various resources in the context of the covid-19 pandemic these settings may influence both the risk and impact of societal consequences of covid-19 most individuals with milder adrd have minimal care needs and live in the community where they may have established robust supports however their ability to live in the community may be threatened if it depends on services that are disrupted by the pandemic delivery services such as meals on wheels may be delayed or disrupted due to increased demand closures or supply chain failures family or professional caregivers eg home health care workers providing in-home support for activities of daily living can also become unavailable due to increased demand workers illness or required isolation due to exposure some workers may also be prevented by their employer from working in multiple settings individuals with adrd living in the community may be particularly vulnerable if they are unable to seek help should they fall ill covid-19 can be associated with a sudden deterioration of respiratory status and cardiac complications12 thus symptomatic patients require frequent check-ins while maintaining physical distance many individuals with adrd who rely on personal savings and investments are also at risk of financial adversity due to the economic consequences of the pandemic as younger people they may need to access government programs for financial support also they are less likely to drive a personal vehicle13 instead relying on mass transit or transportation services that increase their exposure and risk of infection they may benefit from assistance in identifying safe means of transportation and in reducing their need to leave home by facilitating deliveries and deferring non-essential travel those living alone in the community may also suffer from loneliness due to increased isolation and disruption of group activities creative ideas to incorporate alternative social physical activities safely within the home are needed whereas people are turning to technology to stay socially connected and access services including health care some individuals with adrd may have trouble using technology due to cognitive impairment they need instruction and support to use of these tools as with any disaster individuals with adrd and their family need to make contingency plans for the provision of essential services families and caregivers awareness of the potential risks and disruptions described above for patients with adrd living in the community may help mitigate their impact potential mitigation strategies include increased support in the form of more frequent contact by telephone or video chat problem solving to maintain delivery and caregivers services planning for potential disruption or temporarily moving to a location where the required supports can be provided paradoxically some families may be able to temporarily provide support at home because they are unable to work due to lockdowns or other restrictions many of the issues faced by individuals with adrd in the community also apply to those living in group and assisted living environments in some cases the increased risk of infection associated with large groups may shift the risk-benefit ratio towards returning to ones home if it is an option however many individuals with adrd require a supportive living environment because of a decreased level of functioning in these settings physical touching and toileting crowding and shared rooms and staff working in multiple settings may further increase the risk of covid-19 transmission as discussed above features of moderate to severe dementia such as severe memory impairment and bpsd such as wandering and agitation may thwart attempts to promote the actions recommended to reduce risk of transmission in the other direction imposition of increased hand hygiene isolation or restriction of visitors and activities may worsen cognitive symptoms or bpsd increasing further care needs and risks individuals with adrd living in long term care ltc nursing homes face all the challenges of those in supportive living environments and additional risks their higher dependence on caregivers and health care providers eliminates the possibility of physical distancing in these settings personal protective equipment ppe may be rationed for confirmed or suspected cases or even become unavailable9 when covid-19 affects ltc homes it can have a high attack rate and case fatality ratefor example a case fatality rate of 33734 fatalities among 101 affected residentshas been reported in a washington state ltc14 this home also experienced a significant disruption to staffing with 50 health care workers reported to be infected14 many staff of ltc work at multiple facilities or in private homes increasing the risk of transmission and disruption of care beyond an impacted facility patients with adrd are hospitalized due to bpsd comorbid illness or inability to care for themselves and lack of access to supportive services or ltc15 hospitals present the same risks as ltc with additional risks hospital staff and physicians are highly vulnerable to contracting covid-19 of the first 48548 confirmed cases in china as of february 14 2020 1716 37 were health care workers and professionals2 as were 2026 90 of the first 22512 confirmed cases in italy as of march 15 20203 the risk of covid-19 nosocomial infection is high due to high staff ratios and turnover high patient volumes crowded rooms rapid inflow of detected and undetected cases of covid-19 and constrained supply of ppe for reasons discussed above age comorbidities behavioral and cognitive problems individuals with adrd are among those at highest risk of nosocomial infection in many communities affected by covid-19 hospitals get strained or overwhelmed9 hospitalized individuals with adrd may be particularly affected because they are less able to monitor their care or advocate for themselves decreased nursing time has been shown to be associated with increased medical errors and adverse events in dementia16
 the need for hospitalization implies a more severe illness patients with severe bpsd may be at even higher risk for the behaviours discussed above that elevate transmission of infection on a south korean psychiatric ward 101 of 103 inpatients were infected and 7 died during a covid19 outbreak17 upon admission hospitals need to evaluate the risk to individuals with adrd and the risk to others in the context of potential suspected or confirmed cases of covid-19 planning for these situations is needed to clarify the ethical issues local legal framework and institutional policies that impact a decision with respect to the need for and use of locked seclusion chemical and physical restraints and end of life or palliative care in high risk situations18 regardless of choices made by patients with adrd or their family members health care interventions taken for granted may have to be rationed in some jurisdictions affected by the pandemic see below in addition to the usual settings in which patients with adrd receive care the pandemic will force some patients into unexpected and suboptimal environments with their own challenges hospitals dealing with or preparing for a surge in covid-19 patients are discharging or diverting some patients with milder cases to hotels convention centres tents and shipping containers19 while the physical needs of some medically stable patients with adrd may be met in these alternative settings their cognitive and behavioral needs may not during the pandemic the perennial lack of availability of safe and adequate housing options for individuals with adrd combined with an unprecedented strain on medical and social resources could create its own crisis leading to unprecedented levels of morbidity and mortality in this frail population4
impact of covid-19 on caregivers and physicians of individuals with adrd

 as most patients with adrd depend on caregivers the impact of the pandemic on formal and informal caregivers need to be considered in the best of time the physical and mental health of some caregivers is precarious20 during this pandemic some caregivers may become ill they may need to isolate and be unavailable or they may develop anxiety and other mental health issues as discussed above due to the sudden unavailability of established services family members may have to become caregivers for a relative with adrd grief and its consequences are likely in family caregivers who have lost a loved one21 and in professional caregivers who have lost a patient22 all of the above will lead to exhaustion and burnout as discussed above specific aspects of caring for individuals with adrd are incompatible with physical distancing inadequate or unavailable ppe or training related to its use sets the stage for viral transmission responding to agitation and threats of violence typically requires urgent interventions that impede proper ppe use and increase further the risk of viral exposure23
 many patients with adrd have do not resuscitate status including advanced directives not to transfer them to an acute medical floor as a result in some settings if these patients develop covid-19 neurologists geriatricians geriatric psychiatrists or primary care providers will have to practice out of their scope and care managing the symptoms and distress associated with pneumonia however this issue goes beyond covid-19 and pneumonia as discussed above during this pandemic many patients with adrd who want to receive the full spectrum of care including intensive care and intubation may not be able to access optimal acute care for any medical issue not just covid-19 all physicians may have to treat a variety of medical issues that would have otherwise been treated by specialists preparatory discussions with patients and family members are needed to clarify the goals of care should these dire circumstances arise they are particularly crucial if advance discussion of code status have not yet occurred or are not clearly documented health care workers involved in adrd care are already exposed to suffering and deaths14 their stress and anxiety may be further increased by the current risk to their own safety the number of cases deaths and societal impact of covid-19 has already exceeded those observed during the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars as following sars we need to be prepared to address the serious and long-term mental effects of covid-19 on health care workers including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression24

mental hygiene trauma and stigma in the time of covid-19

 the covid-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt not the active care of individuals of adrd but also the basic routines that promote their mental health the pandemic and its social consequences may cause fear anxiety and anger they will disrupt all forms of social interaction possibly for a prolonged period of time a lack of physical closeness may lead to increased loneliness and sadness exercise is recommended generally and specifically for individuals with adrd and confinement reduces access to exercise sleep disturbances is common in adrd and sleep may be further disrupted due to anxiety and loss of social rhythms zeitgeists25 in turn lack of activities and sleep loss and stimulation may cause delirium in individuals with adrd contributing further to morbidity and mortality26
 like health care workers individuals with adrd may experience the loss of friends and family due to covid-19 these losses may lead to grief bereavement or frank depression a common feature of adrd27 the pandemic and its consequences may also be experienced as a trauma followed by post-traumatic stress disorder in turn stress and trauma can accelerate cognitive decline28 age illness depression trauma and dementia are all risk factors for suicide29
 during the pandemic individuals with adrd may be doubly stigmatized stigma is already a pervasive issue in adrd30 individuals with or at risk of exposure to covid-19 have been stigmatized31 risks of stigma include ostracization and denial of health and social services31 which comes at time of potential scarcity of resources to be allocated32 rationing raises triage issues beyond some of the logistical issues discussed above will older individuals with mild adrd be able to access intensive care beds if they are already on a ventilator will they be taken off to reallocate these scarce resources to younger patients how will these decisions be made ethically what will be the psychological impact of triage on health professionals a response to these complex questions is beyond the scope of this paper however some ethicists have proposed a framework to address these issues in the unprecedented context of the covid-19 pandemic32

covid-19 potential impact on adrd research threatens the patients of tomorrow

 the discussion above has focused exclusively on the immediate risks and impact of the covid-19 pandemic for individuals with adrd ie the patients of today this pandemic also threatens the patients of tomorrow researchers have already sounded the alarm on how the covid-19 pandemic may affect clinical research in unprecedented ways33

34 the consequences may be even more dire for adrd research over the past two decades adrd has become one of the most active areas of both basic and clinical research attracting major industry government and philanthropic funding in the western world as of march 31 2020 a search on clinicaltrialsgov as of march 29 2020 using the key words dementia or alzheimers disease reveals 592 active studies a recent published study of the same registry identified 156 trials including 42 phase-3 trials investigating 132 agents for the treatment of adrd and another 33 trials of 15 different devices35 abrupt interruption of all these research studies would not only jeopardize a crucial investment society has already made but it could also have long lasting consequences for the field of adrd research at the same time the covid-19 pandemic could be a welcome catalyst to accelerate the adoption of innovative design and methods in clinical research33 fundamentally changing the way participants in trials for adrd are recruited and assessed the rest of this section discusses whether and how adrd clinical research can continue during the pandemic as per the declaration of helsinki concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interest of science and society36 therefore all research activities such as observational studies in which participants are exposed a potentially lethal infection eg through face-to-face contact with research staff without the possibility of any direct benefit should be suspended unless they can be continued entirely remotely33 when participation in a study entails provision of essential medical care eg an intervention that is only available through a research trial continuation of the study should be considered with the maximum possible mitigation of the risk of infection34 the us food and drug administration fda has issued some guidance regarding continuation of research participation for intervention studies and how to mitigate the risks to participants and to the integrity of the research studies during the pandemic37
 research activities have been and remain critical in advancing medical knowledge and alleviating the suffering for millions of future patients34 particularly in the field of adrd for which no new medication has been approved since 2003 clinical investigators can explore creative ways to continue their studies while mitigating the risk of covid-19 infection both for research participants and staff this may require modification of study protocols to collect safety and endpoint assessments remotely some assessments eg follow-up neuroimaging for a secondary outcome may need to be deferred or missed challenges in terms of selective retention measurement errors data missing not at random and other confounds will need to be addressed in the analyses and reporting of the results when a study cannot be done entirely remotely because it requires in-person visits eg a trial requiring regular monitoring of safety lab tests the increased risk of participation associated with in-person visits needs to be discussed explicitly with participantsor in the cases of most studies involving participants with moderate to severe adrd their substitute decision maker sdm the established relationship between participants or their sdms and the research staff will facilitate these discussions institutional review boards irbs and data and safety management boards dsmbs would also need to be involved in reassessing the riskbenefit ratio of continuing participation in these studies a few clinical trials may consider not just to continue following and monitoring current participants but also to recruit new participants except for some rare trials of purely psychosocial interventions baseline assessments and safety lab tests would require in-person visits again this would require the involvement of the irb and dsmb and careful discussion with possible participants or their sdm and documentation of this consent process as with any major crisis the covid-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the way all clinical research including adrd research is carried out the current challenging situation is forcing researchers to think how they could conduct most research procedures remotely it will accelerate the adoption of technologies and tools that permit remote assessments38 39 40
 in the field of adrd research we believe it will impact most the traditional neuropsychological and functional assessments on which most primary outcomes for adrd interventions trials are based41 in the long term adrd research will also benefit from these technological innovations because they should allow the recruitment and follow-up of much larger samples at reduced costs finally the covid-19 crisis may expedite the development of non-pharmacological interventions that can be delivered the home of participant eg home-based cognitive training or physical exercise or that use small portable devices that can be easily used in private homes eg transcranial direct current stimulation and similar devices40
 the covid-19 pandemic is disrupting the world and its health care systems in unprecedented ways this pandemic also threatens the integrity and viability of current and future adrd research local impact will vary and evolve depending on specific factors including the incidence of covid-19 the associated death rates the availability of resources and the societal changes implemented to control the pandemic these local variations combined with the heterogeneity of adrd make simple generic recommendations ineffectual however awareness of this possible impact and mitigation strategies adapted to individual and local circumstances may prevent or reduce the harm of this pandemic and its consequences for persons with adrd and their caregivers eric brown substantial contributions to the

response to covid-19 policies grant mckenzie benjamin adams  the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease in late 2019 and subsequent pandemic led to an immense disruption in the daily lives of almost everyone on the planet faced with the consequences of inaction most national governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by their inhabitants as schools and businesses shuttered the mobility of these people decreased this reduction in mobility and related activities was recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices patterns emerged that varied by place-based activity in this work the differences in these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations specifically focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns we show that peoples activity response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within them three assessment measures are devised and the results correlate with a number of global indices we discuss these findings and the relationship between government action and residents response  the emergence and global spread of the novel coronavirus disease  caused by the sars-cov-2 virus will have a lasting impact on human life in late 2019 the disease was identified in wuhan china and quickly spread across the globe 1  nations responded in a variety of ways as cases of the disease increased dramatically within their populations some governments responded immediately severely restricting residents mobility and pausing most economic activity 2 while others chose to implement less restrictive policies 3  across the globe borders began to close and many national governments chose to close schools and businesses essentially shutting down local economies while others limited their response to simple physical distancing practices 4  the speed at which countries responded to this pandemic also varied drastically with some governments taking action within days of their first confirmed cases and others waiting to implement public health policies until a pattern could be identified still other governments have yet to instrument meaningful covid-19-related policy choosing instead to make an argument for herd immunity 5  at the heart of the pandemic however are the inhabitants of these different countries people look to their government for information on the severity and spread of the disease and rely on what they are told to make informed decisions on how to act for most government enacted policies dictate how they will conduct their daily affairs during a global health emergency as officials around the world began to cancel public events and limit public transit options inhabitants were forced to respond by limiting their mobility and changing their activity behavior a decade ago this change in community mobility would have been measured at a large scale through survey samples of the population today however this change in activity behavior is being monitored and recorded in real-time through context-aware technology the ubiquity of location-enabled mobile devices means that mobile device manufacturers eg apple google and data providers eg verizon deutsche telekom have unlocked access to the mobility activity of people around the planet to a degree previously unattainable during this crisis a few of these companies have offered limited public access to anonymized aggregations of this data apple for example is reporting a decrease in human mobility globally based on route searches performed by users of their maps platform over the past few month 6  in some instances route queries have dropped below 80 of their baseline suggesting that a significant amount of users have reduced their mobility due to the pandemic similar results have been released by the descartes lab an analytics company for counties in the united states 7  aside from purely spatial movement data other companies have focused on discrete places using location-enabled mobile device data to identify the types of places eg bank grocery store restaurant people visit and how their visiting behavior has changed over the past few months for instance foursquare 8 has demonstrated the impact of covid-19 on place-based social media check-ins within the united states 1 and safegraph 9 is publishing similar data based on a panel of location-based mobile surveys aside from the apple maps data however the vast majority of data published on changes in human activity behavior has focused exclusively on the united states in this work we are interested in how the residents of different countries respond to their governments policies related to covid-19 therefore identifying the place-based activity responses of people from a range of countries is essential with this goal in mind we make use of the google community mobility dataset this dataset is an aggregate of the place-based activity behavior of millions of individuals as collected through their location-enabled mobile devices if a mobile device user has google location services enabled required when using the google maps application their location data is anonymously collected aggregated with other users across a region eg country or district and reported in one of six place type categories further information on these categories is discussed in section 31 not only are these data based on one of the most widely used location-based services on the planet but the data is also passively collected thus reducing the bias of the mobility patterns as compared to active collection such as surveys or check-ins 10  for the purposes of this research this data is an ideal representation of activity response to the covid-19 pandemic and forms the foundation on which we conduct our analysis as of early may 2020 time of writing most governments have responded to the crisis to the degree they are likely to and we are currently observing many governments announce plans to lift lock-downs relax mobility restrictions and re-open their economies now is an opportune time to examine the relationship between government action and resident response with respect to place-based activities understanding how residents of certain countries responded to their government in a time of crisis is essential for predicting how people may react in future crises and exposing the dynamic between politicians and their constituents in difficult times it also 1 httpsvisitdataorgindexhtml helps us to identify which countries respond to crises in similar or different ways with these objectives in mind our analysis focuses on developing three assessment measures on which to compare and contrast countries through their response to the covid-19 pandemic these assessment measures will be developed by addressing the following five research questions rq is there a quantifiable relationship between the policies enacted by a countrys government and the place-based activity response from their inhabitants for instance is the magnitude of policy action mirrored by the magnitude of activity response do countries differ in their responses this question helps us understand whether the changes in activity patterns that we see world-wide are actually due to the imposition of government policies or perhaps due to some other reason eg international media the differences between countries give insight into differences among governments in their ability to enact the envisioned policies rq2 which of the six place-based activity categories as reported by google are most affected by policy action do these remain consistent between countries this helps us to identify which policies are most effective for influencing human behavior in order to limit the spread of covid-19 and also which policies are less effective since limiting different kinds of activities will lead to different economic outcomes better understanding this relationship helps us optimize our responses for the desired outcome rq3 is there a measurable temporal lag between policy enactment and activity response if so does this lag vary between countries during an exponential growth phase of a disease such as covid-19 a delay of just a few days can make a large difference in the outcome understanding temporal lags between policy enactment and activity response is critical to inform policy-makers who are trying to quickly enact social distancing policies rq4 does an increase in activity pattern variability within a country at the subnational level correlate with a decrease in similarity to government response rq1 this helps us to understand whether a unified national response is more or less effective than one that is managed by regional and local governments rq5 how does the relationship between government policy action and place-based activity response correlate with global indices such as the development index or corruption perception index this last research question gives some insight into whether there are distal causes based on the socio-economic and political conditions within countries that influence how place-based activity manifests under government imposed lockdown conditions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss existing work on this topic and related topics an overview of the data used in this analysis is presented in section 3 section 4 presents the methodology used in developing the assessment measures and showcases how these measures can be applied to compare and contrast nations this is followed by section 5 where we compare our three assessment measures with existing global indices finally our findings are discussed in section 6 and future work and conclusions are presented to the reader we are still in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic a burgeoning domain of biomedical research has developed around the virus itself with many researchers just now beginning 3 to study the global societal impacts of the disease much of the emerging peer-reviewed work has focused on the regions with early outbreaks one such study by kraemer et al 11 studied the correlation between real-time mobility data from the internet service company baidu and the spread of the disease in wuhan china the authors found that once the national government established control measures the correlation decreased substantially further work on the transmission rate of the disease found that travel restrictions enacted by the government delayed the epidemic progression by 3-5 days within china but significantly slowed the spread elsewhere in the world 12 pointing to the global impacts of the policy actions taken by a single country much of the response research being conducted on covid-19 is still in its infancy but we can look to other recent global events to understand how nations and their people respond there is an existing body of literature exploring the impact of natural disasters 13  terrorism 14  and economic crises 15 on human mobility and activity patterns most of these studies define human mobility at the scale of migration between localized regions and little research has explored the day-to-day impact on the mobility of individuals or groups at a multi-national level brought about by a global crisis in attempting to find parallels to the current pandemic we turn to research on the response to previous global pandemics there have been a series of studies that explore the impact of human movement on the spread of diseases including influenza 16  ebola 17 18  and infectious diseases in general 19  many of these studies make use of local population datasets including mobile device call detail records cdrs location histories and the results of travelmobility surveys for instance dallatomasina et al 20 used cellphone records to track the transmission of ebola in rural west africa with some success early research out of brazil has shown this methodology to be useful in tracking the spread of covid-19 21  much of this work is a precursor to mobile device-based contact tracing applications that are currently in the works 22  few studies however have had access to the breadth or volume of data now being collected and published by private technology companies as a response to this specific pandemic as companies release their data to researchers a growing body of work is emerging related to covid-19 mobility response the vast majority of this work is focused in the united states with very limited work concentrated at the global scale visualization tools for supporting analytics have been a target for many researchers 23 24  other efforts have investigated the relationship between political views and compliance with government policy 25 26  us-focused research has also demonstrated that government policy that limits every day life has been shown to be having an impact on many sectors of the economy 27  a recent study of high school students suggested that school closures and concerns over covid-19 are significantly impacting performance of students in their subject areas 28 and will continue to have a lasting impact on our education system while limited data is available similar educational and economic impacts are also being found outside of the united states 29  similar work to what we present here has investigated certain economic factors that contribute to a change in place-based activity patterns also using google community mobility patterns 30 31  these efforts however did not look at government policy as a whole or the correlation of response over time other researchers have used this data to predict specific countrylevel responses in the future 32 33  to the best of our knowledge no research has investigated the relationship between government policy action and place-based activity response at the scale we present here or using the range of methods we propose the data used in these analyses are publicly available for reproducibility links to data sources have been provided as footnotes where appropriate data produced from our analysis are available at httpsplatialsciencecovid19code in early april 2020 google began publishing static reports showing daily change in activity patterns starting from february 15th 34  these reports which google call their community mobility reports 2 present plots containing daily percentage change from baseline baseline being january 3-february 6 2020 for six activity categories in 129 countries the place types that contribute to these activity categories were determined by google and labeled as grocery  pharmacy parks transit stations retail  recreation residential workplaces brief descriptions of these categories are available in the google community mobility documentation 3 in late april google began providing the raw values for these data along side the original pdf reports for this study we are using activity reports that cover an eight week time period from february 15 to april 11 2020 the maximum baseline change in the negative direction was 100 and 497 in the positive direction an outlier due to a country-wide festival an example of these activity patterns are shown in figure 1 along with the stringency index for the country introduced in the next section  as nations around the world were faced with the spreading covid-19 pandemic their governments responded with a range of measures and policy decisions a team of researchers at the blavatnik school of government university of oxford developed a tool to track these measures and produce a response dataset 4 that allows national policy responses to be compared across a range of measures the key product of this coronavirus government response tracker is the stringency index this index is made of up 13 indicators of government response recorded daily for 149 countries nine of these indicators assign an ordinal value to policy action related to school closures travel bans public event cancellations etc the other three focus on financial or monetary measures the stringency index is calculated through a weighted combination of these indicators with a minimum value of 0 and maximum of 100 the index was calculated back to january 1 2020 and through to at least april 11 the end of our temporal analysis window the full methodology for how this stringency index was developed is available at 35  the dataset is currently being used in a range of preliminary covid-19 related analysis 36 37 38  finally we compare the results of our analysis to a number of other country-specific attributes and global indices the latest population counts areas and population densities for each country were accessed from geonamesorg 5 the number of confirmed cases and deaths due to covid-19 were downloaded from the world health organization coronavirus dashboard 6 two indices of global development were used the united nations human development index 39 and the world bank world development indicators 7 finally the results of our analysis were compared against the corruption perception index 40 and the world press freedom index published by reporters without borders 8  in this section we discuss the methodology used to assess the relationship between the stringency index representing a countrys government policy action and the place-based activity patterns recorded via mobile devices representing inhabitant response we establish three methods of assessing the response similarity in magnitude of response lag response time and subregional variability of the response two different methods cosine similarity and pearson correlation were initially used in addressing rq1-assessment of the similarities between the stringency index and activity patterns the cosine similarity approach views both sets of data as a set of vectors measuring the cosine of the angle between each pair and producing a similarity value bounded between 0 and 1 while both cosine similarity and pearsons correlation are fundamentally variations on the inner product they vary based on centering for our purposes cosine similarity is the most appropriate method for comparing activity patterns to government policy over time due to the fact that it is not invariant to shifts a feature that is not true for pearsons correlation we will use both of these approaches however for assessing similarity and report later on the correlation given our hypothesis that activity patterns decrease over time in response to an increase in the stringency index we first inverted five of the six mobility patterns namely retail  recreation grocery  pharmacy workplace transit stations and parks in order to conduct similarity assessment as opposed to dissimilarity these five activity patterns are expected to decrease with an increase in government policy the residential pattern on the other hand is expected to increase as government restrictions increase so this was not inverted after flipping five of the activity patterns cosine similarity and pearsons correlation were calculated between each of the six categories and the stringency index for each country averaging across all countries the cosine similarities are shown in table 1  the results of this analysis identify differences in the relationship of each activity pattern to the stringency index rq2 three categories transit stations residential and retail  recreation all report relatively high similarity and low standard deviations suggesting that these similarities are relatively consistent across all countries the workplace activity category clearly aligns with the stringency index though not to the same degree as the previously mentioned three some potential reasons for this are explored in section 6 as expected parks are least similar to the stringency index and with a high standard deviation which indicates there is considerable variation in this mobility pattern across countries the grocery  pharmacy category is not as close to the stringency index with a larger standard deviation across countries than one might expect again some potential reasons for this are discussed in section 6 notably the ranked order similarity for activity categories based on averaged pearson correlation is the same as that of cosine similarity the previous section focused on the six categories and averaged across countries here we average across activity patterns and compare individual country responses we calculated the mean of the cosine similarity between each activity pattern and the stringency index for all activity categories excluding parks due to the volatility and weather dependency of this category this resulted in a single similarity value for each country we also calculated the average pearsons correlation coefficient value in a similar manner provided a cosine similarity and pearsons correlation for each country we computed kendalls  to measure concordance between the two measures this produced a  correlation coefficient of 0602 p  001 indicating a high level of concordance between these two approaches countries were then ranked based on their average activity pattern to stringency index similarity in essence this similarity value provides a relative indication of how a population responds to covid-19-related policy enacted by its government a high average similarity suggests that an increase in government policy leads to a decrease in overall place-based activity plots for three of the countries with the highest average similarity are shown in figure 2 with three of the least similar shown in figure 3  the full rank of countries is available in the project data directory at httpsplatialsciencecovid19code visually we see a high degree of similarity in the magnitude and absolute slope of the lines in these figures representing the actions taken by the government and the response from residents exploring the countries with the least similar patterns the country with the lowest value was south korea further investigation found that this is solely due to the time window of our analysis the peak of new cases in south korea occurred on february 29 2020 and local health officials started testing airport staff on january 21 2020 this is supported by the high stringency index value of 60 as it enters our analysis window on february 15th similarly japan taiwan mongolia and hong kong all show high stringency indices entering our analysis window suggesting that if a substantial decrease in residents place-based activity occurred it likely took place prior to february 15th and adjustments from the baseline the previous months as mentioned in the data section would be quite small the first country that entered our time analysis window with a relatively stable stringency index near zero was sweden followed closely by all other scandinavian countries this supports reporting by journalists and policy risk analysts that scandinavian governments specifically sweden are approaching the pandemic differently than most other countries 41 42  tanzania figure 3c  is the country with the lowest cosine similarity between citizen activity response and government stringency index outside of asia or europe the previous assessment method reported the similarity between the stringency index and the activity patterns overall without explicitly focusing on any one aspect of the curves in some instances however there is a delay effect between the policy enactment and the response we might see that the slope of the stringency index suddenly increases and three days later that change is mirrored by the activity patterns in addressing rq3 we must first test to determine if there is a quantifiable temporal lag between government action and population response if a lag response exists we can then identify which countries demonstrate the smallest or largest response lags the lag response analysis was done using a signal processing approach calculating the crosscorrelation as a measure of displacement similarity between each place-based activity pattern and the stringency index for each country the result is a vector containing the cross-correlation of the input vector based on lag for example if there is no significant lag between the stringency index and an activity pattern the highest cross-correlation would be found at lag zero and diminish as lag increases and decrease should a larger number of high cross-correlation values appear in negative lag positions this indicates that a significant change in the stringency index occurred before a significant change in the activity pattern given that our units are days the lag steps are also days rather than focus purely on the single lag value with the peak cross-correlation value we instead calculate the number of lag days with cross-correlation values above a significance alpha value of 05 and split them into lag days above and below zero we then subtract the number of remaining negative lag days from the number of positive lag days to produce our average lag for that activity pattern-stringency index pair this approach is intended to be more robust than looking for the single highest cross-correlation value as it considers skewness in the lag distribution this is a weighted approach to identifying the peak lag day as a function of all lags above the threshold avoiding an approach that ignores neighboring lag values in favor of a single peak similar to our previous analysis cross-correlation analysis was done between each activity pattern and the stringency index for each country and then averaged across all five activity patterns excluding parks producing an average signed lag response in days the countries were then ranked based on the lag response three countries with the largest lag-as reported by a significant change in the stringency index occurring well before or after the citizen activity response-are shown in figure 4  the vast majority of countries reported a negative lag response with a mean of -24 days in a select few instances the lag response was positive most of these could be explained by significant non-covid-19 related events for instance egypts positive lag is due to a severe weather event on march 12 2020 removing this event results in a lag of -40 the average lag time for each activity pattern was calculated across all countries and is shown in table 2  the high standard deviation for each of these categories speaks to the high degree of global variability in this assessment measure the grocery  pharmacy category reports the highest average lag time including the largest standard deviation as many grocery stores were labeled essential services in many countries and therefore not mandated to close people could choose to go to a grocery store immediately or a few days after to stock up on supplies in response to an increase in government covid-19 related restrictions  of the 108 countries with suitable place-based activity data for our analysis 46 of them also contain sub national regions eg provinces or states with their own activity patterns while the stringency index is only reported at the national level we thought it important to investigate the variation in place-based activity responses between subregions in the same country to accomplish this task we extracted all subregional activity data and again split them by category cosine similarity was computed for each subregion to each other subregion for each 10 category producing six matrices per country the standard deviation were taken for each category matrix in each country finally we calculated the mean standard deviation across all categories in a country to produce a single within country variation value on which to compare nations the purpose of this analysis was to determine the degree to which countries vary in their response to government action within their own borders the results speak to the power afforded national governments during crises a low standard deviation indicates that communities within the same country responded similarly a high standard deviation implies that communities in different subnational regions responded differently possibly heeding advice from local governments instead of at the national level the results of this subregional similarity analysis were compared to the results of our first cosine similarity assessment approach namely the stringency index to country level activity average similarities using kendalls  method the resulting concordance coefficient was 041 p  001 indicating that there is reasonably high positive correlation between the two results rq4 this indicates that countries whose residents respond to national government policy actions by reducing activities are also more likely to respond consistently across subnational regions to this point two countries that exemplify this difference are the united states and new zealand the united states ranked as having one of the highest sub-national region standard deviations which is to be expected given the authority placed on state governors during the covid-19 pandemic and the hands-off approach of the federal government 43  the similarity of the united states country-level activity response to the stringency index was in the lower 30th percentile of all countries in our dataset in contrast new zealand ranked quite high in both measures reflecting the perceived authority of the national government and commonality of the response from residents across subregions within the country overall the countries with the highest variation in subregional response were nigeria uruguay australia usa and canada the countries with the least variation were clustered predominantly in europe with france italy and spain topping the list next we investigate how our three measures cosine similarity lag response subregional variation align with the spatial relationships of the countries themselves first we take a high level approach by calculating the euclidean distance between each pair of country response vectors each vector is comprised of the six activity categories in each country three response similarity distances are computed for each pair of country vectors we then calculate the shortest geographic distance between each pair of countries in our dataset 9 using the rank correlation approach we computed the degree to which the geometric distance correlates with each of the response similarity distances given the non-normal spatial distribution and size of countries it is not surprising that the results while significant reported very low positive kendalls  values for all three measures cosine similarity lag time subregion variability we then explore countries based on the continent to which they belong the average similarity distance values for each of our three measures are reported in table 3  these values are split by continent and also reported overall within the same continent and between countries from different continents in general there is a slight difference between the average similarity distance between countries within the same continent and those between continents the difference however is less than one might expect implying as reported by the previous correlation values 9 using the postgis st distancesphere function that the spatial distribution explains little of the variability in country responses there are however substantial differences between continents for instance the cosine similarity distance of countries within south america is quite low indicating a high degree of similarity between countries within this continent at least as reported by their response to government policy actions the number increases for lag response suggesting that though they responded similarly there was greater variety in the lag response time than in europe for example this pattern is repeated for africa the reverse however is true for oceania though it must be noted that data for only three countries were used in this analysis and papua new guinea had a significantly different cosine similarity response than australia and new zealand these numbers should be interpreted relative to one another within the same measure not as absolute values or compared across measures taking a multidimensional scaling approach we compress the cosine similarity and lag response distances again based on vector similarity into two dimensions in order to visually represent the similarities and differences between the countries in a 2d plot figure 5 shows the results of this approach with countries assigned colors based on continent this figure nicely visualizes a few important findings the first is that there is a large cluster of countries that are all quite similar in their place-based activity response to covid-19 policy changes it is difficult to single out any one specific country but we do see a mix of countries from different continents second we can identify a number of countries that exist outside of the main cluster and many of these countries are from the same continent and in some cases the same subregion within the continent namely scandinavia last we can observe the outliers our previous analysis indicated that south korea and japan responded very differently from many other countries likely due to the fact that their governments responded before the temporal analysis window of our activity dataset we also see that south africa and egypt presented very different responses both of which have been mentioned in previous sections while multidimensional scaling is a good visualization tool for displaying similarity between entities such as these we acknowledge that it is a dimension reduction technique and so does not fully represent the nuances within the data increasing the spatial resolution of our analysis we assess the similarities in mobility responses between countries that share a border with those that do not for our cosine similarity measure those countries that shared a border reported a mean similarity distance of 0378 those that do not share a border reported a mean distance of 0589 a similar difference in mean distance was found for the lag response and the subregion variation measures in pulling apart these distance values for each country pair we found this to be the case in most countries but with a few notable exceptions for instance through this approach germany is shown to be quite dissimilar from its neighbors based on cosine similarity which mirrors what has been reported in the media 44 45  the united states and mexico were also quite dissimilar in their responses considerably different than the united states and canada the most similar countries that shared a border according to our cosine similarity measure are on the continent of south america namely columbia and venezuela ecuador and peru the largest lag difference in neighboring countries was also identified in south america in columbia and panama as well as central american honduras and el salvador the neighboring countries that were most similar with respect to lag response time are india and bangladesh with hungary and romania also being quite close with respect to the subregion variation analysis the most similar neighboring countries were italy and france also highly similar for cosine similarity followed by the czechia and slovakia the largest variance was also found in europe between italy and slovenia as well as switzerland and france figure 6 presents a visual representation of these similarities and differences through a dendrogram based on subregional variability again this is a subset of all countries where google published subregional activity patterns one of the interesting things that this visualization shows is the degree to which kenya and nigeria bottom two countries are dissimilar from all other countries this hierarchical clustering approach suggests that should all the countries be clustered into two groups based on their subregional variation that kenya and nigeria would make up one cluster while all other countries would be in the second cluster  the analysis thus far has focused on the relationships between government policy action as proxied by the stringency index and the place-based activity response as proxied by googles location services-based community mobility patterns in this section we explore the relationships between the findings of our analyses country-specific attributes and third-party global indices rq5 one possible reason for the differences we see between countries could simply be attributed to basic information about the country such as size and population to further investigate this we compute kendalls  and find no significant rank correlation between our mean cosine similarities 14 and population area or population density similarly there is no significant rank correlation between response lag and these three variables turning to the variation within country results we do find a significant negative correlation between population and subregional variation -0243 p005 indicating that as the population of a country increases the variability of activity between regions decreases no significant correlation was found with area or population density turning our attention to the immediate discussion of covid-19 we investigated the relationship between our computed similarity values the number of confirmed covid-19 cases per capita and number of deaths due to covid-19 per capita by country these values were taken on the last date of our time window april 11 2020 there was a positive correlation for each of these variables with our cosine similarity measure 0181 p001 and 0160 p005 respectively similarly there was a negative correlation with response time lag -0177 p001 and -0145 p005 respectively finally variation between subregions shows no significant concordance with number of confirmed cases but slight negative correlation 0165 p01 with number of deaths on this one might reasonably ask whether the changes in peoples place-based activity were due to increases in confirmed cases or deaths rather than government policy responses to the disease to address this we return to the stringency index and compare this index to the number of confirmed cases and deaths over time by country given the difference in magnitude stringency index is out of 100 while number of cases and deaths are limited only by the population of a country we chose to measure the rank correlation of the variables rather than the cosine similarity as was reported in 35  there is a strong positive correlation between cases deaths and the stringency index for our purpose however we find that the rank correlation between the average activity pattern and either confirmed cases 0610 or deaths 0569 by country is lower on average than the correlation between activity patterns and the stringency index 0631 this slightly larger  value suggests that a change in place-based activity patterns is more likely a response to government intervention than to reported numbers of cases or deaths though the three are obviously highly correlated next we compared the results of our three different similarity measures with the united nations human development index hdi this index consists of a large and broad range of indicators but we restricted our analysis to the top five as identified by the un namely hdi rank life expectancy at birth expected years of schooling mean years of schooling and gross national income per capita we found no significant correlations between the cosine similarity and any of the top hdi indicators including overall rank there was however positive correlation 0156 p  005 between the hdi rank and our response lag measure suggesting that countries with a lower hdi rank demonstrated a greater lag response time to government policy action three of the hdi indicators also correlated significantly with lag response time namely life expectancy at birth -0191 p 001 expected years of schooling -0145 p005 and gross national income per capita -0126 p01 comparing hdi to our standard deviation of similarity between subregions we discovered no significant correlation with overall hdi rank or any contributing indicators we next looked at a series of world development indicators wdi from the world bank of the 284 indicators that were reported by the world bank only five of them resulted in significant p01 correlation with our cosine similarity approach they are financing through local equity market quality of land administration pupil to teacher ratio in primary education diversity of workforce hiring and firing practices all  values were quite low with the first three indicators showing positive correlation and the last two being negative by comparison 97 of the wdi significantly p01 correlated with our computed response lag with 25 of them reporting high rank correlation significance p001 of these the most interesting and highest correlation coefficients were found in life expectancy and infant mortality deaths findings that reflect those of our comparison with the united nations hdi indicators additionally cases of tuberculosis and hivaids also positively correlated with lag time indicating that an increase in lag response occurred in countries with high numbers of these diseases comparing wdi to our standard deviation of similarity between subregions 53 of the wdi significantly p01 correlated with our measure with 10 of them reporting high rank correlation significance p001 the highest positive rank correlations were computed for gross domestic product gdp and foreign and domestic market size indicating that the larger the variance in activity responses within a country the larger the gdp and market sizes of the country finally we looked at three different indices broadly related to the topic of transparency the first of these indices the corruption perception index did not significantly correlate with any of our three computed measures similarly there were no significant relationships between the world press freedom index published by reporters without borders lastly we revisit one of the indices published by the world bank namely public trust in politicians as was reported by omission in the world bank section this indicator did not significantly correlate with any of our three measures these findings broadly suggest that overall trust in government and transparency did not play a substantive role in peoples reaction to government policy the purpose of the research presented in this paper is to identify the similarities and differences in how the inhabitants of different countries responded to government policies enacted during the spread of the covid-19 pandemic in this section we discuss the findings as well as the limitations in our approach and future work we also describe an online tool for researchers and the public to further explore these data themselves in addressing our first research question rq1 we investigated the relationship between the policy actions taken by national governments and the place-based activity response from people living the countries through our analysis we found that there is indeed a quantifiable correlation between the two using two different measures we demonstrated that an increase in the covid-19-related policies introduced by governments lead to a decrease in the mobility and activity of their population we further demonstrated that the correlation between these two are greater than the correlations with the underlying causes of the policies namely confirmed covid-19 cases and deaths investigating the countries themselves we found there to be significant variability in responses from country to country suggesting that some countries have a greater ability to actually enact envisioned policies than others in comparing the six different place-type activity categories eg grocery  pharmacy we discovered that some types of activities were more responsive to policy changes than others rq2 transit and residential-based activities were most responsive while grocery  pharmacy and parks showed the highest degree of variability between countries these results were supported by the findings from rq3 namely that there is a measurable lag between policy action and activity response on average the lag response equated to approximately 24 days across countries and activity categories but again the grocery  pharmacy category demonstrated the highest degree of variability between countries that this activity category would be the most volatile is reasonable in that groceries and pharmacies provide essential food and medication while many of the activities related to the other categories could be lawfully enforced through closures establishments offering access to essential supplies remained open thus permitting visits and reflected through increased activity the workplace category while not as volatile as the grocery  pharmacy category also varied a bit between countries in some countries we noticed weekly patterns in the data indicating that people were still going to work in some countries even while the transit category remained low and residential was high this requires further investigation but points towards the variability between country responses equity issues and enforcement of policies we also identified considerable differences in lag time from country to country some countries such as new zealand reported virtually no lag between government policy and community response whereas others eg south africa demonstrated a substantial lag mean 85 days of our three similarity measures lag response time demonstrated the highest correlation with global indices including development indicators such as life expectancy gdp and market size further to our goal of understanding the relationship between government policy and activity response we investigated the variability of responses between subregions within countries using a subset of countries for which google reports subnational activity patterns we calculated the variability of responses for each subregion to the national government policies we answered rq4 by showing that there are quantifiable differences in the variability of activity responses within a country the ranking of these countries correlated with country-level cosine similarity and lag response values suggesting that countries whos residents responded quickly and with a similar degree of magnitude to the policy actions were also more likely to respond similarly across subregions in addressing our final research question rq5 we compared our list of countries ordered by our three assessment measures to a range of global indices developed and curated by leading multi-national organizations a countrys gross domestic product life expectancy and infant mortality deaths showed the highest correlations and suggest that there is a link between peoples activity responses and a countrys level of development surprisingly none of the transparency indices correlated with our assessment measures indicating that public trust or perceived corruption in government had little impact on whether or not residents of a country followed their governments advice this work is not without limitations the most notable limitation is the lack of transparency in how the google community mobility dataset was created while this is a fantastic resource for researchers very little is known about the data collection methodology sample sizes geolocation accuracy etc as researchers we are working under the assumption that the data released publicly is valid and is a representative sample of mobile device users around the world this is a large assumption but one we must live with given the limited availability of covid-19 related activity data additional contextual factors may have played a role in assessing the similarity of activity responses as well we know weather for instance affects mobility and place-based activity as the covid-19 pandemic spread northern hemisphere countries were just beginning to enter spring which itself causes a change in activity behavior parks are likely the category most impacted by this but other activity categories may have been impacted similarly the par-tisan politics surrounding government policies and activity responses were largely ignored in this analysis a wide range of political hierarchies exist with many governments wielding most of the control at the national level and others delegating health-related policy to local districts and municipalities indices that report on the political underpinnings of a country would be useful to include in future work as we are currently in the midst of this pandemic there are a lot of unknowns and it is not yet clear what the outcomes of covid-19-related government policies nor activity reductions will be future work on this topic will extend to analyzing peoples response to relaxation of restrictive government policies and re-opening of economies it would be interesting to determine if residents respond to policy relaxation in similar ways additional datasets are being made available everyday and many of these datasets could be used in future analysis while we compared activity response to three different measures namely stringency index confirmed cases and deaths more government-related response indices would be worth investigation should they become available during our analyses we developed a visual analytics platform for quickly comparing country responses across the range of activity categories figure 7  we decided to share this platform publicly with the goal of allowing the public and researchers to explore these data and relationships the platform ingests all place-based activity data as reported by google at the country level and subnational level when available users are encouraged to toggle between the different categories and regions to compare activity responses the platform was built using javascript and the d3 framework 10 and is freely available to explore at httpsplatialscience covid19 the covid-19 pandemic will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the global economy and society at large while we are racing to coming to terms with the global impact of this crisis it is important to investigate the early patterns emerging from the spread of this pandemic in order to help us plan for future crises or a potential second wave of this current disease our focus in this paper was on gaining a better understanding of the relationship between the actions taken by national governments with respect to covid-19-related policy and the response of their inhabitants specifically as it relates to their activities we showed considerable differences exist between countries three approaches were used to quantify the relationship between policy and response though countries varied between measure commonalities emerged a number of the similarities and differences between countries can be explained through correlations with global indices such as market size or life expectancy not surprisingly countries that share a border were also more similar in their activity responses as this pandemic continues to spread and we look towards an uncertain future understanding how people respond to their government is an important step in combating this crisis  immigration policy and justice in the era of covid-19 holly miller ventura melissa ripepi amy ernstes m anthony peguero a   the novel coronavirus covid-19 was first detected in wuhan china in late 2019 and within months had upended much of the normative activities of daily economic social and governmental life the criminal justice system was not spared as virtually all aspects of the american legal system were faced with increased logistical and public health concerns overnight the strain on criminal justice was felt perhaps nowhere as acutely as in new york city the epicenter of the outbreak where the nypd to date may 25 2020 has lost 43 officers with another 5793 testing positive for covid-19 police and correctional officers have become front-line workers during the pandemic with heightened exposure to high-risk situations and locations often lacking the requisite personal protective equipment ppe necessary to reduce potential exposure contact with the public combined with the health dangers posed by correctional and detention facilities generally have placed these workers squarely in the midst of a system-wide crisis in a may 2020 survey of 32 state health departments the cdc reports that at least 4893 inmates and 2778 staff have been diagnosed with covid-19 while 88 and 15 respectively have been lost to the virus across 420 separate prisons and jails cdc 2020 the numbers are almost certainly higher the immigration system similarly has been impacted by covid-19 this is especially true given the criminalization of immigration processes more generally in recent years nowhere is this more so the case than in immigrant detention policies and practices immigrant detention a practice rarely utilized during most of the twentieth century has increased since the 1980s and reached its peak during the trump administration tens of thousands of immigrants are currently being held in detention facilities and local jails on any given day far exceeding the number of beds reported by the department of homeland security dhs these conditions are ripe for spread of communicable diseases and indeed early reports indicate that these detention facilities may be hidden covid-19 hotspots legal activity related to immigration policy and practice if anything has increased during the pandemic with lawsuits being filed by detainees staff and legal organizations on behalf of immigrants the aclu alone has filed 90 legal actions regarding covid-19 including state and city chapters that have filed lawsuits against us immigration and customs enforcement ice detention centers and processing centers in california maryland massachusetts michigan ohio pennsylvania texas and washington aclu 2020a 2020b as early as march 2020 a federal court in harrisburg pa ruled that ice must release 10 individuals who had sued on the basis of being at high risk of contracting coronavirus aclu-pa 2020 similar decisions were handed down in new jersey and massachusetts in april 2020 a federal judge in california ordered an ice detention facility to release detainees and facilitate social distancing kopetman 2020 a ruling followed by a federal judge in miami who ordered three ice facilities in south florida to release detainees due to the pandemic madan 2020a most recently another federal judge ordered the government to better explain why it had yet to release more than 350 parents and children from three family detention centers merchant 2020 on march 15 a coalition of immigration system functionaries including judges attorneys and ice officers sent a letter to the us department of justice requesting an emergency closure of the nations immigration courts brennan center 2020 subsequently a lawsuit was brought to suspend in-person immigration court processing during the outbreak a petition denied by a federal judge in washington dc kruzel 2020 the judge ruled that since the immigration system writ large had already modified its practices and protocols in light of covid-19 no sweeping stoppage of cases was warranted the coronavirus outbreak has also provided the trump administration with a pretext for alterations to existing immigration policies early on in the outbreak dhs moved to close the southern border immediately removing any migrants encountered by cbp by sending them back to mexico or central america within about two hours those from other nations are transferred to ice for rapid deportation including those potentially seeking asylum and children associated press 2020 this order was first issued in march and has since been renewed in april and may the latter of which notably had no end date on may 19 2020 the doj asked the 9th circuit court of appeals to replace the flores agreement which would allow the administration to modify the rules governing the detention of migrant children and families in dhs facilities though this too was predicated on stopping the spread of the coronavirus the administration announced as early as 2019 its desire to modify the court settlement flores was what also was used to justify family separation policies in 2018 stracqualursi et al 2019 due to the public health and economic threat posed by the virus the administration has also suspended immigration to the us for at least 60 days beginning in april to limit competition for jobs associated press 2020 the legal issues discussed above are myriad and dynamic impacting various aspects of the immigration system from lawful immigration to asylum seekers and refugees to unaccompanied children and detention center conditions while each of these deserve full empirical attention this paper focuses on three particular areas of immigration policy and practice during covid ice enforcement actions immigrant detention and deportations we summarize the current state of extant data and evidence on each of these and examine questions that remain for further research on march 18th 2020 ice announced that it would cease enforcement actions during covid-19 except for individuals who have committed crimes or pose a threat to public safety in an effort to decrease the spread of the virus and to encourage those who need medical attention to seek it specifically ice stated that during the covid-19 crisis ice will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities such as hospitals doctors offices accredited health clinics and emergent or urgent care facilities except in the most extraordinary of circumstancesindividuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement ice 2020 ice also temporarily suspended in-person reporting requirements as well as home visitations despite this announcement ice conducted immigration raids in states such as california even after the governor had declared a state of emergency and issued a stay at home order los angeles times 2020 though it did make fewer arrests in april compared to march ice still conducted operations leading to the arrest of at least 80 people in the los angeles area alone perrett 2020 other ice enforcement actions since the start of the coronavirus pandemic have taken place as well including an arrest of an 18-year-old on his birthday residing in an office of refugee resettlement shelter in westchester ny sidahmed 2020 this individual was then transferred to immigrant detention at a nearby county correctional facility at the height of new yorks coronavirus surge residents in san diego and riverside counties in southern california report increased border patrol checkpoints along i-15 a major throughway running north through the state from the mexican border as well as checkpoints along state roads increased use of roving patrols and at least four arrests since march 23 have also been reported to the media srikrishnan 2020 in the weeks prior to the march 18th announcement reports surfaced that immigrants were being targeted at hospitals courthouses and their childrens school burness and hindi 2020 lanard 2020 the miami herald reported that new arrests continued throughout the end of march including for those with non-criminal offenses madan 2020b these arrests were particularly notable as these individuals were then detained in several south florida detention facilities which have since become plagued with coronavirus these facilities have also been the target of legal action and ordered by the federal courts to release detainees due to unsafe conditions madan 2020a though ice pledged to limit enforcement actions during the pandemic the current situation in its detention facilities are significantly impacted by the administrations immigration crackdown in early 2020 when new york for example saw initial court appearances double in february and march compared to the december and january in the weeks prior to the march 18th announcement ice ramped up enforcement actions including a march 6 raid in new rochelle ny just hours before the area being designated a containment zone by governor andrew cuomo devereaux 2020 major ice operations were also carried out in michigan and ohio in early february well after coronavirus had gotten a foothold in the us warikoo 2020 prior to covid 19 a growing body of evidence was accumulating that immigrants are exposed to dangerously poor health conditions and services within ice detention centers immigrant adults and children in detention centers experience detrimental physical and mental health outcomes as do family units and households outside the immigration detention centers long 2018 ornelas et al 2020 for example detained immigrants have increased levels of musculoskeletal gastrointestinal respiratory and neurologic symptoms while being detained and also commonly experienced anxiety depression posttraumatic stress disorder difficulty with relationships and self-harming behavior immigration detention itself undermines family authority and ability to respond to their childrens needs this difficulty is complicated by parental mental health problems in more extreme cases immigrants mortality and death have been associated with being detained long 2018 ornelas et al 2020 a 2018 report titled code red the fatal consequences of dangerously substandard medical care in immigration detention reviewed fifteen deaths that occurred in ice detention between december 2015 and april 2017 long 2018 with the help of medical experts the report concludes that in more than half of those cases substandard medical care including unreasonable delays botched emergency responses and poor practitioner care contributed to the deaths many have argued that because immigration detention centers are private the lack of transparent policy health procedures and practices contribute to poor health conditions and services common in these detention centers ackerman and furman 2013 hernndez et al 2018 others suggest that poor health conditions and services are common in immigration detention centers because of the social political and cultural construction as undocumented or illegal immigrants are inherently criminal who do not warrant public healthcare attention and care ackerman and furman 2013 miller and peguero 2018 zarrugh 2020 this leads us to our question for this section are immigration dentition centers a shrouded hotspot for covid-19 although the situation changes on a daily basis ongoing reports indicate that this system of inadequate medical access care and resulting poor health conditions and outcomes has only been exacerbated by covid-19 because the demand for medical needs are greater for everyone generally the gap between need and supply has only become more apparent in detention centers it is especially dire for people in such facilities given that exposure to the virus can lead to relatively quick and life-threatening consequences like many facilities tasked with providing medical care these detention facilities must now concern themselves with need for covid tests personal protective equipment like gloves and masks and increased access to medical treatments such as oxygen and ventilators due to the highly contagious nature of covid-19 the crowded conditions of detention centers exacerbates the situation placing those held in these facilities at greater risk for contracting and spreading the virus this is true for those who are detained as well as employees at these facilities as of this articles writing ices website reports that as of may 11 2020 there are 29675 people being detained with 869 confirmed covid-19 cases with 1686 having been tested the website states that 42 ice employees working at detention centers have confirmed cases numbers are updated on ices website under the tab confirmed cases httpswwwicegovcoronavirus the heightened risk at detention centers can be evaluated in more concrete terms against cdc guidelines in short detention centers cannot meet those basic general guidelines social distancing of an ideal six feet is impossible to implement within detention centers given the spatial and physical limitations this inability also means that if someone at a detention center an employee or a detainee contracts the virus the likelihood of spread is increased along with the potential speed and magnitude of spread the danger of the situation is intensified in that many people may be asymptomatic carriers and spread the virus without knowing johns hopkins university 2020 in cramped quarters by the time symptoms start to show many may have already been infected additionally people who are detained have limited ability to use disease prevention measures like hand-washing both due to access and supplies it is harder to practice medical isolation which the cdc defines as confining a confirmed or suspected covid-19 case ideally to a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission ncird 2020 and it is more difficult to institute a quarantine which the cdc defines as the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a covid-19 case to determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease ncird 2020 acknowledging that facilities like jails prisons and detention centers possess significant impediments to these recommendations the cdc has produced the article interim guidance on management of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in correctional and detention facilities ncird 2020 in it guidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into three sections 1 operational preparedness which aims to prepare a facility for the situation of transmission of covid-19 into the facility 2 prevention which concerns preventing the spread from outside to inside of the facility and 3 management of covid-19 which describes how to manage confirmed and suspected cases yet still numerous reports internal strikes and resulting lawsuits indicate that many facilities fail to meet these guidelines per the lancet ice facilities do not have the staffing capacity or facilities to screen quarantine to monitor for symptoms isolate infected individuals or deliver medical management in a setting with high rate of infection meyer et al 2020 other reports have found a lack of needed supplies and ppe such as cleaning supplies masks gloves trevizo 2020 and some have noted that detainees are not being given ppe nor are they being tested even when they are sick and showing symptoms of covid-19 lippa 2020 detainees have reported that access to soap hand sanitizer and disinfecting equipment is very limited or non-existent montoya-galvez 2020d as a result of these conditions detainees at facilities across the country have organized related strikes and protests some examples include hunger strikes that have been organized across california including a 200 person strike at otay mesa detention center in san diego where at the time 120 detainees had confirmed cases plevin 2020 and a strike at adelanto ice processing center prompted by staffs failure to provide detainees ppe including masks gloves and cleaning supplies castillo 2020 protests have also been organized in detention centers in louisiana montoya-galvez 2020d and at least five hunger strikes have taken place at an ice processing center in pearsall texas alone  some because detainees are asking for information as detainees have reported being given false information about numbers and not being told about who has the virus and some for greater testing after positive cases trevizo 2020 since the spatial parameters of detention centers precludes the cdc guidelines of medical isolation and quarantining many are instead using a practice of cohorting which refers to isolating cases in groups and quarantining groups of people together who have possibly been exposed while the cdc outlines this practice in its guidelines for detention centers it is intended as a last resort one federal lawsuit has already been filed which alleges immigration officials are violating cdc guidelines by using cohorting instead of releasing immigrant detainees where possible joffe-block and fernndez 2020a since immigration detention is a civil and not criminal matter ice has the broad authority to release its detainees including by placing them in programs in which officials monitor them through ankle bracelets or check-ins montoya-galvez 2020f and many similar lawsuits have been filed pushing for releases as of may 15 2020 the aclu website states that it has filed 90 legal actions regarding covid-19 wwwacluorg these include state and city chapters that have filed lawsuits against ice detention centers and processing centers in california maryland massachusetts michigan ohio pennsylvania texas and washington american civil liberties union 2020a american civil liberties union 2020b aclu massachusetts 2020 aclu pennsylvania 2020 carmody 2020 coleman 2020 hancock 2020 morrissey 2020 an ongoing list of other organizations also filing lawsuits includes the university of miami school of laws immigration clinic the southern poverty law center rapid defense network legal aid service of broward county and the law firm of prada urizar pllc splc 2020 many of these lawsuits are seeking the release of detainees some with focus on high risk groups other groups like the new york lawyers for public interest nylpi have published reports documenting the poor conditions of detention centers and the increased urgency of these conditions in this era of covid-19 the nylpi report still detained and denied found serious often life-threatening deficiencies in the medical care provided to new yorkers in area immigration detention centers nylpi 2020 federal judges in some states have allowed for the release of small numbers of detainees who are at high risk for contracting the virus but many advocacy groups and lawmakers say it is not enough to address the dangerous conditions in which detainees are being forced to exist montoya-galvez 2020c at the end april a group of 26 senators signed a letter calling on the department of homeland security to investigate ice detention facilities to assess whether they have adopted necessary guidelines in regard to covid-19 us sentator d feinstein 2020 reports suggest a lack of transparency when it comes to number of confirmed cases some inaccuracy comes from the testing rate only about 5 of the population of people detained have been tested trevizo 2020 some reports note ices initial unwillingness to share numbers about cases and that it took lawsuits to prompt ice to share this information splc 2020 other reports highlight instances in which ice has released information that is later contradicted thus leading to questions about the accuracy of information provided joffe-block and fernndez 2020b lack of transparency is a similar issue for employee cases while ice reports numbers of confirmed cases among its employees at detention centers this does not include the many other employees at these facilities who are not directly employed by ice those who work for the county or private health care companies etc gomez et al 2020 detainees are also facing greater impediments to having their concerns heard and their experiences during the pandemic shared some detention centers are requiring lawyers to bring their own ppe to meet detainees gomez et al 2020 and many facilities do not have teleconferencing that allows for confidentiality due to unsecure connections or having to have conversations in earshot of employees gomez et al 2020 reports have also been surfacing about liability waivers detainees being required to sign liability waivers in exchange for ppe democracy now 2020 proctor 2020 rivlin-nadler 2020 and detainees being coerced into signing a paperwork that provides a positive evaluation of conditions in the detention center acevedo 2020 ice has also been minimizing and in cases outright denying some of the aforementioned strikes and protests in detention centers despite reports and evidence otherwise brown 2020 castillo 2020 beginning in the 1980s immigration law reforms merged practices from criminal law and justice with immigration law and enforcement the cumulative effect of which was to create a murky area in which immigration policing practices and court processes are not regulated by the constitutional protections afforded to individuals within the criminal justice system garca hernndez 2013 namely the 4th search and seizure 5th due process and 6th right to counsel amendments individuals within 100 miles of us international borders may be subjected to warrantless searches chacn 2010 noncitizens can legally be deported without judicial review menjvar et al 2018 though immigrants appearing in immigration court technically have a right to counsel the immigration courts are in no way obligated to provide them with counsel if they do not provide their own most are unable eagly and shafer 2015 this trend towards the tightening of immigration allowances while limiting protections increased under the obama administration as was evidenced through an upsurge in detention and deportation miller and peguero 2018 ricciardelli et al 2019 yet under the trump administration the rate of detentions and deportations has escalated to unprecedented levels policies enacted in the past three years that have contributed to this increase include promotion of a us southern border wall implementation of zero-tolerance which ordered the separation of children from their families and their subsequent detainment without a clear means to facilitate reunion deployment of 5000 us soldiers to the southern border and sanctioned use of teargas on children and families trying to cross and industrial tent facilities that housed over 3000 separated children adolescents without due process hernndez et al 2018 van hook and glick 2020 zarrugh 2020 it is important to note these policies and lack of protections for context as we move into our final considerations first how immigration policies both prior to covid-19 and under its guise are accelerating the us towards a near total dismantling of protections for immigrant men women children and families second through implementation of these policies is the us government spreading and deporting covid-19 since march 21 2020 the southern border of the united states has been in effect sealed the day before the centers for disease control and prevention cdc had issued a largely unnoticed but sweeping order authorizing the summary expulsion of noncitizens arriving at the border without valid documents guttentag 2020 by application of a medical quarantine authorization the order supersedes the protections of the immigration and refugee laws through the use of an unreviewable border patrol health expulsion mechanism unrelated to any finding of disease or contagion guttentag 2020 in the six weeks between the order and the beginning of may the us expelled over 20000 migrants montoya-galvez 2020a through either deportation to their country of citizenship or for cross-border migrants by processing and then returning them to mexico or canada montoya-galvez 2020b a process that takes on average 96 min hernndez and miroff 2020 access to us immigration courts is denied as is the opportunity to file a claim for humanitarian protection montoya-galvez 2020a individuals seeking refuge through asylum and unaccompanied children groups that are normally protected by both us and international law have been pointedly targeted in the enforcement of this measure between 2016 and 2018 the us government initiated two immigration policies that were designed to function as barriers specifically to migrants seeking asylum metering and the migrant protection protocols mpp according to the immigration and nationality act ina any alien who is physically present in the united states or who arrives in the united states whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the united states after having been interdicted in international or united states waters irrespective of such aliens status may apply for asylum immigration and nationality act 1952 the practice of metering contrary to the ina works by requiring all requests for asylum to cross the border at a port of entry and then limiting the number of people who are able to access asylum at each port of entry frederick 2019 american immigration council 2020a guards at these border crossings direct individuals who are barred from the process to a point-person on the mexican side of the border where his or her name is placed on a waiting list the backlog of which can require days or months of waiting in mexico with daily check-ins regarding an individuals list status lu and watkins 2019 under mpp or the remain in mexico program if access to make a claim of asylum is granted the individual is given notice to appear in immigration court and then as the program title suggests returned to mexico to await the court date american immigration council 2020a in 2019 over 60000 people were returned to mexico under mpp miroff 2020 as a result improvised camps have sprung up along the border in mexico outside of ports of entry camps that are lacking in basic sanitation reliable access to medical services food or water sources and security glass et al 2019 the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr has issued a statement that they are prepared to fold them under their protection and management as refugee camps van fossen 2020 and yet the us and mexico have both been unwilling to declare the situation on the border officially an emergency the mechanism required for the unhcr to take over van fossen 2020 unhcr refugee status would allow for three broad protections 1 basic needs in the form of shelter and security 2 the implementation of infrastructure necessary to support large-scale health initiatives and 3 access to a lawyer van fossen 2020 mexicos stated reasoning for denying the unhcr is they do not want permanent settlements glass et al 2019 the united states logic is less well-defined unless juxtaposed next to the goal of ending asylum along the southern border according to elora mukherjee professor of law and director of the immigrants rights clinic at columbia law school given the complexity of immigration law and language and cultural barriers the process of seeking asylum when someone is in the united states is hard enough requiring asylum seekers to remain in mexico makes navigating the process virtually impossible as it severely limits migrants access to legal counsel mukherjee 2020 only 4 of those who remain in mexico under mpp have been able to access a lawyer mukherjee 2020 in 2018 the year before mpp was enacted the us granted asylum to 13248 people miroff 2020 as of december of 2019 one year after mpp began 29309 cases had been processed and 187 people were granted asylum mukherjee 2020 until the public health order of march 20th 2020 one group that was exempt from the asylum processes discussed above was that of unaccompanied minors defined by us law to be a child who is under the age of 18 has no lawful immigration status and either does not have a parent or legal guardian in the united states or that parentlegal guardian is unable to care for them homeland security act of 2002 resulting from the us supreme court decision reno v flores the flores agreement set standards of legal protections for unaccompanied minors in the custody of us immigration agencies wu 2018 these standards were codified by the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization acts of 2000 tvpra reauthorized in 2003 2005 2008 and 2013 under tvpra unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries must be transferred from cbpice custody to health and human services hhs office of refugee resettlement orr within three days montoya-galvez 2020b orr is mandated to keep the minors in the least restrictive setting until they can be released to either family members or approved sponsors while they wait for their immigration court proceedings cheatham 2020 under tvpra dhs is mandated to the greatest extent practicable that unaccompanied children in hhs custody have counsel  not only to represent them in legal proceedings but to protect them from mistreatment exploitation and trafficking american immigration council 2020b in march of 2020 orr received 1852 from cbp custody in april that number fell to just 58 montoya-galvez 2020g understanding the scope of this issue is challenging due to the same transparency issues discussed previously in the section on detention under covid-19 the number of children specifically unaccompanied minors who have been expelled under cdc order is not reported by the dhs though multiple news sources have put that number for the month of april between 400 and 700 children montoya-galvez 2020a guttentag and bertozzi 2020 though immigration officials in guatemala have reported receiving 417 minors alone from us custody since march otoole and carcamo 2020a now under the covid-19 public health order the asylum system is in effect shut down for both accompanied minors and adults the mpp courts have been closed through june 19 2020 though that date could easily be pushed back us department of justice 2020 many of those awaiting asylum hearings are forced to continue to wait in the border camps discussed above without access to basic needs or medical services like the detention centers the camp conditions are primed for the proliferation and rampant spread of the virus the legality of such a closure has been questioned by immigrant rights groups and legal experts guttentag 2020 the one avenue to protection that remains open is through the convention against torture cat miroff 2020 a form of relief for which the barriers to attainment are higher than those of asylum but with fewer the protections granted american immigration council 2020a limitations of cat that are allowed through asylum status include the inability to apply for a green card to bring family members to the united states and ever leave us soil without losing their cat status american immigration council 2020a between march 21 and the beginning of may 2020 59 screening interviews were conducted by uscis 54 applicants were rejected and three cases were pending only two people had been granted cat protections miroff 2020 although it is under the auspices of a public health emergency that the united states has temporarily stopped processes for the issuing of green cards and asylum claims limited access to immigration courts prevented the placement of children with foster families and turned away hundreds of unaccompanied minors at the border ice air the transportation arm of immigration and customs enforcement ice responsible for arranging transportation and deportation of immigrants by air is part of the pre-coronavirus system that has continued to function with efficiency since march these deportations are pulling individuals from detention facilities where as discussed previously both physical structures and covid-19 cohorting policies provide a perfect storm for rapid spread of the disease and the scope of disease incidence is not well known due to limited testing thus far one out of every two people who have been tested had positive results though as of this writing that accounts for less than 57 of detainees ice 2020 since president trump declared covid-19 a national emergency on march 13 2020 united states government 2020 a good deal of evidence exists to suggest that the united states the epicenter for coronavirus is actively exporting the disease particularly to central america and the caribbean while statistics on the number of detainees who have been deported through ice air since the us declaration of a national emergency are not publicly available an analysis conducted by the center for economic policy and research determined that between march 15th and april 24th ice air made 71 flights collectively to guatemala honduras el salvador brazil nicaragua ecuador haiti and the dominican republic johnston 2020 as of april 17 2020 the ice screening process for detainees boarding ice air flights consisted of a temperature check in the flight line those with a fever above 99 degrees are removed for medical evaluation us immigration and customs enforcement 2020 according to an ice spokesperson they lack capacity to administer tests to all passengers on ice air flights prioritizing who gets tested depends on evolving operational considerations montoya-galvez 2020e deportees to haiti mexico jamaica guatemala and columbia have all tested positive for the virus upon arrival in their home countries mohammed et al 2020 twenty-percent of guatemalas covid-19 cases have been traced directly to the covid-positive status of returned detainees montoya-galvez 2020e haiti already on the edge of famine has only 62 ventilators for a population of over 11 million people sieff and miroff 2020 its capacity for quarantine exists within four hotels with 111 beds since april all 111 have been designated to migrants returned on ice deportation flights charles 2020 in recognition of this the governments of both guatemala and haiti have repeatedly asked the us to temporarily cease ice air flights charles and madan 2020 otoole and carcamo 2020b guatemala has gone so far as to stop deportations from the us three times first on march 17th by suspending all incoming flights in order to create the space and time for both their government and the us government to establish health protocols to help them address the covid-19 deportation crisis mcdonnell et al 2020 madan and charles 2020 as of late april the us began testing immigrants prior to deportation narea 2020 but as noted above the testing is in no way comprehensive the danger covid-19 poses to health systems in countries with already vulnerable public health infrastructure is both direct and potentially catastrophic it will overwhelm marginal economic systems further exacerbating living conditions that demand of many that they must migrate in order to survive the issues examined here confirm three realities for the us immigration system first despite a stated moratorium on ice enforcement ie police actions issued in march agents continue to conduct immigration raids set up checkpoints and make arrests while ice cautioned that it would continue to take action against undocumented immigrants that pose a public safety risk the criminal records of many of those targeted are hardly what one might expect to justify police raids during a pandemic eg drunk driving drug possession there are also reports of ice detaining other immigrants along with the original targets of the raids including family members or associates that are simply nearby these anecdotes coupled with a distrust of ice more generally has reportedly led to widespread fear that these continued enforcement actions may prevent the sick from seeking medical treatment if they are undocumented evidence to date also indicates that ice detention facilities are likely shrouded covid-19 hotspots insofar as detention facilities generally are unable to adhere to cdc guidelines and testing is limited and sporadic it is improbable that these locations can effectively detect and control the virus when it is present indeed a litany of legal actions have been undertaken to remedy some of the most obvious problems and facilities in the ice detention system though the agency generally has been slow to respond to these directives moreover there is evidence that instead of releasing detainees many are simply shuffled around to other facilities with more space available in some cases such as in south florida these receiving facilities have already experienced a covid outbreak finally data gathered to date indicate that deportations have continued during the pandemic and the asylum system has been in effect dismantled by the administrations response these deportations are concerning for at least two main reasons first that the us continues to violate its own and international law regarding asylum claims second that us policy is contributing to the spread of coronavirus throughout latin america and the caribbean as noted above deportees to haiti mexico jamaica guatemala and columbia have already tested positive for the virus upon arrival in their home countries mohammed et al 2020 and 23 of guatemalas coronavirus cases have been traced directly to the covid-positive status of returned detainees montoya-galvez 2020e as additional data are gathered there are sure to be further cases linked to the us immigration system though the production and acquisition of empirical data related to covid-19 and the immigration system are in its infancy this paper sought to highlight how covid-19 global pandemic has changed our current understanding of the relationships between immigration policy and justice in the us it is also important to note that we are only in the initial stages and logically the beginning of even understanding or hypothesizing how covid-19 will impact us immigration policy and justice as well as how other nations attempt to grapple with the complexities of immigration and justice during a pandemic the emerging reports arguments and conceptualizations of us immigration and justice discussed here only highlights the important advances to be made towards better understanding the correlates contexts and interactions of us immigration policy and justice during a global pandemic we encourage future research to further expand our evidence-based understanding of how covid-19 has impacted us immigration policies and practices particularly in regard to the pursuit of justice but more importantly it is vital to utilize evidence-based research to pursue just us immigration policies and practices in this covid-19 era  a review of the impact of covid19 corona virus on the oil sector   the scale of the demand decline due to the lockdowns and travel bans is so far difficult to quantify with estimates ranging from 16 mn bpd to over 25 mn bpd through q2 and dropping back to differing degrees after that fact global energy said it sees global oil demand down by 79 mn bpd in 2020 the iea expects global oil demand to collapse by 93 mn bpd over the year and said that 2020 would be worst year in history of global oil market it expects nonopec supply will fall permanently by at least 23 mn bpd by midapril rystad energy said global oil demand was on track to collapse by 94 mn bpd in 2020 or 94 due to the lockdown measureswhich it revised up to 103 mn bpd at the end of the month the worst month is expected to be april rystad said global fuel consumption is expected to drop almost 28 mn bpd in april to 726 mn bpd and 21 mn bpd in may as a result of covid19 lockdowns and restrictions on travel goldman sachs put the april number slightly lower at 26 mn bpd due to lockdowns affecting over 90 of global gdp fact put the april fall at 24 mn bpd year on year earlier in april platts said it expected oil demand to shrink by a record 16 mn bpd in april and may with yearonyear demand falling at least 45 mn bpd in 2020the lowest of the forecasters reviewed there are some signs of recovery already with china slowly ending its lockdown and parts of europe beginning to loosen restrictions in fact china has maintained strong demand for crude throughout the epidemic although much of this went to storage see below there were moderate falls in consumption and refinery throughput in february and march but that has now reversed this is not yet the case in the united states and europe where demand remains at end april sharply down alongside refinery throughput demand is projected to rebound sharply later this year and into 2021 although there are questions over whether it will ever return to the 100 mn bpd level with key consuming sectors such as aviation and other travel likely to see long term impact from covid19 longer term the cheap oil could offset any virusrelated decline by improving its competitive position relative to alternatives rystad said it saw jet fuel being hit the hardest this year with global demand falling 31 year on year or by at least 22 mn bpd total demand for road fuels will fall by 94 or by 45 mn bpd from estimated 2019 levels of 477 mn bpd in the united states total product demand fell for six consecutive weeks by a total of 37 from early march amid widespread state and local stayathome orders see figure 2 although there was a rise in the week to 17 april of 306 000 bpd putting consumption at just 1410 mn bpdthe lowest on record according to the eia the most recent value is 31 lower than the 2020 average from january through 13 march or before many of the travel restrictions began in europe the demand situation appears even worse the uks car use rate sank to about 20 or less in many places through april with the countrys biggest fuel retailer supermarket giant tesco reporting fuel sales down by 70 in france the demand drop is estimated between 70 and 90 for road fuels and 95 for jet fuel according to fge italy and spain have been particularly badly hit with demand slashed by up to 80 for gasoline indian demand for refined products fell 178 year on year in march to 407 mn bpd according to provisional data from the petroleum planning and analysis cell due to a lockdown lasting 6 weeks which was implemented 25 march so the effect in april is likely to be much more severe diesel was down 242 year on year in march and gasoline down 164 jet fuel demand slumped 324 year on year as flights were grounded lpg demand however increased as more turned to home cooking the middle east faces an economic downturn due to low oil prices as well as the impact of the virus so while it has yet to be as severe in this region the drop in consumption of oil products could last longer after being a driven of global demand growth for many years demand for oil products there is expected to drop by 29 this year with jet fuelkerosene consumption down 15 and gasoline 6 according to platts midapril china on the other hand has already begun to ramp up oil purchases due to the low prices imports rose 45 in march year on year to 968 mn bpd according to chinas general administration of customs data

 chinas january and february oil imports averaged 1047 mn bpd while its q1 imports averaged some 102 mn bpda 5 year on year rise this was despite a fall of 69 in gdp for the first quarter indicating a high level of stock builddriven by the eagerness of chinese buyers to snap up cheap cargoes further enhanced by the saudi osp discounts opecs 13 members along with their 10 partners in the larger opecplus group have agreed to reduce their supply by 97 mn bpd in may and june there will be the normal caution over compliance levels although given the weakness in demand it may be difficult even to sell the allocated volumes the cuts will then be eased to 77 mn bpd between july and december 2020 and then 58 mn bpd between january 2021 and april 2022 according to the agreement russia and saudi arabia will use 11 mn bpd as a baseline for the reductions which they will split evenlyunlike previous opecplus deals where saudi arabia has born the bulk of cuts and russia very little for other producers the baseline will be their output in october 2018 the basis for previous cuts which is seen as an advantage for the worlds two biggest exporters as the 11 mn bpd baseline is up on both saudi arabias october 2018 production of 1063 mn bpd and russias 1075 mn bpd the split of the cuts from the 11 mn bpd baseline includes 25 mn bpd for saudi arabia and russia which will bring their output down to 85 mn bpd each in may and june both countries will then ramp up output to 899 mn bpd for the second half of 2020 and then to 95 mn bpd for all of 2021 through to april 2022 it may be more difficult for russia to control output to this extent for technical and commercial reasons and a key challenge will be to ensure highercost mature fields do not end up closing permanently however currently endapril saudi output is running well above both target and baseline according to mees saudi arabia managed to reach its promised 12 mn bpd production figure a target following the breakdown of opecplus on 6 march in early april and is likely to average its highest ever of 123 mn bpd for the month as a wholeso the actual cut for may will have to be close to 4 mn bpd if the kingdom is to meet its deal commitment aramco confirmed on 17 april that this was its intent on the other hand production in russia iraq and venezuela had already been hit by the price collapse and competition from discounted saudi barrels by midaprilincluding falls of 300 000 bpd in iraq and 235 000 bpd in venezuela russia produced 1125 mn bpd liquids in march with 1060 mn bpd of this being crude and this is expected to be lower in aprilso the actual cut it will need to make in may will probably be 2 mn bpd another sharp cut amounting to almost 15 mn bpd has been pledged by the uae which also ramped up production heavily after the 6 march opecplus breakdown to a record 342 mn bpd in march reaching over 4 mn bpd at the beginning of april this will have to come down to below 25 mn bpd iraq also has a big cut of about 106 mn bpd around a quarter to make in may and june with kuwait and other opec members cutting a similar proportion nigeria has to cut from around 2 to 14 mn bpd under the deal but may go lower still as it struggles to sell its oil up to 50 mn bbl of unsold nigerian cargoes remained on the water in midaprilthis was not a deliberate cut by nigeria but a simple lack of demand for its crudepartly due to its high jet and gasoline yields and discounts among competing saudi grades as well as run cuts in europe and asia and high freight rates on what is a longhaul route to market so nigeria may have fulfilled its entire commitment under the deal without acting and before saudi arabia has even started reining in record export levels altogether increases in output from saudi arabia uae and kuwaiti saw opec output at a 3month high of 2897 mn bpd in march according to platts with compliance among the 10 opec countries with quotas collapsing to 13 from 120 in february this was despite sharp declines among the three members exempt from quotas iran libya and venezuela where production continues to fall particularly in libya due to civil war see looking ahead other countries not in opec that are cutting include kazakhstan and azerbaijan where governmentimposed cuts are being made to large projects operated by oil majors for the first time these include the azerichiragguneshli project which is led by bp alongside partners exxon mobil equinor inpex and mol azerbaijan will need to cut its production for 2 months starting in may by 75 to 80 000 bpd or about 15 of its output the april deal also includes norway canada united kingdom mexico and the united states although most of the commitments here are likely to come as a result of commercial decisions to shutin highcost crude due to low prices or for logistical reasons rather than governmentimposed cuts and the lower prices go the more will be shutin energy intelligence group believes up to 7 mn bpd could be shut in for commerciallogistical reasons by june citi estimates that such supply curtailments because of logistical bottlenecks and low prices could force 10 mn bpd offline temporarily in april goldman sachs put the figure at 5 mn bpd the greatest impact will be in the atlantic basin where low prices high stocks and the longest travel time to customers will likely lead to production curtailments in the united states canada brazil and west africa in mexicos case after initially not agreeing to formal opecplus cuts only offset when president trump offered to cut on mexicos behalf mexico said later in april that it would shut down new wells because of low prices now that oil has no value we can shut down the valves said mexicos president obrador

 argentina which has long forced producers to sell domestically at discounted prices plans to protect its producers including those in the vaca muerta shale patch with a rise in domestic crude prices to 45bbl the biggest falls outside opecplus are expected to come from the united states and canada where wti prices of 20bbl puts roughly 5 mn bpd of high cost crude production at risk of being shut in according to experts in the united states strong output growth reversed in march and will continue to fall sharply in april and for the rest of this year and into next by july it will be declining at a rate of over 200 000 bpd per month according to the eia and recent falls in wti prices may accelerate this the falls will come from output declines as fresh drilling stops and from actual well closures rig numbers in the us shale sector have already tumbled to 438 in the third week of april according to baker hughes

 down almost 50 on april 2019 indicating a sharp reduction in fresh drilling which given the rapid decline rates at us shale wells will see output falling quickly a halving of rig numbers is expected to see output down by about 700 000 bd by december 2020 and around 2 mn bpd by december 2021 the canadian rig count has also dropped reaching its lowest level since 2000 the volume of us well closures is so far unclear but the eia expects an overall decline of 2 mn bpd by the end of the year so that suggests the actual closure of about 13 mn bpd in output remaining to be cut after natural decline more than 10 of us crude production comes from extremely low production stripper wells which can come offline relatively quickly operator cash position hedging quality access to markets storage options and operating costs are between them likely to determine where the rest of the closures occur examples of companies cutting output include continental resources which plans to curtail 30 in april and may largely from its bakken production similarly parsley energy has begun shutting in about 400 of its less productive wells in the permian in canada a number of major closures have already been announced in the high cost tar sands in alberta while canadas western canada select oil a heavy acidic crude grade is under particular pressure as it trades at a discount to benchmarks and has few outlets tudor pickering holt estimates that as much as 20 or some 340 000 bpd of thermal oil sands production could be shut down due to the oil price slump and by midapril the country had already shutin about 325 000 bpd brazil and norway were also on the way to cutting their share by midapril with brazil down 200 000 bpd from mature fields onshore and in shallow waters according to petrobras the uk has also made a commitment to cut although reduced output due to staffing issues around the corona virus and upcoming maintenance may be enough most of the commercial and logistical shutins will come from independents and majors with some nonopecplus asian nocs pttep for example saying they will continue with existing output and spending plans unchanged majors are also exposed to quotalinked reductions among opecplus members with compulsory cuts being imposed at equity production including in iraq uae oman and azerbaijan longer term reductions of up to 30 in upstream capex announced by majors will have a significant impact on output from these big producers putting upward pressure on prices and expanding opec market share in future years the collapse in global demand and surge in april supply is rapidly filling up the worlds spare storage capacityencouraged by a steepening market contango where future oil prices are higher than prompt the ieas fatih birol said the filling of strategic stocks by countries would provide some relief to the oil market but would not be able to absorb all the supply surplus at least four countries namely china india south korea and the united states have either offered their storage capacity to industry to store their barrels or are increasing their strategic stocks to take advantage of lower prices said mr birol in midapril this will provide greater headroom for the surplus supply peak in the coming weeks estimating these efforts could take out 200 mn bbl assuming they happen in the next three months this could represent as much as 2 mn bpd of supply withdrawn from the market he said the us spr looks likely to be filled by private companies leasing storage rather than government purchases with congress not making public funds available by midapril at least nine us oil producers were talking with the government over storing 23 mn bbl in the spr according to the us doe most of the deliveries will be received at the four main spr storage sites on the gulf coast in may and june the spr would still have about 55 mn bls of capacity commercial us reserves are also on the rise as of 20 april they rose to 5036 mn bbl or about 6 above the 5year average for this time of year with further sharp rises to tanktop anticipated for both crude and products over coming months china and india are also filling their strategic reserves with cheap oil india only has about 12 to 13 mn bls of spare capacity out of a total spr of 39 mn bbl china has a great deal more with strategic reserves expected to reach 115 billion barrels this year as the second phase of its strategic reserve development is completed chinese inventory levels have been rising at 2 mn bpd since the beginning of the year floating storage is also a viable option by midapril estimates suggested over 200 mn bbl of oil was already held in floating storage including on 50 to 60 very large crude carriers vlccs and smaller tankers typically found in the us gulf of mexico and singapore

 in theory the global crude oil tanker fleet can carry up to 3 bn bbl but realistically only 300 to 500 mn bbl are available according to eig some vessels have been booked to store crude for up to 3 years potentially the longest ever duration for floating storage storage costs have surged supported by the steepening market contango this has put upward pressure on freight rates generally making it more expensive to move oil around the world which is adding to market access problems for crudes with long haul routes to market such as united states flows to asian refiners russias storage facilities are limited and are not designed for longterm storage russias state pipeline and storage operator transneft is thought to have 422 000 bpd of capacity both for crude and products including in the pipeline system transshipment points and storage according to platts russias four key export outlets on the baltic black sea and sea of okhotsk can store up to 55 000 bpd refiners are responding to lower demand with run cuts by 10 april global refinery runs were down by about 14 mn bpd according to platts with european outages at record highs and us refiners considering further cutsalthough some cuts in asia were already beginning to be reversed by endapril platts expects overall second quarter runs to be 10 mn bpd lower in 2020 than in 2019 in the united states alone run cuts peaked at 477 mn bpd of crude distillation capacity in midapril and are expected to hit 5 mn bpd by the end of the month and continue to decline beyond that bps us refineries were reported to be running at between 10 and 30 below normal in midapril asian refiners cut runs by 27 mn bpd in the first quarter of 2020 and are expected to cut throughput by at least 4 mn bpd in the second quarter although they are likely to recover by june chinas state oil companies began raising refinery utilization rates midapril due to recovering demand as industrial production and transportation resume sinopec raised its run rates to 72 in march from a historical low of 64 in february and will further increase throughput in april according to platts petrochinas refineries most of which are in northern china and inland have cut their average throughput plan from 78 in january to 66 in february to 64 in march refiners elsewhere in asia including japan are considering more cuts japan is already facing excess crude supply of about 16 mn bls in june as storage fills up and refinery runs are cut 14 to 20 500 000 bpd and over to balance reduced demand leading refiners to delay term crude deliveries indian refiners have also declared force majeure on some crude imports due to the lockdown there with stateindian oil corp cutting throughput at most of its refineries by 25 to 30 lockdowns in malaysia thailand and pakistan have also led to sharp run cuts there south korea has also cut but has seen less impact on demand although stocks are filling some of the cuts here will come from delayed commissioning and expanded maintenance for example sk energy has delayed commercial production from its new 40 000 bpd vacuum residue desulfurization unit gs caltex has brought forward regular maintenance european refining outages were around 2 mn bpd midmonth with as much as 50 of downtime about 600 000 bpd linked to tanktop storage despite strong margins as crude slumped the steep saudi crude osp discounts to asian refiners mean they are likely to be protected to some extent compared to other regions as well as ensuring saudi grades retain market share among asian refiners at the expense of competing grades saudi arabia has also left may 2020 osps to us refiners at relatively low levels resulting in at least 20 saudi vlccs heading to the gulf coast putting further pressure on us producers for europe and the mediterranean aprils osp cuts have been maintained continuing the discounts against russian urals pricing and making it difficult for russia to compete for sales however the eventual supply cuts pan out the industry is unlikely to ever be the same again and covid19 may have further as yet unforeseen implications for demandalthough there is the possibility that supply adjustment will enable a fresh balance in the market by later in the year and some price recovery from there on  insertion-deletion systems with substitutions i marcella anselmo gianluca della vedova florin manea arno pauly martin vu henning fernau   insertion-deletion systems or ins-del systems for short are well established as computational devices and as a research topic within formal languages throughout the past nearly 30 years starting off with the phd thesis of kari 3 however from its very beginning papers highlighting the potential use of such systems in modelling dna computing also discussed the replacement of single letters possibly within some context by other letters an operation called substitution in 2 4 interestingly all theoretical studies on grammatical mechanisms involving insertions and deletions omitted including the substitution operation in their studies with this paper we are stepping into this gap by studying ins-del systems with substitutions or ins-del-sub systems for short we put special emphasis on extending context-free ins-del systems with substitutions we observe quite diverse effects depending on whether the substitutions are context-free one-sided or two-sided we can characterize the context-sensitive languages by extending context-free insertion systems with substitutions which can be seen as a new normal form for monotone chomsky grammars for omitted proofs and further results see 13 for every ins-del system documentclass12ptminimal

mcs and b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma nhl 13 the mechanisms whereby hcv establishes hepatic or lymphoproliferative diseases are still poorly understood innate immune response relies on recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamp through pattern recognition receptors prrs that include the toll-like receptors tlrs tlr2 tlr3 tlr7 and tlr9 have a crucial role in host defense against hcv infection and hcv liver diseases 47 like other tlrs tlr1 tlr4 tlr5 tlr6 and tlr10 tlr2 is predominantly expressed on the cell surface to sense extracellular pamps in contrast tlr3 tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 are located in intracellular compartments and recognize viral nucleotides tlr2 has been associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and is known to be triggered by the core-protein of the hcv nucleocapsid 812 intriguingly specific tlr polymorphisms mainly the tlr2 196 to 174 insdel influence the extent of tlr2 expression and have been associated with more advanced liver diseases 13 14 tlrs signal through specific downstream molecules that finally activate transcription factors driving the expression of different cytokines including interferons 15 16 inappropriate production of interferons has been associated to various hcv-related processes that may be the prelude to malignant complications 17 18 interferon-lamba ifn is a family of four genes ifn1 il29 ifn2 il28a ifn3 il28b and ifn4 a frameshift variant of il28b 19 they target the il28r and il10rb receptors resulting in the activation of janus kinasesignal transducers and activators of transcription jakstat signaling with expression of interferon-stimulated genes isgs and induction of an antiviral state however unlike type i ifn receptor which was expressed on virtually all cell types il28r was only expressed on specific tissues such as epithelia 20 a single nucleotide polymorphism snp in the promoter region of the il28b gene the rs12979860 was originally associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of genotype 1 hcv infection 2 17 2126 we hypothesized that if tlr2 and il28b were functionally interconnected in hcv diseases-specific networks both tlr2 and il28b polymorphisms could have a critical role in the pathogenesis of hcv-related disorders to test this hypothesis we investigated tlr2 196 to 174 insdel and rs12979860 il28b polymorphisms in hcv-related liver and lymphoproliferative diseases in an italian population patient characteristics and group distribution were shown in table 1 gender and hcv genotypes were found differentially distributed among hcv-related disease groups male gender was preferentially found associated with liver diseases cir and hcc 67 to 71 while female gender was more frequent in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders mcs and nhl 63 and 61 hcv genotype 1 was the most frequent genotype found in our population 53 to 82 no association between hcv genotypes and hcv viral load was observed figure 1 shows the genotype frequencies of tlr2 insdel 196 to 174 polymorphism in patients with hcv hcv-related diseases and blood donors bd distribution of bd tlr2 insdel genotype frequencies in our case series was similar to that reported in the literature 13 carriers of wild-type tlr2 insins genotype represented 716  of all hcv-positive patients with a frequency of 70 to 77 in the different hcv-related diseases and 75 in bd figure 1 data indicated a slight association between tlr2-del allelic variant with hcv infection but the difference was not significant when polymorphism frequencies of all hcv-positive patients were compared to those of bd dominant tlr2 insins vs tlr2 insdel  tlr2 deldel or  120 table 2 however patients carrying tlr2 deldel genotype showed an increased risk for hcc compared with all other groups of patients and bds by using pair wise comparison test one-way analysis of variance hcc vs nhl p  0004 figure 2 in particular a positive trend between tlr2 deldel genotype and an increasing risk for hcc ie chc 43 cir 49 hcc 103 was found by contrast the tlr2 deldel prevalence in nhl patients 09 was similar to that found in bds 13 thus findings indicated that tlr2 deldel genotype condition correlate with primary liver cancer rather than hcv-positive malignant lymphoproliferation no additional significant differences was observed for tlr2 insdel genotype or allele frequencies the results of il28b genotyping in patients with hcv-related diseases and bds were shown in figure 1 distribution of rs12979860 genotype frequencies found in our series was similar to those reported in the literature 17 21 22 results of previous studies where il28b cc genotype enhanced the spontaneous resolution of hcv infection indirectly support a possible role for the il28b c allele in the control of hcv infection in keeping with these observations we found a negative trend for cc genotype frequencies balanced by an increased trend in tt genotype in hcv-positive patients compared with bds il28b cc dominant polymorphism vs il28b ct il28b tt or 046 p  0025 table 2 one-way test confirmed the significant positive trend for t allele in patients with chronic hcv-infection which was more evident in patients with liver damage instead of a lymphoproliferative disorder figure 2 thus the analysis indicated a t allele gradient able to discriminate a chronic status more prone to evolve into liver injury from a condition more likely developing a lymphoproliferative dysfunction p  0001 figure 2 the frequency of il28b t allele in chc cir hcc was 437 in mcs nhl was 351 in bds was 272 no linkage disequilibrium between tlr2 and il28b polymorphisms was found as the test for correlation resulted not significant 862 data pairs tested coefficient of correlation 003 the tlr2-il28b polymorphisms formed several haplotypes whose frequency was reported on table 3 the distribution analysis of haplotypes confirmed that specific haplotypes discriminated between hcv-positive patients more likely evolving towards liver damage and those instead evolving towards a lymphoproliferative disorder indeed a significant lack of the tlr2-insins il28b-cc haplotype was not only associated with a chronic hcv status p  0007 or 294 table 4 but closely correlated with a liver damage rather than a lymphoproliferative-disease progression p  ns or 105 p  0029 or 177 respectively table 4 hcv viral load was assessed in serum samples for 197 patients at diagnosis a higher hcv viral load was mainly associated with the presence of il28b cc rather than that of il28b tt genotype il28b additive 2 p  0005 hr 168 95 ci 102-275 table 5 and tlr2 insdel genotype than homozygous tlr2 additive 1 p  0026 hr 130 95ci 096-173 multivariate regression analysis indicated that il28b tt recessive genotype was independent of hcv genotype age patient gender and tlr2 variables and it was associated with a lower hcv viral load p  0044 exp 152 95 ci 101-227 given the potential role of host immunity in the control of hcv-infected tumor cells and the potential of age-related influences on tumor progression we also looked for a liver disease age-related trend and tlr2-il28b haplotype continuous age variable was analyzed between liver and lymphoproliferative groups with respect to the dominant wild-type tlr2- il28b haplotype and a significant association was found with bds and patients with a lymphoproliferative disease a significant difference was found in the mean age between patients having a dominant haplotype and a liver disease compared to those having a different haplotype cir patients 689 vs 620 mean age p  0038 hcc 724 vs 677 mean age p  002 figure 3 immunogenetic profile may play an important role in determining the progression of chronic hcv infections to different diseases 13 5 27 we confirmed the role of rs12979860 il28b-c allele-carrier as a protective factor for chc 2 17 2126 in addition we highlighted that the il28b cc genotype correlates with lymphoproliferative disease when associated with a tlr2-ins allele in homozygosity table 4 on the contrary homozygous tlr2-del allele tlr2-deldel exhibits a significantly higher threshold for hcc development figure 2 overall the present results were consistent with an interlocked role between tlr2 and il28b ifn-3 gene variants in directing hcv-related diseases progression indeed it has been shown that tlr2 was able to activate transcription factors that drive the expression of antiviral genes and different cytokines such as interferons 15 16 several studies have indicated a relation among rs12979860 il28b gene spontaneous clearance of hcv and therapeutic outcomes of genotype 1 hcv-positive patients treated with ifn-based therapies 2 2126 in 2013 a new interferon the ifn-4 was identified the rs368234815 polymorphism originating the ifn-4 by creation of a new open reading frame 19 28 was found in strong linkage disequilibrium with the rs12979860 il28b so much it has been described as the functional variant of the rs12979860 il28b 19 29 thus spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of hcv resulted equally dependent on rs12979860 or rs368234815 polymorphisms and combined assessment of these gene polymorphisms did not increase the predictive value of il28b polymorphisms in hcv-positive patients 19 29 more recently it was found that y93h a variant present in the ns5a region of hcv was significantly associated with the beneficial rs12979860 polymorphism confirming the functional role of ifn-4 snp in hcv-infection 30 the haplotype data presented herein table 4 provided evidence supporting a role for il28b in relation with tlr2 polymorphism to predict progression to different hcv-related diseases recent functional studies have demonstrated that il28b tt genotype was associated with a higher production of ifn-3 and higher isgs gene expression in hcv-infected liver tissue and that this higher baseline level of isgs expression may contribute to an interferon-refractory state in the liver 31 thus it has been hypothesized that the high baseline isg levels found in il28b tt carriers can lead to a poor response to inf-based therapy due to an exhaustion of the interferon-response pathway 32 in keeping with this model a satisfactory treatment response could be associated with a il28 cc genotype a lower levels of isgs expression and thus a higher levels of circulating hcv rna 33 our findings about higher viral load in patients having il28b cc genotype may support this hypothesis a higher viral load was associated with hcv genotype 1 but difference among genotypes did not reach a statistical significance in our series the observed broader frequency of il28-t allele in patients with hepatic rather than lymphoproliferative disorders can be explained by the fact that the il28-ril-10r receptor complex was expressed only in restricted cell types like hepatocytes epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells 34 considering that hcv was primarily hepatotropic it is reasonable to assume that il28b-t allele could likely contribute to an ifn-refractory state mostly in the liver in this regard it has been observed that the expression levels of isgs were differentially regulated in the liver and peripheral blood 35 36 in addition higher level of hcv infection in hepatocytes induced higher level of endoplasmatic reticulum stress and caused hcc carcinogenesis 37 in this scenario tlr2-del variant which was related to a diminished expression of tlr2 level and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines increased the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment and the risk of hcc development 8 13 38 consistently tlr2 knock-down tlr2 mice showed enhanced inflammation hepatic lesions and hcc progression after carcinogenic diethylnitrosamine exposure 9 39 moreover the tlr2 deldel condition resulted more frequently detected in our hcc patients than in other hcv-related diseases figure 2 data were in agreement with those observed in the hcv german population with an increased risk of hcc associated with the tlr2-del variant 13 on the other hand our multivariate analysis showed that il28b cc genotype was associated with a higher viral load table 5 and that the dominant wild-type haplotype tlr2 insins-il28b cc correlated with lymphoproliferative diseases but also with bds table 4 likewise previous studies have shown that hcv-core protein triggering tlr2 leaded to an increased in b-cell proliferation in vitro 18 thus considering that hcv is also a lymphotropic virus our haplotype analysis pointed out that in the presence of a hcv chronic persistence the tlr2 insins-il28b-cc arrangement could increase the susceptibility to lymphoproliferative complications including mixed cryoglobulinemia and b-cell nhl p  0029 or 177 table 4 in addition the tlr2 insins-il28b-cc haplotype not only showed a potential protective effect against hcv infection but also an association with older patients having a liver diseases cir and hcc figure 3 thus suggesting that the protective effect associated with this haplotype decreased with age in conclusion our study emphasizes that both tlr2 and il28b polymorphisms may have a role in directing hcv-progression towards hepatic or lymphoproliferative diseases thus the analysis of our hcv-positive population stratified by the two immunological variables indicated a potential protective effect of the il28b-c allele in homozygosity il28b-cc towards chronic infection and liver diseases and that the simultaneous presence of at least one tlr2-del allele abolished this effect in accordance with this result the tlr2-deldel state appeared closely linked with hcc condition conversely the dominant wild-type haplotype tlr2 insins-il28b cc associated with a better spontaneous resolution of the infection was also found more frequently in both bds as well as in hcv-related lymphoproliferative disorders compared to chc suggesting that in patients with a lymphoproliferative disease additional factors may be involved that obstacle the elimination of the virus therefore our findings shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the persistence of hcv infection and hcv-related disease progression a deeper understanding of these processes may lead to development of strategies based on the combination of conventional therapies with immune-mediated strategies for the treatment of hcv-related diseases we considered 862 patients with chronic hcv-infection and 77 healthy blood donors the ethnic background of patients was caucasic without hbv or hiv

predilection for nosocomial transmission notably to health care workers and to a lesser extent patients and visitors of the 8422 persons infected worldwide 1725 20 of them were health care workers
1
 in areas most badly affected by sars the proportion of health care worker to all cases was highest in vietnam 57 followed by canada 43 singapore 41 hong kong china 22 mainland china 19 and taiwan china 13
1
 in hong kong among 156 persons affected in a major nosocomial outbreak of sars 53 34 were patients initially hospitalized for other reasons and visitors
2
 of the 128 identified cases in a nosocomial outbreak in toronto 14 were visitors and another 14 were hospital patients
3
 in hospital settings the majority of these transmissions occurred when infection control precautions either had not been adequately instituted or had been instituted but were not meticulously complied with
2
 
4

 there is no doubt that early isolation of patients with probable or suspected sars is important to prevent nosocomial spread of the disease
5
 however a difficulty for frontline clinicians in the months of living with sars especially those in asia was how to make a clinical diagnosis at the time of patient presentation at this time a pointofcare diagnostic tool for sars is still lacking despite some early optimism on the molecular tests
6
 
7
 in the first few days following onset of symptoms nucleic acid detection by polymerase chain reaction only has a limited sensitivity
8
 although it appears that most patients with sars will mount an antibody response to sarscov less than half of the patients will have detectable antibody response in the first week of illness in most patients the sars illness begins with a nonspecific prodrome of fever chills myalgia and cough
9
 after 37 days the disease evolves into a form of rapidly progressive atypical pneumonia unless there is a history of close contact with a person having suspected or probable sars it is virtually impossible to be sure whether one is dealing with sars or an ordinary form of respiratory tract infection the strategy for admission and triage of patients with respiratory symptoms at the queen mary hospital during the months of sars is depicted in fig 1 the system was put into effect on 15 march three days after an outbreak of sars was found in hong kong as with most public hospitals in this region there are only a few private rooms for isolation of patients with communicable disease hence one patient floor including five wards was evacuated and designated as triage sars and stepdown areas each of the wards was divided into four or six bays separated by solid or glass partitions extending on either side of a central nursing station a dedicated team of physicians and nurses led by experienced respiratory and infectious diseases doctors was established to provide care to all patients admitted to the designated areas at the emergency department all new cases and transferins from other hospitals were systematically evaluated and were admitted to the triage ward when predetermined criteria were met table 1 in the triage ward patients underwent evaluation for sars including sars tests and repeat cxr or computer tomography all patients with a clinical diagnosis of communityacquired pneumonia were treated with a lactam and a macrolide in accordance with recommended guidelines
10
 to minimize the risk of cross transmission in the triage ward the number of beds in each bay was reduced to allow for a minimum bedtobed distance of 2 m furthermore patients were promptly moved to either the sars ward or the stepdown ward as soon as possible for continued care observation and isolation importantly an active surveillance was implemented in the general wards to identify and promptly isolate any unrecognized cases of sars in the emergency department triage stepdown and sars areas stringent infection control measures recommended for sars were implemented
11
 standard contact and droplet precautions were enforced in all other clinical areas in the hospital where medically feasible all admitted patients were instructed to wear a surgical mask from 15 march 2003 until hong kong was declared sarsfree on 23 june 2003 a total of 710 patients were admitted to the triage wards including 52 cases subsequently confirmed as having probable sars thus approximately 14 patients were put into isolation for every case of sars identified with this approach there were no cases of nosocomial transmission to patients hospitalized for other reasons and staff infection was only minimal out of 386 infected health care workers in hong kong only two were from the queen mary hospital at this time the transmission of sars appears to occur predominantly by large droplet direct contact with infectious material or by contact with fomites contaminated by infectious material
3
 
12
 in a study by seto et al it was shown that practice of droplet and contact precautions is adequate in most clinical settings to significantly reduce the risk of infection after exposures to patients with sars
4
 of 69 staff who reported consistent use of all four measures including mask gloves gowns and handwashing none were infected whereas all infected staff had omitted at least one measure
4
 however uncertainties continue on whether the disease could be transmitted by the airborne route in hospital settings potential airborne transmissions were all reported in association with certain coughinducing or aerosolgenerating procedures on two occasions the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and nebulised medications on patients unrecognized as having sars have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks
2
 
13
 in one instance in association with drug nebulization preliminary investigation indicated that airborne transmission is plausible although alternative explanations have been proposed and are being validated concerns have also been raised over possible airborne transmission during coughinducing procedures in three instances of patient intubation transmission to staff occurred when droplet and contact precautions were used
3
 
14

 one important lesson from sars concerns the need to enhance infection control programmes in hospitals in the longer term planning for sars should be put into a larger context to include not only sars but also other emerging infections such as avian influenza dengue and the results of bioterrorism in asia the state of development of infection control programmes varies among the countries in some hospitals the infrastructure for such programmes is still inadequate the problem is not simply the lack of resources as we have seen how countries could respond quickly by mobilizing and deploying means to contain sars rather it is a lack of awareness of the importance of preventing nosocomial infections and a lack of health care commitment to make such programmes an essential element of quality practice the high nosocomial transmission rate of sars has highlighted the need for us to revisit a few basic principles in the practice of infection control table 2 surveillance has been defined as the continuing scrutiny of all aspects of the occurrence and spread of disease that are pertinent to effective control
15
 it consists of data collection analysis of the data and feedback of the results to staff and others involved in decisionmaking a good programme is essential to recognise sars detect disease trends clarify rumours and to assess the efficacy of control measures given the fact that clustering of respiratory tract illness among hospital staff is a prominent feature of sars there is a need to enhance surveillance of infection in staff before the era of sars few hospital staff would bother to report minor respiratory illness wear a mask or take a day off for what appears to be a common cold this attitude will need careful reconsideration as taiwans experience clearly demonstrated that a sarscov infected staff member remaining on duty while the disease was still mild and nonspecific and couldnt be recognized as sars could initiate a large healthcare outbreak
16

 the risk of nosocomial infections is increased if patient care procedures are not properly performed and notably if infection control measures are not adequately followed the same probably holds for sars
4
 the importance of hand hygiene cannot be overemphasized yet compliance with hand hygiene has often been low being practiced only 4050 of the times when it is indicated
17
 in the context of sars each institute should review their hand hygiene policies and introduce means to ensure a high compliance among staff moreover our experience with handling sars indicates that lesser informed staff can lapse into inappropriate practice when facing the unknown issues that surround sars personal protective equipment should be properly worn and discarded carefully after use gloves should not be washed and reused between patients washing gloved hands is not effective for decontamination
18
 five to 50 of hands were contaminated after gloves were removed hence handwashing after glove removal is important we consider a glove all the time policy in providing care for probable sars case as suboptimal if staff wear gloves all the time they will wash their hands less often instead we have been recommending a gloves when needed but wash hands at every opportunity policy by putting emphasis on facetoface interactions with staff and with constant reinforcement we are able to keep handwashing compliance at high levels in our hospital being 100 in the isolation wards throughout and 78 to 95 in the general wards unpubl data most outbreaks of nosocomial sars have been associated with delays in recognizing the disease as sars usually this occurred for the very first cases in a hospital this provides a reminder of the need to be vigilant and that hand washing standards either singularly or in combination with transmissionbased precautions should be empirically implemented in the care of all patients in areas where sars might reemerge contact and droplet precautions should be implemented for the care of all patients with undiagnosed upper and lower respiratory tract infections patient care procedures particularly those that might induce patient coughing or generate infectious aerosols should be carefully assessed and planned before implementation and be evaluated afterwards a good infection control programme should be supported by adequate staffing according to the senic project there should be at least one fulltime infection control nurse for every 250 beds
19
 this standard however is still not reached in many asian countries there is also a need to develop surge capacity for infection control within hospital knowing that a nosocomial outbreak of sars could be explosive for this purpose one could build upon existing infection control liaison nurse programme in some hospitals
20

 many unanswered questions remain with respect to the mode of transmission period of infectivity effectiveness of and compliance with infection control practices the rapid surge of sars cases made it impossible to conduct prospective studies to address many of the above questions in hospital settings it is at least known that heightened infection control precautions empirical isolation of suspected cases aggressive contact tracing and quarantine of the contacts are effective in halting even large outbreaks of nosocomial sars
3
 as sars might reemerge it is critical that hospital workers now review and repair deficiencies in their infection control programmes  valuation of air pollution externalities comparative assessment

valuations of morbidity- and mortality-related damages of ap are carried out and explained in the results and discussion section in order to understand the true magnitude of the damages it is compared to economic damages sustained during the lockdown the prevention of ap provided a benefit at the cost of economic damage for this economic damage sustained by each city during the lockdown is calculated and compiled as shown in table 7 the gross domestic product gdp of the city is compared with the gdp of the country to understand the citywide damages as literature only reported country-level damages ambient air quality for delhi london paris and wuhan cities for the lockdown month with the number of days for the years 2019 and 2020 as shown in table 1 is considered for calculating the health damage cost due to air pollutants during the lockdown days due to limited transportation and industrial output air pollution is significantly reduced wang et al 2020b some of the air pollutants came within the world health organization who guidelines jordan 2020 just a few days into the lockdown no2 concentration for all the cities during the lockdown is less than the who limit every day whereas breach is observed for the year 2019 pollutant such as pm25 pm10 nox and so2 results in various health damages such as respiratory diseases copd cardiovascular diseases and mortality these pollutants are considered to calculate corresponding health damage cost it can be observed that so2 concentration was below the acceptable permissible limit set by international guidelines who 2006 hence no health damage due to pollutant was considered the daily mean of pm25 pm10 and daily averages for no2 during the month of lockdown days in 2020 and the same month for the previous year 2019 was found beyond the acceptable limit thereby health damage assessment is carried out by certain set of formulas eqs 13 maji et al 2017 in order to quantify the impacts in monetary terms it is essential to understand the mechanism by which the impact happens the impact pathway approach bherwani et al 2019 ghorani-azam et al 2016 reveals how emitted pollutants lead to different adverse outcomes on human wellbeing and other natural environments in the current research we are primarily focusing on human health impacts of ap and the same is quantified in monetary terms basic parameter of the number of people affected under morbidity and mortality are calculated using eqs 13 using the available data the factors for each of the pollutant parameter are taken from table 2 the reference concentration for the pollutants is taken from the who guidelines the cases of morbidity and mortality under each heading of disease for each city are summarized in table 8 while standard deviations have been reported in pollutant concentration relative risks and baseline incidences the resolution of calculation for multiplicative parameters using standard deviation may yield complex variations in the results hence the morbidity and mortality assessments have been done on average values from table 8 it can be seen that pm25 is the most damaging parameter affecting many people in all cities the highest cases are reported in delhi due to pm however no cases due to no2 in 2019 since it has the highest number of cases to start with the lockdown indicates the highest reduction as well while this will hold true for monetary benefit as well or not is discussed later wuhan indicates the second-highest number of people affected however reduction in 2020 appears to be low london and paris show a similar size of cases figure 2 indicates the morbidity and mortality between the two years 2019 and 2020 the valuation of morbidity is carried out for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases including general respiratory ailments asthma and copd coi is used to include the expenditure of treatment including the outpatient and in-patient costs related to the ailment the coi for each city based on national averages have been used for diseases as indicated in table 6 the valuation of the cost of treatment of morbidity is evaluated using eq 6 apart from the treatment expenditure the reduction in functionality of an individual also leads to massive losses to the economy this is often evaluated as daly and is valued as well for valuation per capita income is used as a surrogate measure for the individuals getting effected along with dalys associated with their diseases the data related to daly and per capita income based on city gdp averages is given in table 4 and table 5 respectively the daly-related valuation is carried out using eq 5 the morbidity valuation is shown in table 9 while fig 3 represents a comparative loss of all cities due to ap morbidity in the years 2019 and 2020 it can be seen from fig 3 that the highest benefit in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of percentage reduction of about 38 is seen by delhi which also happens to be one of the most polluted cities in the world the lockdown scenario must have brought down the pollution levels drastically bringing a huge benefit to the city in terms of change paris also sees a considerable reduction with morbidity damages reduced by almost 35 the city of wuhan and london see a similar kind of drop in terms of percentage reduction of about 19 to 20 while the morbidity damages are in millions of dollars it is evident that they have reduced considerably as compared to the previous year indicating that the lockdown has improved air quality thereby saving of millions of dollars and more importantly an improved health and associated intangibles mortality valuation is done using vsl which is usually evaluated for low- to moderate-income groups in order to avoid overshooting the valuations the value of statistical life for individuals staying in different countries is given in table 3 and is used for the mortality cases as evaluated by the relative risk and baseline incidences reported by who table 10 gives the mortality valuation under each category of disease for the respective pollutants the equation used for valuation for mortality damages is given in the methodology section as eq 4 figure 4 gives a year-wise comparison of the benefits produced by lockdown in 2020 in terms of mortality reduction it is to be noted that mortality damages are reported as total mortality and within that there is respiratory and cardiovascular mortality the total mortalities of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide have been added to get the total value of damage related to mortality which then further includes mortalities related to other factors of ap a similar result is obtained as in case of morbidity delhi has the greatest benefit with almost 49 reduction in damages related to mortality due to lockdown followed by paris with 39 reduction london with 29 and wuhan having 26 reduction further in terms of absolute numbers the reduction of damages is highest in delhi followed by london wuhan and paris respectively overall mortality and morbidity represent the total loss due to ap in the select cities the damages have been added and compared to the economic damages caused during the considered lockdown of these cities the economic damages have been reported at the country level the ratio of the gdps of the corresponding cities is taken to normalize the damages for cities the raw data with respect to economic damages and gdp ratios are given in table 7 the overall damages and economic damages are shown in table 11 valuation of ap damages for 2019 and 2020 gives an understanding of the magnitude of damages which occurs due to ap due to lockdown there is a drastic reduction in ap as indicated by 2020 scenario in table 8 and table 11 leading to the prevention of ap-related damages it can be seen from table 11 that the highest prevention happens in terms of absolute magnitude and percentage in delhi london has the second-highest amount of prevention in terms of absolute numbers but falls behind paris in terms of percentage benefit wuhan has the lowest prevention in terms of magnitude and percentage when compared with the economic damages as indicated in fig 5 above actually wuhan has the highest normalized benefit due to ap reduction followed by delhi london and paris respectively this is evidently shown in terms of damage prevented per unit economic damage which is highest for wuhan 185 followed by delhi 119 london 011 and paris 003 this study highlights that although the world is fighting with covid-19 and suffering from huge economic losses due to reduced cohesive situation for work the environment is benefitted this further is demonstrated in monetary terms for reduced health damages related to air pollution the exposure and impact assessment is carried out for delhi london paris and wuhan using relative risk and baseline indices of various air pollutants including pm25 pm10 and no2 the study further incorporates monetization of the impacts for 2019 and 2020 to gauge the magnitude of impact reduction of air pollution under covid-19 lockdown scenario the monetary assessment of damages is done using econometric approaches like vsl coi and pci for daly the key conclusions are summarized as followspm25 is one of the major contributors to the burden of disease related to ap delhi being one of the most polluted cities globally is the worst affected pm10 and no2 impacts are also considerable while so2 is found within who guidelines limits for both 2019 and 2020 monetarily the impact is curtailed by average 36 in mortality and about 28 in morbidity in the year 2020 due to substantial reduction in ap amid reduced anthropogenic activities owing to covid-19 lockdown in terms of an absolute number of people affected an average 31 reduction is for combined mortality and morbidity for all cities impacts of no2 are zeroed for the year 2020 for pm25 mortality cases delhi sees the highest fall in the number of cases for 2020 from 2019 followed by paris wuhan and london in that ordermorbidity damages estimated using coi and pci for daly indicates that exposure impact is highest for delhi followed by wuhan paris and london for 2019 reporting damages worth 1673 m million usd 2019 1345 m 1076 m and 759 m respectively a major reduction in morbidity damages is seen in delhi in 2020 because of lockdown revealing reduction of damages worth 643 m with paris falling in second place with 384 m worth of reduction trailed by wuhan and london at 255 m and 155 m reductions respectively this indicates that lockdown has affected cities differently indicating there are potentially other factors like geographic location background concentration seasonality and meteorological parameters playing a major role in alleviating the damageswhile morbidity damages are in millions of dollars the mortality damages extend that to multiple order of magnitudes the 2019 estimates suggest that the absolute mortality damages are highest for delhi at 128 billion usd b 2019 and achieved a maximum reduction of 49 in 2020 lockdown the damages in london are recorded as second highest at 7 b however the recovery is second lowest at 29 second to wuhan having recovery of 26 wuhan suffered damage of 35 b in 2019 and 26 b in 2020 paris had the lowest damages of 11 b in 2019 and made a reduction of about 39 in 2020 it can be seen the trend in mortality damages between the cities is not similar to morbidity indicating that there could be other compounding factors like age life expectancy and standard of living in these citiesthe total of morbidity and mortality damages reduction in 2020 is compared with the economic damages being reported for the cities it is reported that london 186b suffered maximum economic damage during its respective lockdown days while wuhan suffered the lowest 056b paris 1581b and delhi 536b suffered the second-highest and lowest damages respectively delhi london wuhan and paris prevented ap damages worth 64b 209b 097b and 047 b respectively in 2020 this indicates that wuhan and delhi could extract better worth from prevention of damages from lockdown as compared to their lockdown losses this might be due to the fact that both these cities are highly polluted as compared to paris and london and are economically developing as well wuhan is actually higher as the economic damages incurred by that city are the lowest the lowest recovery is made by paris while london stands at second-lowest it is apparent that while quantifying ap damages in terms of exposure and affected population is fruitful there are more insights which can be explored to understand the true magnitude of the damage caused by it the monetary evaluation gives a common denomination for comparison and for making a rational decision for policy formulation the above research of four major global cities demonstrates that while the world is suffering from enormous economic damage the lockdown has created some positive for the air environment and hence the human health as well while the above analysis might hold true for the majority of the cities suffering from a probable of ap a detailed analysis should be carried out for the respective city before making decisions accounting of the cost and benefits due to halting of anthropogenic activities gives us a clear indication of the change of damage being incurred on the ecosystem and on human health it further suggests that stronger policies are needed to safeguard the ecosystem

diseases autorif database using enrichr website to evaluate phenotypes associated with ace2 interaction in different tissues it enabled us to identify the disease traits which would be helpful in precise identification of the risk groups of patients with covid-19 this analysis guides the identification of phenotypes which can be triggered by ace2-network alterations in selected tissues moreover the analysis of rare traits enabled us to precisely characterise the consequences of alterations in the groups of ace2-network related genes the analysis of non-cancerous diseases in the disgenet database revealed that the highest number of genes from all analyzed networks was associated with following disease phenotypes in the decreasing order obesity hypertensive disease non-insulin dependent dm congestive hf coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis and were observed in all analyzed networks  figure 5a  enriched terms not enriched in virus-related network but containing virusinfection related genes were alzheimers disease heart failure diabetes mellitus asthma and rheumatoid arthritis the analysis focused on 11 virus-infection related proteins and diseases shared with other networks except for diseases mentioned in the last paragraph revealed that the most significant ones were sars virus diseases mi and arteriosclerosis  figure 5a  additional enrichment analysis of rare disease terms is shown in figure 5b  ace2 network related mirna predictions we found 1954 mirnas regulating components of the ace2 interaction network in further analyses we put special focus on mirnas which regulated the highest number of the genes from the network as well including ace2 analysis of top 10 mirnas regulating each network complete network heart lung nervous

virus-related network but containing virusrelated genes were kallikrein hypertension aortic coarctation coarctation of aorta dominant plasma thromboplastin antecedent deficiency mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis goodpasture syndrome eclampsia and hyperoxaluria analysis focused on 11 virus-related proteins and diseases shared with other networks showed that the most significant were except for mentioned ones also krabbe leukodystrophy in the current study we characterized the interaction between sars-cov-2 infection and ace2 functional networks with a focus on cvd using data mining and bioinformatic tools we described the ace2 interaction network and evaluated its expression the main findings of this analysis are the following 1 expression of ace2 is similar in lungs and heart which provides a rationale why the cardiovascular system is also a target of sars-cov-2 infection 2 change in the heart-relevant ace2 interaction network by sars-cov-2 binding to the receptor likely leads to disturbances in signaling pathways linked to cardiac adverse outcomes 3 genes which are altered in patients with cardiovascular risk factors as dpp4 ccl2 and anpep are extensively connected with top regulators of the ace2 network 4 specific mirnas mir-302c-5p mir-1305 mir-587 mir-26b-5p and mir-27a-3p are shared as top regulators between the heart-specific network complete ace2 network virus-infection related proteins network lung and nervous system networks recently published studies suggested that the highest expression of ace2 was found in the digestive tract followed by testis and kidney 31 32 our analysis shows the highest expression of ace2 in the genitourinary tract and related tissues moreover we found in the genitourinary tract the highest co-expression of tmprss2 gene that is known to positively regulate viral entry into the host cell via proteolytic cleavage of ace2 our analysis also supports the findings of a previous study using integrated analyses of single-cell atlases showing a high expression of ace2 in ventricular cardiomyocytes heart macrophages and pericytes of the heart lung and kidney 33 therefore the disturbances in the ace2 interaction network by sars-cov-2 binding in the ace2 receptor on cardiomyocytes might explain cardiac abnormalities presented in covid-19 patients including elevated troponin myocarditis and sudden cardiac death 34 moreover as myocardial complex interaction network of ace and its own expression is increased in patients with coexisting cvd sars-cov-2 infection may result in greater damage to cardiomyocytes and account for greater disease acuity and poorer survival in these patients our analysis of ace2 interaction network as well as analysis only focused on heart-tissue specific genes showed that change in ace2 receptor activity can lead to significant disturbances in signaling pathways linked to wellknown complications in covid-19 disease those pathways included ras age-rage signaling pathway in diabetic complications neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction innate immune system neutrophil degranulation and intrinsic pathway of clot formation moreover signaling pathways identified as specific for the heart-relevant ace2 interaction network were associated with adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes foxo2 signaling pathway relaxin signaling pathway platelet degranulation and vegfr2 mediated vascular permeability in these networks the closest interactors of ace2 were ren ins kng1 and agt those results were supported by our subsequent analysis showing that genes from the ace2 network have strongest connection with rare diseases related to high blood pressure respiratory diseases ie sars and goodpasture syndrome renal diseases coagulation disorders and several phenotypes like obesity hypertension dm that are known to be a risk factors for severe course of covid-19  moreover in our in silico analysis using ace2 functional networks we found that rasace2 age-rage and apelin signaling pathways play an important role in sars-cov-2 infection these pathways have a crucial role in pathogenesis of dm cvd and blood pressure regulations therefore binding of the sars-cov-2 to the ace2 receptor leading to disturbances in the pathways of these key regulators might explain the adverse outcome in covid-19 patients with coexistence of cvd abnormalities of ace2ras pathway signaling and deregulation of angiotensin ii as a fundamental mediator of this axis are closely related to pathophysiology of hypertension and progression of cardiovascular remodeling 35 furthermore increased ace2 expression attenuates hypertension-linked pathophysiological changes and protects against elevated blood pressure whereas loss of ace2 function exacerbates hypertension 36 apelin signaling is involved in many physiological processes such as energy metabolism blood pressure regulation and cardiac contractility and plays an important role in organ and tissue pathologies including dm obesity hf as well as hiv-1 infection 37 in vitro analysis showed that apelin is a second catalytic substrate for ace2 and it can effect as an inotropic and cardioprotective peptide 38 39 thromboembolic complications in covid-19 the role of kng1 one of the top ace2 interactors in this study we found a strong connection between ace2 and kng1 which as a part of kalikrein-kinin system kks encoding precursors of kinins 40 kks mediators are involved in vessel wall remodeling intimal hyperplasia 41 and affect nitric oxide and prostacyclin production 42 moreover high molecular weight kininogen hk is essential in surface-binding and activity of factor xi a component of intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation 43 plasma kininogen may induce the development of arterial thrombosis especially under pathologic conditions 44 2-chain hka was also found to inhibit pai-1 function interfere with platelet activation and mediate platelet-leukocyte interaction 45 46 and therefore deregulation of kks may result in thromboembolic complications and lead to sepsis exacerbation in infections 47 48 49 pro-inflammatory cytokines modulated by ace2 a putative mechanism for generalized inflammatory response several experimental studies indicated that ace2 is able to modify acute and chronic inflammatory response 50 51 in line we found in our analysis a strong interaction of ace2 with several genes related with inflammatory response including ccl2 and tgfb1 loss of function of ace2 in mutant mice resulted in enhanced production of inflammatory cytokine and collagenase levels increased ros neutrophilic infiltration and mapk activation 52 diminished ace2 function may deregulate ras and induce inflammation and vessel permeability and lung edema 53 it is worth to mention that among sars-cov-infected patients the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines especially ccl2 and tgf-1 were increased in cells expressing ace2 while this could not be seen in tissue with undetectable ace2 expression 54 a comparable pattern of inflammatory cytokines was found in sars-cov-2 infection as well 55 the role of virus-infection related proteins from ace2 network in covid-19 adverse outcomes additional analysis of ace2 interaction network identified 11 virus-infection related proteins involved in significantly enriched pathways three of them ace2 clec4m and tmprss2 directly interact with virus glycoprotein s we identified 10 virus-infection related proteins in the heart-specific interaction network except for tmprss2 suggesting that the heart tissue could be capable of being as strongly affected as the respiratory system three of those genes dpp4 ccl2 and anpep showed especially extensive connections with top regulators of the network interestingly higher plasma dpp4 can be found among patients with obesity metabolic syndrome and dm who are at risk of a severe course of covid-19 56 moreover in experimental models of ards dpp4 inhibitors suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production and attenuated lps-induced lung injury 57 dpp4 knockin mice were found more susceptible to mers-cov infections which resulted in severe inflammatory response and lethal lung disease 58 59 therefore it should be further investigated whether dpp4 inhibitors widely used for the treatment of dm may act as therapeutic drugs for ards caused by sars-cov-2 infection 60 interestingly dpp4 inhibitors are able to at least partially reverse the olfactory dysfunction observed in dm suggesting that dpp4 pathway may be involved in anosmia which occurs commonly among covid-19 patients 61 62 this evidence show that dpp4 could be a crucial factor in regulation of multiple pathological processes associated with covid-19 second crucial cytokine in the network is the chemokine ccl2 also referred to as mcp-1 it has been shown that the ccl2 expression was increased among patients infected with sars-cov 63 64 possibly ace2 mediates viral entry and leads to activation of erk12ap-1 pathway and upregulation of ccl2 ccl2 protein has been implicated in lung inflammatory disorders and contributes to development of pulmonary fibrosis 19 65 besides in the late stage of disease ccl2 expression levels are constantly elevated among severe sars patients in comparison to non-severe controls and associated with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates higher body temperatures and longer hospitalization 66 it is worth to mention that among sars-cov-infected patients the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines especially ccl2 and tgf-1 were increased in cells expressing ace2 while this could not be seen in tissue with undetectable ace2 expression 54 a comparable pattern of inflammatory cytokines was found in sars-cov-2 infection as well 55 significant association of the ccl2 with malaria disease pathway in our study target of chloroquine a potent anti inflammatory agent regulating also ace2 and ins make it a promising link between ace2 and cytokine storm associated with severe covid-19 disease the third gene with extensive ace2 network connection anpep encodes aminopeptidase n apn cd13 which similarly to ace2 and ddp2 is also recognized as a target for coronavirus named hcov-22944 67 apn plays a role in inflammatory response by regulating the activity of various hormones chemokines and cytokines and was found to be increased in some inflammatory diseases 68 apn may influence on controlling blood pressure by regulating the metabolism of ang iii 69 in the next step of our study we searched for mirnas that may regulate expression of ace2 networks and related processes our prediction model revealed that mir-302c-5p mir-1305 mir-587 mir-26b-5p and mir-27a-3p are top regulators of complete ace2 network heart-specific network as well as virus-infection related network to our best knowledge we present here novel results on a potential role of mirnas as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in heart muscle injury in the course of sars-cov-2 infection mir-1305 and mir-587 tgf- signaling pathway regulators in hf progression mir-1305 and mir-587 were found to regulate the expression of tgf- pathway members smad3 and smad4 70 71 smad3 negatively regulates the inflammatory response and modulates t-cell activation 72 the tgf-smad signaling pathway has been directly related to viral infections 73 moreover this pathway deregulation has been also implicated to ventricular remodeling myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy and as a result hf progression 74 the highest expression of mir-587 was found in platelets of patients with acute coronary syndrome and was closely related to the severity of coronary artery stenosis 75 mir-26b-5p anti-fibrotic agent and agtr1-dependent hypertension modulator in our study we found that mir-26b-5p may play an important role in pathogenesis of hf in covid-19 patients as showed by an interaction of ace2 with enpep agt ccn2 calm1 ccl2 and agtr1 noteworthy previous study showed that in the mirna-differentially expressed genes deg regulatory network hsa-mir-26b-5p was one of the most important mirna and agtr1 was the most outstanding up-regulated degs in the ppi network 76 it has been suggested that agtr1 can modulate hypertension via the regulation of mir-26b-5p in arachidonic acid metabolism the anti-fibrotic effect of mir-26b-5p was shown in the liver in the diabetic mouse myocardium and in ang-ii-induced mouse cardiac fibroblasts  77 mir-302c-5p potential antiviral therapeutic and biomarker of hf another regulating mirna from our network was mir-302c-5p playing an important role in many viral infections 78 79 80 a study reported an association between the mir-302 kpna2 axis and ev71-related cytokine storm and showed the potential of mir-302 as an antiviral therapeutic 80 our bioinformatic analysis for the first time showed the importance of mir-302c-5p in sars-cov-2 infection apart from the crucial function of mir-302 in viral infections it may be also associated with cvd 8182 as circulating mir-302 was positively correlated with nt-probnp levels in acute hf patients and showed strong potential as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and the differentiation of disease severity of acute hf 81 mir-27a-3p a potential biomarker of acute hf and nf-b signaling regulator also mir-27a-3p was found to be involved in inflammatory response and oxidative stress through several pathways including ppar- nf-b and pi3k aktnrf2 signaling 83 84 85 in animal model of acute lung injury expression of mir-27a-3p in alveolar macrophages was significantly decreased while overexpression of mir-27a-3p suppressed nf-b activation and alleviated acute lung injury by binding to its target nfkb1 83 moreover it was also found that mir-27a-3p may target pathways related to atherosclerosis and may act as a potential biomarker of acute hf 86 87  this comprehensive analysis provides novel information regarding the complexity of signaling pathways of sars-cov-2 infection affecting the cardiovascular system and forms a basis for a creation of predictive tools and introduction of therapy to improve outcome in covid-19 and therefore has a potential to reduce economic consequences of the global pandemic we believe that the results of our analysis could be further validated in laboratory and clinical settings and help to create a paradigm for future studies in this field mirnas identified for the first time in this study can serve as potential biomarkers helping with identification of the pathological changes in covid-19 or serve as therapeutic targets due to their stability in the serum forming a basis for personalized therapy in patients with or at risk for cvd as those with obesity dm or hypertension suffering from

benjamin tenoever r todd evans robert schwartz e shuibing chen   covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 respiratory failure is the most common mortality outcome in covid-19 patients yet serious and even fatal manifestations are seen across multiple organ systems including the heart mehra et al 2020 brain helms et al 2020 pleasure et al 2020 and gastrointestinal tract goyal et al 2020 in one retrospective study of more than 400 covid-19 patients nearly 20 had suffered in-hospital cardiac injury which was a significant independent risk factor for mortality shi et al 2020 nearly 25 of patients have gastrointestinal manifestations including anorexia diarrhea vomiting and abdominal pain and these symptoms are associated with worse covid-19 outcomes pan et al 2020 a recent clinical study among 7300 covid-19 patients also showed a strong correlation between poor covid-19 outcomes and type 2 diabetes zhu et al 2020 recent clinical studies suggest that diabetes is not only a risk factor for severe covid-19 disease but also that sars-cov-2 infection can induce new-onset diabetes bornstein et al 2020 currently there are no vaccines or effective treatment options for covid-19 due to limited knowledge of sars-cov-2 viral biology most current studies are based on clinical data immortalized cell lines or transgenic animals that express the human sars viral entry receptor ace2 unfortunately these in vitro eg african green monkey vero cells or human cancer cell lines and in vivo eg mice engineered to express ace2 models are sufficiently distinct from human biology that they are unlikely to capture key aspects of viral infection and virus-host interactions several human cancer lines including a549 calu3 hfl lung adenocarcinoma caco2 colorectal adenocarcinoma huh7 hepatocellular adenocarcinoma hela cervical adenocarcinoma 293t embryonic kidney u251 glioblastoma and rd rhabdomyosarcoma have been used to study sars-cov-2 infection and for drug evaluation chu et al 2020 hoffmann et al 2020 ou et al 2020 shang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however many human organs and tissues contain multiple cell types and ace2 the putative receptor of sars-cov-2 is heterogeneously expressed in different cell types thus using cancer cell lines might fail to appreciate the different cell types affected by sars-cov-2 infection in addition most of these human cancer cell lines carry tumor-associated mutations such as p53 mutations p53 has been shown to regulate sars-cov replication which raises concern for how these cancer cell lines recapitulate the viral biology of sars-cov-2 in normal non-transformed cells ma-lauer et al 2016 moreover certain cell lines such as huh75 have mutations in genes controlling the innate immune response a known defect in rig-i which may obscure antiviral responses and the subsequent viral life cycle as these cells are all cancer cell lines they have maintained their ability to proliferate and often are unpolarized which could impact several components of viral infection taken together it seems likely that these differences from primary cells and tissues will impact their ability to model sars-cov-2 infection as a consequence there is an urgent need to create models to study sars-cov-2 biology using human disease-relevant cells and tissues a human cell-based platform to study viral tropism would be a first step toward defining cell types permissive to sars-cov-2 infection and for modeling covid-19 disease across multiple organ systems human pluripotent stem cells hpscs including human embryonic stem cells hescs and induced pluripotent stem cells hipscs can be used to derive functional human cellstissuesorganoids for modeling human disease and drug discovery including for infectious diseases for example hpsc-derived neuronal progenitor cells hnpcs and brain organoids were used to study the impact of zika virus zikv on human brain development and the mechanistic link between zikv infection and microcephaly as reviewed wen et al 2017 hpsc-derived hnpcs were used to screen for anti-zikv drugs and identified emricasan as a pan-caspase inhibitor that protects hnpcs in addition to cyclin-dependent kinases and niclosamide that inhibit zikv replication xu et al 2016 similarly we performed a high content screen and identified an anti-zikv compound hippeastrine hydrobromide that suppressed viral propagation when administered to adult mice with active zikv infection highlighting its therapeutic potential zhou et al 2017 here we present a platform developed using hpscs to generate multiple different cell and organoid derivatives representative of all three primary germ layers we used these to systematically explore the viral tropism of sars-cov-2 and cellular responses to infection we used directed differentiation of hpscs to generate eight distinct cell types or organoids representing lineages from all three definitive germ layers figure 1

outbreak gunther eysenbach zhu zhang daniela paolotti maimuna majumder s mauricio santillana sumiko mekaru r denise mcginnis p kamran khan john brownstein s   recent infectious disease outbreaksincluding severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers ebola and influenza a h1n1have presented great challenges to the global public health community including lack of basic epidemiologic knowledge to support important preparedness and control decisions to address this gap innovative surveillance methods have been developed over the last several years to leverage the increasing availability of digital data related to outbreaks to date many studies have retrospectively examined nontraditional digital data sources and have demonstrated their utility in estimating epidemic curves or changes in important epidemiologic parameters over time 1-3 such studies have provided a foundation for building near real-time prospective analytic techniques that can assess transmission dynamics in the absence of traditional data these methodological developments fill a knowledge vacuum that may prove useful for public health decision making in the early stages of an outbreak the ongoing outbreak of zika virus disease in central and south america has attracted global attention due to its rapid geospatial growth as well as concerns over associated central nervous system complications 45 although zika virus is primarily transmitted via aedes mosquitoes evidence of vertical and sexual transmission exists 6-8 likely introduced to the americas in mid- to late 2013 the virus has since been propagated by the density of competent vectors throughout the region 8 at present approximately 40 countries in central and south america have experienced local vector-borne transmission resulting in nearly 300000 total reported cases to date 9 of the cases that have sought care thus far in the region about 70000 have been reported out of colombia of which 17 were pregnant at time of clinical or laboratory diagnosis 910 however given the generally mild nature of zika virus disease and subsequent lack of care seeking reported cases undoubtedly comprise a small fraction of total cases 1112 current prevention efforts focus on vector suppression 13 while interest in and efforts toward vaccine development are mounting rapidly due to increasing rates of guillain-barr syndrome following zika virus infection and microcephaly in newborn babies born to women infected with zika virus while pregnant 45 quantitative analyses designed to inform vaccine policiesin addition to other preparedness and control activitiesare dependent on the transmission dynamics associated with the disease and therefore estimates for critical epidemiologic parameters are urgently needed for such decision making within the context of zika virus disease in this paper we use nontraditional digital disease surveillance data via healthmap and google trends to develop near real-time estimates for the basic and observed reproductive numbers associated with zika virus disease in colombia as well as expected final outbreak size and duration we then validate our results against traditional health care-based disease surveillance data and discuss the implications of our work on outbreak mitigation strategies in colombia and assessment of transmission dynamics elsewhere in the region cumulative reported case counts of zika virus disease in colombia were acquired via the healthmap digital disease surveillance system consisting of 28 unique nongovernmental media alerts between october 16 2015 and april 16 2016 14 the cumulative reported case curve obtained from these reports shows an unrealistic l-shape presumably due to increased interest in reporting during recent weeks and lack of awareness during early weeks figure 1 by assuming that the total number of cases obtained from healthmap was a reasonable approximation of reality for the given time period we used google search data to distribute cumulative reported case counts more realistically over time although many cases of dengue and influenza go undetected previous studies have shown that relevant google search trends demonstrate high linear correlation with reported disease incidence over time 1516 thus we obtained weekly google search fractions of the term zika from colombia via the google trends website accessed on april 29 2016 these search fractions are displayed weekly as normalized values that range from zero to 100 which reflect the level of nationwide search interest in the word zika from january 4 2004 first available datum to april 16 2016 we created a smoothed cumulative incidence curve referred to as smoothed healthmap by scaling the google search curve against the healthmap-reported zika cases 17 the scaling constant was obtained by dividing the most recent total number of healthmap-reported zika cases by the total number of google search fractions from may 31 2015 to april 16 2016 perhaps due to initial delays in reporting the first relevant uptick of the term zika in the google trends data occurred during the week of may 31 2015 approximately 20 weeks before the first healthmap alert of zika virus disease in colombia because of this may 31 2015 was selected as the start date for modeling efforts using smoothed healthmap data april 16 2016 last available datum at time of manuscript preparation was selected as the cut-off date due to successful applications in other data-scarce ie cumulative incidence only settings the incidence decay and exponential adjustment idea model was used to estimate the basic reproductive number r0 and the discount factor d associated with the ongoing outbreak 21819 both r0 and d were solved for using nonlinear optimization to minimize the sum of squared differences ssd between reported user-inputted and modeled cumulative incidence i curves across multiple serial intervals ie outbreak generations figure 2 presents a formulation for i expressed in terms of r0 and d where t is the number of outbreak generations ie serial intervals that have passed thus far and is inversely proportional to the serial interval length ie number of days per serial interval si given that distribution for the si associated with zika virus disease had not yet been established r0 and d were solved for iteratively over a range of 14 deterministic lengths 10-23 days 20 these values of r0 and d were then used to define maximum minimum and mean values for the observed reproductive number robs final reported outbreak size imax and final reported duration tmaxthe observed number of secondary infections per infected individual for a given value of t robs was calculated using the following equation robs  r01 dt when d is greater than zero r0 does not equal robs in such circumstances disease incidence is nonexponential due to either planned or unplanned reductions in disease duration contact rate or infectiousness of cases 18 likewise final reported outbreak duration tmax was calculated as follows 18 tmaxlnr0ln1 d final reported outbreak duration can also be expressed in days by multiplying tmax by si however in calculating imax original units ie outbreak generations are used figure 3 in the event that a viable vaccine is developed before the ongoing outbreak in colombia ends tmax the following equation was used to assess the percentage of the susceptible population that would need to be immunized against zika virus vax to eliminate transmission assuming 100 vaccine efficacy vax11 robs after completion of the analyses on the digital surveillance data we performed a validation study using traditional surveillance data obtained from weekly instituto nacional de salud ins national institute of health colombia epidemiological bulletin publications 21 the ins first reported incidence of zika virus disease in colombia on october 16 2015 however subsequent publications indicated that the outbreak likely began during epidemiologic week 32 of 2015 or earlier 22 as result august 22 2015 was selected as a start date for modeling efforts using ins data april 16 2016 date of the most recent publication at time of manuscript preparation was selected as the cut-off date 22 the analyses described previously for the smoothed healthmap dataset were conducted on the ins dataset as well resulting in r0 d robs imax tmax and vax estimates for both digital smoothed healthmap and traditional ins cumulative reported case data example model fits for both digital smoothed healthmap ssd147108 and traditional ins ssd155107 cumulative case data are shown in figures 4 and 5 si17 days in general the traditional data model fits mean ssd176107 were superior to those derived from digital data mean ssd164108 using the digital smoothed healthmap cumulative case counts we estimated a mean r0 of 326 range 191-505 and a mean d of 004 range 001-007 across 14 deterministic serial interval lengths range 10-23 days figure 6 we then calculated a mean robs of 163 range 131-205 a mean imax of 85546 cases range 80028-93885 cases and a mean tmax of 530 days range 522-538 days november 2016 cumulative reported case projections using these modeled parameters are shown in figure 7 the traditional ins data yielded a mean r0 of 536 range 252-963 and a mean d of 007 range 002-014 across 14 deterministic serial interval lengths range 10-23 days figure 8 using these we calculated a mean robs of 196 range 145-258 a mean imax of 77386 cases range 76587-78619 cases and a mean tmax of 387 days range 382-392 days september 2016 cumulative reported case projections using these modeled parameters are shown in figure 9 although r0 values calculated using the traditional ins data were general higher than those calculated using digital smoothed healthmap cumulative case counts ssd8214 robs values were quite similar across data sources ssd184 as a result the digital smoothed healthmap and traditional ins cumulative case data produced similar mean vax values of 039 range 024-051 and 049 range 031-061 respectively when depletion of susceptible individuals due to infection ie via death or immunity-conferred recovery is small relative to the total population basic reproductive numbers obtained using the idea model are comparable to simple sir-type models 19 although they are especially suitable for use in data-scarce settings sir-type modelsand by extension the idea modelcannot easily incorporate global dynamics such as the importation and exportation of infectious agents ie vectors and humans or significant climate events ie el nio and la nia nevertheless others have demonstrated that simple sir-type models perform similarly to complex mechanistic models when describing the transmission dynamics of vector-borne and water-borne diseases in localized contexts 2324 as a result the idea model is a reasonable method for analyzing nationwide transmission dynamics of zika virus disease in colombia as defined by the idea modeling method r0 represents potential transmissibility of a given pathogen in a fully susceptible nave population meanwhile robs represents observed transmission in the face of existing interventions as captured by d 21819 in this sense the robs is similar to the effective reproductive number rt which represents transmissibility in a population that is not fully susceptible mean modeled estimates for r0 across both data sources were consistent with r0 estimates for zika virus disease in french polynesia and with r0 estimates for chikungunya and dengue 122526 mean modeled estimates for robs were also comparable to rt estimates for chikungunya and dengue 2728 to take into account the effects of ongoing transmission control efforts robs was used instead of r0 to calculate vax in this study we found that using the traditional ins data yielded higher r0 estimates than the digital smoothed healthmap cumulative reported case counts nevertheless because estimates for d were also higher modeled ranges for robs and vax were comparable across both data sources similarly the narrow range of possible case projections generated by the traditional ins data was largely encompassed by the wider range produced by the digital smoothed healthmap cumulative reported case counts therefore in the absence of traditional health care-based surveillance data important epidemiologic parameters may be estimated using smoothed digital surveillance data as described here the methods used in this study are not without limitations for both data sources estimates for country-level case projections and imax apply only to those that seek care true caseloads are likely to be as much as five times higher than those that are reported 1112 furthermore because country-level data are utilized in-country transmission heterogeneities are not captured as geographic granularity of digital surveillance data improves similar analyses should be conducted at smaller scales nevertheless given that projection models are designed to serve as decision-support tools estimating the number of cases that will report to hospitals and clinics over the next several monthseven at the country levelis still valuable for the purposes of resource allocation this may be especially pertinent with respect to diagnostic support for pregnant women presenting with clinical symptoms for zika virus disease to date nearly 20 of all reported zika virus disease cases in colombia have been pregnant women if the current rate holds thousands more may be infected and seek care before the outbreak ends however the projections presented in this paper only apply in the event that circumstances remain unchanged eg no new interventions are put in place with improved compliance vector suppression interventions eg elimination of standing water exhaustive use of insect repellant have the potential to bring this outbreak to a swift close even in the absence of a vaccine in the event that a viable vaccine can be developed before the outbreak ends our estimates suggest that approximately half of the susceptible population would need to be immunized to confer herd immunity considering the growing body of evidence linking zika virus infection during pregnancy to microcephaly in newborn babies women of childbearing age should be given priority if the option becomes available 45 regardless of whether a vaccine reaches the market before the outbreak in colombia ends the data acquisition and modeling approach presented in this paper may still benefit other zika-affected countries with limited capacity for government-implemented health care-based data collection although traditional surveillance data should be used preferentially in its absence digital surveillance data can yield comparable estimates for key transmission parameters it has been shown that digital surveillance data can be used retrospectively to assess transmission dynamics of well-understood pathogens eg vibrio cholerae however our findings suggest that similar analyses can also be conducted in near real time for emerging infectious diseases 3 moreover the epidemiologic parameters estimates from these analyses may be readily updated as new information emerges enabling prospective tracking of transmission dynamics at the country level despite data scarcity recent history has shown the need for rapid epidemiologic assessments to better inform intervention strategies in the face of a public health emergency for effective evaluation of such interventions baseline estimates for transmissibilitylike those described in this studymust be established furthermore changes in outbreak dynamics must be closely monitored in order to assess the impact of active interventions on disease transmission our approach offers an important alternative to guesswork based loosely on related diseases and previous outbreaks given the absence of traditional surveillance data and transmission heterogeneities across central and south america digital surveillance data can and should be used to conduct similar analyses for other zika-affected countries in the months ahead  ambulatory care practice in the covid-19 era redesigning clinical services and experiential learning beaumont hospital  dearborn mi

appe as ambulatory care clinical pharmacists continue to expand the services they provide in response to covid -19 we also describe opportunities to promote pharmacists as providers during times of pandemic and into the future  the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 in the united states us was reported in washington state in january 2020 1 cases in the us continue to increase exponentially with several hotspots emerging throughout the country particularly within counties of new jersey new york michigan and washington 2 the surge of covid-19 cases has created numerous unprecedented challenges in the healthcare field in most areas across the country non-essential procedures have been halted and health systems are encouraged to provide remote patient care activities when possible both to promote social distancing and help flatten the curve 3 in the absence of clear consensus guidelines ambulatory practices have varied in their approaches to restructuring the delivery of care some practices have temporarily closed their doors while others remain open many of these open establishments are limiting face-to-face care to urgent visits only thus non-urgent visits require another method of care delivery at the same time a lack of access to routine healthcare during national emergencies and pandemics may lead to higher mortality rates for patients with chronic diseases 4 5 therefore swift and prudent implementation of practice changes have been important in providing continued medication management during the coronavirus pandemic ambulatory care clinical pharmacists provide accessible and coordinated healthcare services in various outpatient settings community pharmacies physicians officesclinics 6 positive clinical and financial outcomes across many chronic disease states have been associated with directed patient care services offered by ambulatory care clinical pharmacists 7 8 9 10 direct patient care services are often delivered under collaborative practice agreements and include comprehensive medication management cmm whereby pharmacists ensure each patients medications are appropriate effective achieving therapeutic goals safe and that medication regimens can be adhered to and taken as intended 11 as part of the cmm process the pharmacists can ensure medication access and thereby may enroll this article is protected by copyright all

required adaptability to provide direct patient care services while meeting the changing demands across healthcare systems 12 pharmacists in ambulatory care practices received rapid rates of information exchange regarding the virus and its transmission executive orders and reimbursement guides in addition to changes in clinical practice many simultaneously adapted their students advanced pharmacy practice experiences appe as educators collaborations between pharmacists across different ambulatory care practices can assist with modifying both clinical practices and appe as such a group of ambulatory care clinical pharmacists in detroit michigan quickly convened to form a workgroup this workgroup enabled timely information exchange support and guidance for redesigning ambulatory care practice models and appe the purpose of this paper is to highlight clinical and experiential challenges that ambulatory care clinical pharmacists have been facing generate discussion and provide examples of potential solutions that can serve as a framework for covid-19 ambulatory care practices and experiential sites during the covid-19 era ambulatory care clinical pharmacists are ensuring patient access to care supporting their care teams and easing the burden on the healthcare system these roles have become increasingly important following the institution and extension of stay-at-home orders ambulatory care clinical pharmacists are providing covid-19 education and triaging medication stewardship medication coordination and insurance coordination 13 to ensure continuity of care and provision of cmm pharmacists have quickly adapted to the urgent need for practice changes in practice with a shift to telehealth that consist of video andor telephone encounters this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved telehealth has been an emerging form of care delivery for pharmacists in recent years telehealth is a way to provide long-distance healthcare and education to patients by using electronic information and telecommunication technologies 14 15 this mode of service has been linked to a positive impact on outcomes related to clinical disease management patient self-management and adherence in the management of chronic diseases 16 numerous pharmacy organizations support the use of telehealth and recognize the future relevance of this practice for the profession the national association of boards of pharmacy and the american pharmacists association both have definitions of telehealth or telepharmacy that address operations and regulatory considerations 17 amidst covid-19 telehealth services have been scaled-up and have become the main mode of facilitating cmm services 3 21 given the guidance and experience many pharmacists have with telehealth they are well-positioned to meet the increased demands during this time of need ambulatory care clinical pharmacists can conduct either scheduled or ad hoc telehealth visits which typically include communication with patients via phone or video the scope of the pharmacists services provided should be consistent with the scope of practice in their respective states within the health system and as written in a collaborative practice agreement such services may include adjusting medication therapy ordering self-monitoring devices and laboratory monitoring providing education and designing a follow-up care plan in order to decrease risk of covid-19 exposure and transmission ambulatory care clinical pharmacists can utilize telehealth to promote and provide more frequent follow-up on patient selfmonitoring this can serve as a short-term alternative to office-based and laboratory monitoring while some patients may already have access to monitoring devices such as scales home blood pressure cuffs home blood glucose monitors and peak flow meters pharmacists can help facilitate access to these tools other devices such as point-of-care machines smart devices and continuous blood glucose monitors may provide additional information for patients who have access and meet specified criteria in cases where telehealth guided by self-monitoring is not sufficient or not an option ambulatory care clinical pharmacists have implemented solutions such as drive-up testing drive-up point-of-care monitoring and medication administration can keep patients from entering the clinic and minimize person-to-person exposure risk ambulatory care clinical pharmacists can offer this service to increase access and provide faster testing and treatment for patients one of the most widely implemented drive-up services being conducted during the pandemic is point-of-care international ratio inr testing for patients on warfarin therapy high quality anticoagulation management is important for patient safety and efficacy frequent inr monitoring often performed at intervals of one month or less is common for patients taking warfarin 22 therefore drive-up inr monitoring can offer timely evaluation for less stable patients where extended interval inr monitoring is not optimal there are additional recommended strategies for safe warfarin management during the pandemic these strategies are dependent on factors such as therapeutic stability clinical and economic feasibility of switching to an agent that does not require routine monitoring reasonable access to a clinical laboratory that can offer limited patient exposure or eligibility and access to home inr selftesting  figure 1  23 in addition to drive-up inr testing other monitoring or medication-related services may be delivered in a drive-up manner the public readiness and emergency preparedness act authorized pharmacists to order and administer covid-19 tests including serology tests during the national publichealth emergency 24 therefore covid-19 testing is an important drive-up or on-site service that pharmacists can provide at this time blood pressure monitoring for those needing antihypertensive this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved accepted article titration can also be performed through drive-up services furthermore patients requiring scheduled injections such as denusomab epoetin colony-stimulating factors or other such medications are good candidates for drive-up minimized contact care in response to covid-19 there have been expanded approvals of existing telehealth billing codes as well as the addition of new codes the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act the largest economic relief bill in us history became law on march 6 2020 25 the intention of this legislation was in part to loosen restrictions on telehealth and promote patient access to care as a result on march 17 2020 the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms introduced a waiver to ensure access to telehealth for covid-19 care as well as management of other chronic conditions 26 medicare has provided guidance on billing for telehealth which often serves as a standard for medicaid and commercial payors table 1  medicare specifically groups these opportunities into three categories telehealth using video virtual check-ins using phone or other technologies and e-visits using an online patient portal more recently cms has also allowed reimbursement for telephonic discussions without the use of video 2627 telehealth video visits require real-time audio and video for communication of note during the pandemic these visits are currently being paid at the same rate as in-person visits co-insurance and deductibles may still apply though medicare has indicated that coinsurance can be waived 26 virtual check-ins refer to brief patient-initiated communication with a practitioner via telephone video secure text messaging email shared images or use of patient portal patient consent is required for virtual check-ins lastly e-visits refer to non-face-to-face patient-initiated communication using an online patient portal codes are available for physicians and non-physicians to be billed for time spent over a seven-day period while both virtual check-ins and e-visits are intended to be patient-initiated practitioners can educate the patient on the service availability prior to patient agreement co-insurance and deductibles apply to both types of interactions reimbursement this article is protected by copyright all

incident to a recognized provider new patients can engage in telehealth visits without a prior established relationship with a medicarerecognized provider 26 nevertheless incident to billing roles for pharmacists stipulate that the patient must have an established relationship with the provider this language has not been changed in response to covid-19 telehealth changes 29 the cms requires documentation of duration of patient contact for time-based billing codes but has removed requirements to document history and physical exam 27 ambulatory care clinical pharmacists can also continue to utilize pre-covid-19 chronic care management codes offered by cms for non-face-to-face telephonic and care coordination efforts for medicare beneficiaries 30 existing reimbursement opportunities for non-face-to-face anticoagulation management are also available 31 of note the american society of health system pharmacists ashp continues to seek clarification from cms on additional billing stipulations specific to pharmacists therefore pharmacists should be mindful of additional guidance as it becomes released 32 while medicare billing codes are typically uniform across states pharmacists should review medicaid and commercial telehealth billing codes in their respective states 33 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved furthermore cms has waived penalties for hipaa violations to provide flexibility for the different modes of care described 35 technologies with audio and video capabilities are authorized for delivering medicare telehealth visits use of popular applications including facetime or skype is permitted without risk of hipaa violation penalties applications that are public facing such as facebook live or twitch should not be used in the provision of telehealth 35 pharmacists working remotely can consider using cellular devices linked to their clinic phone number call forwarding or apps that disguise the callers personal number and displays the clinic number instead ie doximityr 36 the telehealth billing mechanisms described can be utilized for cmm anticoagulation specific services and other non-face-to-face care efforts lastly while most telehealth encounters can be reimbursed pharmacists should be mindful that some brief communications may not necessarily be linked to reimbursement a comprehensive evaluation program is essential for the success and quality improvement of telehealth services 19 a systematic review found traditional pharmacist telehealth programs in ambulatory care had an overall positive impact on outcomes related to laboratory value monitoring and achieving therapeutic goals 16 for commonly managed disease states like hypertension diabetes hyperlipidemia and anticoagulation outcomes measured have included change in blood pressure a1c ldl inr and time in therapeutic range other outcomes such as hospitalizations or emergency department visits readmissions and mortality have also been measured by programs patient selfreported questionnaire scores find positive patient satisfaction with pharmacist telehealthcare 37 ambulatory care clinical pharmacists providing telehealth during covid-19 similarly should track both clinical and non-clinical outcomes such as number of patient outreach encounters and billing codes submitted documentation and evaluation of such outcomes should be determined on a practicespecific basis but nevertheless should be pre-planned both clinical and financial outcomes tracked this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved accepted article during the provision of telehealth during covid-19 can also help to provide justification for ongoing program maintenance beyond this public emergency patient care opportunities for pharmacists may expand far beyond traditional roles when in a crisis such as the covid-19 pandemic for example ambulatory care clinical pharmacists could play a larger role managing chronic conditions or providing point-of-care testing for infectious diseases to reduce the burden on other healthcare providers 38 to encourage this expansion during the covid-19 outbreak national pharmacy organizations joined to create policy recommendations which urged policymakers and national institutions to recognize and authorize the expanded role of pharmacists to support the covid-19 response 39 several governors enacted executive orders which enhanced operational capacity flexibility and efficiency of pharmacies and permitted licensed pharmacists to provide direct patient care without direct supervision by a physician 40 41 additional guidance from the department of health and human services encouraged pharmacists to aid in covid-19 testing 42 these declarations reduced regulatory barriers allowing pharmacists to use clinical judgement without physician directives examples of pharmacist role expansion were abundant among the aforementioned ambulatory care clinical pharmacist workgroup an ambulatory care clinical pharmacist practicing in an outpatient pulmonary clinic managed all incoming medication requests and triagedtreated patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms to prevent acute care utilization while physicians were redeployed to intensive care units additionally a psychiatric ambulatory care clinical pharmacist using updated clozapine covid-19 guidelines and updated fda recommendations was able to make clinical decisions about whether it was appropriate for delayed absolute neutrophil count laboratory monitoring for clozapine risk evaluation and mitigation strategy 43 if the decision was made by the pharmacist to delay this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved accepted article laboratory monitoring due to covid-19 concerns the associated risks were also communicated to the patient by the pharmacist via a telephonic visit the pharmacist also ensured access to the medication other role expansions include authorizing refills for medications substituting therapeutically equivalent medications and administering necessary vaccinesmedications without a physicians order changes to clinical practice during the covid-19 pandemic have required adjustments in the experiential training of healthcare students early in the pandemic the american association for medical colleges aamc swiftly called for a pause to all medical student clinical rotations and later supported their voluntary participation in direct patient care experiences 44 while the aamc provided specific guidance for medical students to date there have been no public statements from the american association of colleges of pharmacy or the accreditation council for pharmacy education providing guidance for the experiential training of pharmacy students or adjustments to graduation requirements as such pharmacy schools and health-systems were required to strike a balance between providing adequate learning experiences while ensuring the safety of the students staff patients and community state pharmacy organizations such as the michigan pharmacists association mpa advocated for the expanded role of student pharmacists in clinical practice to ease the care burden 45 students were enabled to support pharmacists efforts by administering covid-19 testing or dispensing medications without direct oversight 45 additionally some pharmacy schools elected to graduate students early to assist with the pandemic efforts 4647 one effective approach to modifying inpatient appe rotations was described in the literature pharmacist preceptors assessed students virtually as they conducted modified rotational activities such as presenting on de-identified patients answering drug information questions and drafting therapeutic protocols 48 there is a paucity of published literature providing guidance for the training of students in the ambulatory care practice during a pandemic since the pandemic is expected to continue well into the early summer with a potential for resurgence a cohesive approach to delivering appe was necessary for present and future planning in response the previously mentioned ambulatory care workgroup convened to address challenges being faced including how to provide effective orientation shadowing and training assessment and feedback the covid-19 pandemic presented many challenges to delivering experiential appe in ambulatory clinics the strategies developed in a covid hotspot may serve as a framework for other pharmacy schools and health-systems around the country our workgroup devised a structured plan to help adapt ambulatory care appe rotations during the covid-19 pandemic figure 2  the plan focused on how to remotely orient students to complete tasks and demonstrate competence in the learning objectives of the experience the workgroup also identified opportunities to modify traditional experiential activities using remote virtual platforms to host video meetings share clinical files and conduct experiential activities consideration was given to determining which virtual meeting platforms would comply with the health insurance portability and accountability act 35 additionally the workgroup modified data collection patient communication and documentation templates to support clinical activities of the students there was also a consensus that once shadowing and training components were satisfied preceptors may supervise student-patient communication using methods such as three-way calling and virtual audiovideo visits following the first trial of remote appe the workgroup modified the systematic approach to include acceptable clinical activities for students some of these activities include but are not limited to conducting patient interviews obtaining medication histories completing prior authorizations ensuring patient access to medications assisting with refill requests developing clinical protocols providing remote in-services to the care team participating in multi-disciplinary patient discussions answering drug information questions and collecting clinical outcome data this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the coronavirus pandemic has abruptly changed almost every aspect of healthcare in outpatient clinics operations have slowed or even suspended scheduling of face-to-face visits telehealth and limited contact forms of patient care have become key modes of ambulatory care delivery at the same time many outpatient healthcare workers have been redeployed to other areas of demand thus ambulatory care clinical pharmacists are practicing at the top of their licenses filling gaps as healthcare provider colleagues are redeployed due to the pandemic especially by managing medication therapy for chronic conditions economic regulatory and logistical barriers for pharmacists to assume provider roles have shifted or even evaporated for the time being 2641 ambulatory care clinical pharmacists have been ready agile and able to develop best practices to meet the rapidly evolving need for increased provider access while being flexible and strategic during the covid-19 crisis pharmacists healthcare organizations and regulators should be forward thinking after the crisis is over healthcare will most likely look different social distancing is expected to linger beyond the re-opening of businesses and outpatient care pharmacists can be providers and leaders in covid-19 testing that will likely become a key component in re-opening the country to return to work telehealth is likely to become a prevailing form of healthcare delivery it will be important for pharmacists to sustain heightened levels of patientcentered care in various modes of delivery including telehealth furthermore provision of telehealth by pharmacists can increase access to and quality of care which is prudent as health care continues to transition from traditional payment models to value-based care 49 advocacy for maintaining expanded scopes of pharmacy practice will be important in removing barriers that hinder the optimization of medication therapy through pharmacists care patients access to pharmacists care must be sustainable as well medicare medicaid and commercial payors should institute systems to ensure access to pharmacist services specifically a joint group of pharmacy organizations recommended immediate legislative action to include the pharmacy and medically underserved areas enhancement act 39 50 this this article is protected by copyright all rights

provision such as the management of stroke activations considerations for intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular clot retrieval1 2 3 whilst some reports have commented on considerations along the spectrum of stroke care4

5 there has been little guidance beyond hyperacute stroke treatment care in asu is proven to reduce mortality and disability with long lasting benefits up to 10 years after stroke onset6 during this pandemic asu care is likely to be affected in many hospitals many may have their physical stroke units displaced due to bed utilization needs for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 infected and suspect cases most hospitals have staff deployed outside their usual workplaces to cover emergency isolation and screening services therefore disbanding the acute stroke unit team of multi-professional healthcare providers in our hospital we estimate that 20-25 of our doctors nurses and therapists from the stroke ward have been deployed to other areas staff shortages are often compounded by quarantine of staff due to covid-19 patient exposure or acute respiratory illnesses thus patients may be scattered across various wards in the hospital are being managed by healthcare providers who are unfamiliar with stroke care and are not trained to use established stroke pathways and protocols furthermore stroke patients who have concomitant acute respiratory symptoms or contact history will need to be isolated and therefore cared in areas other than the asu at the singapore general hospital our asu has remained physically intact but many asu staff have been deployed elsewhere asu due to the covid-19 crisis the stroke team attending to patients at the emergency department don full personal protection equipment as patients covid-19 risk status is unknown once this has been determined the patient may be admitted to isolation wards based on specific criteria we have encountered stroke patients being managed in isolation wards due to suspected possible covid-19 infection including some who had been treated with intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular clot retrieval in order to orientate staff in these circumstances our stroke team had to brief healthcare workers in these isolation wards on the care of these stroke patients which was difficult as many had no neurology training and usually practice in other specialty areas we realized that our asu pathway was developed to be used by healthcare workers trained to use it familiar with its format and was too complex to be used by untrained staff an interprofessional team with medical nursing and allied health backgrounds at the singapore general hospital developed an adapted asu protocol that was easy to use and ensured that the key elements the acute stroke unit are maintained this protocol focuses on the asu phase of stroke care with some rehabilitation aspects which occurs just before or after the asu phase this tool may be useful to others facing similar issues in hospitals across the world there are 4 elements included in this section neurological observations blood pressure measurement input-output charting investigations and specific issues following hyperacute reperfusion treatments neurological observation for stroke deficits usually involves the national institute health stroke scale nihss which requires specific training and certification instead we use monitoring with the glasgow coma scale gcs pupillary size and reaction and nihss component 1 10 5 and 6 level of consciousness dysarthria motor arm and motor leg figure 2
 this monitoring can be performed without any formal training as gcs is part of standard nursing training and the others are easily communicated with written documents whilst this is not as comprehensive as the nihss it is a reasonable alternative for untrained staff and covers key components use of gcs is limited for assessing neurological deterioration in stroke7 the frequency of observations should be specified and the nursing team should receive advice on when to activate the medical team of any differences in neurological status blood pressure is particularly important in acute stroke patients and this is emphasized as a separate component the frequency of measurements should be specified and targets above and below that require escalation should also be specified daily input and output charting is important as patients may require intravenous fluids and their daily intake may be affected by the stroke bowel movements should be noted to avoid constipation investigations should be ordered mindfully to avoid unnecessary transfers and use of resources if there is no urgent need nor significant impact on patient care the managing team may choose to defer some investigations if there are pressures on hospital resources for example work-up to search for a possible patent foramen ovale may be deferred if the suspicion for this is low in a patient with cryptogenic stroke there may be specific instructions for patients following thrombolysis and endovascular clot retrieval and these should be advised for individual needs accordingly there are 5 stroke complications emphasize in the adapted asu protocol which should be screened for prevented as well as detected and managed early should they occur these are venous thromboembolism vte dysphagia complications including aspiration pneumonia complications from tubes and lines immobility complications and issues with nutrition vte prophylaxis for stroke patients should be maintained for patients cared outside the asu if the staff is not familiar with the indications intermittent pneumatic compressions devices should be applied universally unless contraindicated prevention of aspiration pneumonia is important may not be a particular issue outside the asu and thus is important to highlight as the medical and nursing staff may not be trained to assess swallowing all patients should have a speech therapy assessment for dysphagia screening if possible prior to this patients should be kept nil by mouth or fed through a nasogastric tube other measures are to ensure that the appropriate diet consistency advised by the speech therapist is adhered to elevate the patients head of bed to minimum 30-45 degree if it not contraindicated during and at least 30 minutes after feeding stop feeds or diet if the patient is drowsy and to not let the patient swallow food or drink if the patients is drooling coughing choking has frequent throat clearing is breathless after swallowing or has a wet or gurgling voice unnecessary tubes should not be inserted and should be removed as soon as not needed including urinary catheters intravenous cannula and nasogastric tubes intravenous cannula insertion sites should be checked for signs of phlebitis every nursing shift patients with stroke often have immobility and hence regular monitoring for pressure issues is needed prevention of immobility complications is important and involves regular turning protection of the hemiplegic shoulder with appropriate positioning pressure area protection and out-of-bed mobilization nutritional needs must be considered as swallowing may be affected this is especially pertinent for patients on tube feeding this section deals with components of asu care which are often inter-professional we have included daily check-ins with the stroke team patient education communication with families discharge planning and support after discharge we have adopted daily telephone check-ins by the stroke team contacting the clinical team managing the stroke patient in isolation facilities to discuss daily updates and management plans the check-ins are initiated by the medical doctor of the stroke team mostly via telephone however specific nursing and therapy issues are then conveyed and addressed by the appropriate professionals in the stroke team with their colleagues in the isolation wards this ensures that staff in the non-asu wards feel supported and can have their queries clarified patient education is particularly important as the usual systems of care are disturbed by the covid-19 crisis this issue is compounded by non-asu staff not being familiar with stroke education thus we propose that patients are referred to reliable resources and website and given vetted hard copy reading material smoking cessation advice must not be neglected videos are used to assist with caregiving training as this may be limited due to physical distancing policies most hospitals have a limited or no-visitor policy for acute stroke patients with physical communication andor cognitive impairment the lack of visits by family and loved ones can result in depression anxiety and feelings of abandonment there is a system for patients to speak to and interact with families with facilitated teleconferencing in addition regular updates by the healthcare team to patients loved ones are provided discharge planning is different with the covid-19 crisis as many post-discharge services are not available due to lockdown or physical distancing restrictions we attempt to attend to most issues as far as possible as an inpatient to avoid unnecessary outpatient visits the stroke team physiotherapist checks in with patients by telephone 2 weeks after discharge to assess coping at home and post stroke complications and any particular issue is brought up to the appropriate stroke team professionals to address a hospital contact number is provided so that stroke survivors can seek help if needed appropriate rehabilitation needs are addressed for discharge whilst usual rehabilitation services prior to the covid-19 pandemic may be curtailed due to lockdown infection control and other reasons other options such as tele-rehabilitation home exercise program guidance with videos may be considered international stroke organizations have collated resources for use by stroke clinicians to facilitate the change of practice in treatment delivery8 9 10 as care may be truncated due to the covid-19 situation we advocate for outpatient follow-up for all patient at a multidisciplinary post-stroke clinic to ensure all loose ends are addressed these clinics are currently face-to-face but we will soon be initiating a virtual post-stroke clinic for patients who will likely not require a physical examination such as those with no or minor residual deficits stroke support organizations sso are not able to provide their usual host of services we are encouraged by our local sso who has developed online befriending support groups and other programs patients should be referred to adapted care and support services for stroke survivors and their caregivers the adapted asu pathway is a guide which has assisted care of stroke patients outside our usual asu physical ward and pathway and by staff not familiar with stroke patient management it was designed to be simple require little training and cover key elements of asu care and can be adopted by other hospitals and centers facing challenges of maintaining asu care during the covid-19 crisis none none  safety of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis pascal demoly   the treatment goals for acute rs are to eliminate infection when present improve ostiomeatal patency as a means of restoring ventilation promote drainage reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms including pain and nasal congestion 17 19 intranasal corticosteroids inss with their recognized anti-inflammatory properties have been shown to be effective in reducing mucosal swelling and improving sinus drainage thereby hastening the elimination of pathogens 5 19 consequently the joint task force on practice parameters for allergy and immunology recommends combining an ins with an antibiotic mainly amoxicillinpotassium clavulanate for the symptomatic treatment of recurrent acute or chronic rs the joint task force also notes that ins monotherapy may be helpful in patients with acute and chronic rs 5 similarly the european academy of allergology and clinical immunology recommends ins therapy either alone or as an adjunct to an antibiotic for the treatment of moderate and severe rs 8 the anti-inflammatory effects of inss include decreased vascular permeability as well as inhibition of the release andor formation of mucous secretogogues eg histamine leukotrienes prostanoids platelet-activating factor 5 20 those effects are thought to result from inhibition of the release of proinflammatory mediators such as adhesion molecules cytokines mast cells basophils and eosinophils 21 by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytoplasm the glucocorticoid molecule of an ins produces a complex that acts on a variety of transcriptional activities leading to reductions in levels of proinflammatory molecules and cells table 2
 21 22 23 24 in acute rs inss have been shown to reduce the inflammation associated with symptoms such as congestion headache and facial pain 21 25 concerns about the safety of corticosteroids in acute rs are related to the systemic absorption of oral corticosteroids which may affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hpa axis function bone metabolism and ocular pressure 17 26 27 28 these effects may result in adverse events aes such as growth inhibition in children 29 30 bone mineral density loss 31 32 33 34 hip fracture 35 cataracts 36 ocular hypertension or glaucoma 37 hypertension hyperglycemia 38 and easily bruised skin 31 39 given current recommendations for the use of inss in acute rs and concerns about the safety of corticosteroids in general this article will review data from clinical trials to help clarify the safety issues pertaining to the use of the ins drugs for acute rs as well as the differences in systemic absorption between the older and newer inss the motivation for the development of all the intranasal formulations of the corticosteroidsincluding the older inss beclomethasone dipropionate bdp flunisolide flu budesonide bud and triamcinolone acetonide taa and the more recently developed fluticasone propionate fp mometasone furoate mf fluticasone furoate and ciclesonidewas to minimize the risk of systemic absorption and the resulting aes fig 1
 the intranasal route of administration delivers drug directly to the target organ allowing local therapeutic concentrations because of the high affinity of the agents for the glucocorticoid receptor approximately 30 of the administered dose is deposited in the nose where it binds with the glucocorticoid receptor while the remaining 70 is swallowed the swallowed drug is subject to hepatic first-pass metabolism which is about 90 with bud and taa 2 agents with relatively lower lipophilicity or lipid-partitioning potential and 99 with mf and fp which have higher lipophilicity 40 the rank order of some of the currently available inss according to lipophilicity highest to lowest is mf fp bdp bud taa and flu 41 42 concern about the risk of systemic side effects with inss arises from the possibility that a portion of the drug may reach the systemic circulation through the airway and the gastrointestinal gi tract 43 the main determinant of systemic bioavailability of these drugs is the amount directly absorbed from the lung or nose which does not undergo first-pass hepatic inactivation as does most of the swallowed portion of the dose 40 as shown in table 3
 the estimated absolute bioavailability of an intranasal dose is highest with compounds with greater water solubility eg bud and flu with 34 and 49 absolute bioavailability respectively 43 45 46 and lowest with the less water-soluble more lipophilic agents eg fp with 1 and mf with 01 absolute bioavailability 43 45 47 48 in a randomized single-blind placebo-controlled 3-way cross-over study in 15 healthy subjects mf and fp both administered at the higher than indicated doses of 400 gd for 4 days produced mean peak plasma concentrations that were slightly above the assays lower limit of detection 49 investigators used a variety of markers or surrogates to determine the systemic presence of glucocorticoids in the circulation an excessive level of systemic glucocorticoids would reduce the endogenous production of cortisol which can be detected by evaluating basal hpa activity measurements of hpa function such as area-under-the-curve cortisol concentrations and urinary free cortisol excretion are considered the most sensitive indicators of ins systemic bioavailability stimulation tests of hpa-axis function such as tests that measure serum cortisol levels after the administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone acth or cosyntropin are not as sensitive in identifying the systemic bioavailability of the inss but they predict the likelihood of aes more accurately 43 50 51 corticosteroids also may inhibit linear bone growth 52 an effect that has been assessed in short-term studies using knemometry a precise measurement of lower-leg growth 50 53 54 and surrogate markers of bone formation eg osteocalcin 43 as well as in long-term studies using whole-body stadiometry 43 50 51 a relatively small amount of published data for only a few agents is available on the systemic safety of inss in patients with rs giger et al 61 in a randomized double-blind parallel-group trial involving 112 patients with nonallergic chronic rs did not detect any signs of adrenal suppression or significant changes in morning serum cortisol values with once- or twice-daily intranasal bdp 400 gd administered for 12 weeks a 3-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial with mf 200 g or 400 g bid in 967 patients aged 878 years with acute rs did not find any clinically relevant decreases in plasma cortisol levels based on 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation tests 62 studies in patients with ar also have demonstrated little evidence of systemic effects with most inss table 4
 in one of the earliest such studies an open longitudinal multicenter trial involving 25 patients with par followed for up to 55 years treatment with intranasal bud 400 gd did not affect hpa-axis activity based on response to acth challenge the investigators noted that plasma cortisol values were well within normal ranges and increases in plasma cortisol levels after acth stimulation were high and remained unchanged regardless of duration of treatment 64 similarly no significant differences were seen between 2 dosages of bdp nasal spray 336 g qd and 168 g bid and placebo in plasma cortisol response to cosyntropin stimulation in a randomized placebo- and positive-controlled third partyblind parallel-group multiple-dose study of 64 adult men with ar who were treated for 36 days in contrast a significant p  01 difference between patients receiving prednisone or placebo was seen in the plasma cortisol response to cosyntropin stimulation 65 vargas et al 66 reported similar results from a 4-week randomized double-blind double-dummy placebo-controlled study n  105 in which the hpa-axis response to a 6-hour cosyntropin test was not altered with intranasal fp 200 g qd or fp 400 g bid compared with placebo or oral prednisone prednisone 75 or 15 mgd was associated with a significant decline in hpa-axis function compared with placebo as indicated by lower plasma cortisol levels area under the curve and peak concentrations after cosyntropin stimulation and reduced mean 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion 66 the investigators concluded that fp whether administered at the recommended dose of 200 g qd or at 4 times that dose does not alter hpa-axis response to the 6-hour cosyntropin test studies in children with ar have generally been consistent with adult studies in terms of demonstrating a lack of hpa-axis suppression with inss a 2-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group multicenter study in children n  250 aged 411 years with seasonal ar did not identify any significant differences between fp 100 and 200 g qd and placebo in morning plasma cortisol concentrations in all subject groups before and after treatment 67 similarly no significant effects on adrenocortical function at 30 or 60 minutes after cosyntropin stimulation with either of 2 doses of intranasal taa 220 and 440 g qd were seen in a 6-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group multicenter study of children n80 aged 612 years with ar 68 another 6-week study with a similar design in 78 children aged 25 years demonstrated no hpa-axis suppression with bud 64 g qd based on plasma cortisol levels at 0 30 and 60 minutes after cosyntropin stimulation 26 brannan et al 69 have reported no clinically relevant systemic exposure to mf in children as young as 3 years of age in the first phase of a randomized placebo-controlled parallel-group multiple-dose study 48 children aged 612 years received mfns 50 100 or 200 g qd or placebo for 7 days 69 at the end of treatment mean plasma cortisol concentrations were not significantly different from baseline values nor were mean plasma cortisol and 24-hour urinary free cortisol values with mf significantly different from placebo a second phase of the study was conducted in 48 children aged 35 years who received the same doses of mf or placebo for 14 days hpa-axis function was assessed by response to a 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation test administered 2 to 3 hours after the last dose on the final day of treatment all of the children experienced a normal plasma cortisol response to the cosyntropin challenge and mean increases in plasma cortisol after cosyntropin stimulation were not significantly different between mf and placebo 69 the inss also have been evaluated for risk of growth suppression using stadiometry and knemometry occasionally with results different from that seen in tests of hpa-axis suppression for example no hpa-axis suppression with bdp 168 g bid as measured by a 60-minute cosyntropin stimulation test was reported in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group multicenter study in 100 children with ar 51 however stadiometry testing of these same children found a significantly slower rate of growth the difference in growth rate was apparent as early as 1 month after the start of treatment and remained statistically significant over the last 6 months of the 1-year study stadiometry studies of fp and mf did not uncover any evidence of growth suppression continuous treatment for 1 year with the maximum recommended dose of intranasal fp 200 g qd was found not to affect mean standing height as measured by stadiometry in 150 children aged 359 years with par 70 in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study fp was equivalent to placebo in effects on growth velocity a 1-year randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study found no growth retardation as measured by stadiometry in 98 children aged 39 years with par randomized to receive either mf 100 g qd or placebo 50 at all time points the mean height of mf-treated patients was similar to that of the placebo group although a significantly greater change in height from baseline was seen in the mf group at weeks 8 and 52 the rate of growth over 12 months was similar in both groups in a subgroup of 38 subjects enrolled in the cosyntropin arm of the study subjects receiving mf did not exhibit any evidence of hpa-axis suppression in a 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation test a 1993 parallel-group study found evidence of suppressed short-term lower-leg growth as measured by knemometry with bud 200 g bid or intramuscular methylprednisolone acetate 60 mg qd when compared to terfenadine tablets 60 mg qd in 44 children aged 615 years with ar both of the corticosteroids administered for 6 weeks were associated with a significant reduction in lower-leg growth compared with terfenadine p  001 and with values observed during a 4-week run-in period p  01 53 those findings contrast with a knemometry study conducted with mf in 22 children aged 712 years with ar in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 4-way crossover study no significant differences were observed in lower-leg growth rates in children treated for 2 weeks with once-daily mf 100 g or 200 g bud 400 g or placebo 71 pairwise comparisons showed that patients receiving a 100-g qd dose of mf experienced greater growth than those receiving bud p  033 or placebo p  024 investigators did not detect any statistically significant sequence carryover overall treatment or period effects on lower-leg growth rates

summarizes local aes observed in clinical trials of patients with acute and chronic rs in general the incidence of treatment-related local aes with inss was comparable to that found with placebo and most events were mild or moderate in severity the most commonly reported local aes were headache epistaxis and gi complaints the first double-blind randomized trial of an ins as adjunctive therapy for acute or chronic rs was a parallel-group multicenter study n  180 with flu 300 g tid or placebo as an adjunct to amoxicillinclavulanate potassium acp for 3 weeks phase 1 followed by monotherapy with either flu or placebo for an additional 4 weeks phase 2 74 approximately two thirds of patients in phase 1 and half of those in phase 2 complained of at least one ae most complaints were attributed to the rs itself to ineffective therapy or to gi side effects of the antibiotic during phase 2 headache was the most frequently reported side effect with flu the incidence of aes was similar in the active treatment and placebo groups since that initial study clinical trials have been conducted with 4 other inssmf 200 or 400 g bid fp 200 g qd bdp 400 g qd and bud 50 g qd and 200 g qd in separate studiesas adjunctive therapy with an antibiotic for acute rs 25 62 75 76 similar aes were seen in 2 studies with mf as adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics in two 3-week double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter studies in which mf 200 or 400 g twice daily was given with acp in patients n  407 and n  967 with acute or acute recurrent rs the most commonly reported aes were headache epistaxis nasal burningirritation and pharyngitis most aes were mild or moderate in severity and their incidence was similar in the mf and placebo groups 62 77 in 2 separate studies of bud as an adjunct to oral antibiotics in children with acute rs no aes associated with the ins were reported 75 76 only one study reported a greater incidence of aes with ins-antibiotic adjunctive therapy than with placebo although not all of the aes may have been due to ins therapy in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial n  95 a greater number of local aes eg headache epistaxis vaginal itchingyeast infection and nausea or stomach irritation were observed in patients receiving a 21-day course of fp 200 gd as an adjunct to the cephalosporin antibiotic cefuroxime axetil and the topical decongestant xylometazoline hydrochloride than in those receiving placebo however investigators noted that the aes observed with fp may have been a result of the combination of medications or one of the other medications 25 to date mf is the only ins to have been investigated in a large-scale clinical trial as monotherapy for acute rs the randomized double-blind double-dummy dose-ranging study n  981 compared mf 200 g qd and bid for 15 days both with placebo and with amoxicillin 500 mg tid 7 investigators observed a similar incidence of mild or moderate local aes in all treatment groups and with placebo the most common treatment-related events were headache and epistaxis studies in patients with chronic rs have yielded similar information on the local effects of inss only minor differences in ae profiles were observed between patients treated with bud 128 gd and placebo in a randomized double-blind multicenter trial n  244 aged 1965 years most aes eg respiratory infection headache blood-tinged secretions were reported as mild or moderate although respiratory infection was the most commonly reported ae there was no statistically significant difference between groups in the incidence of this ae 78 in a randomized double-blind parallel-group comparison of once- or twice-daily bdp 400 gd in 112 patients aged 1966 years with nonallergic chronic rs giger et al observed a similar number of local aes eg epistaxis dryness of nasal mucosa nasal burningitching in the once- and twice-daily groups slight differences were seen between groups in terms of the severity of aes once-daily mild 616 moderate 346 severe 38 twice-daily mild 531 moderate 438 severe 31 61 the safety profiles of the inss in the treatment of acute rs have been well established reported aes have been primarily local eg epistaxis and headache generally classified as mild to moderate and similar in incidence to that of placebo based on the results of clinical studies concerns about possible systemic effects with intranasal use have not been justified studies that tested for inss in the systemic circulation and possible effects arising from such exposure showed no evidence of hpa-axis suppression with administration of mf fp and bud at doses as high as 400 g twice daily for 4 weeks studies after administration of similar doses of mf bud and fp to children for as long as 1 year showed no evidence of growth retardation no clinically relevant systemic exposure resulting from intranasal administration of these agents was observed for patients receiving an ins at the recommended dose there appears to be little risk of hpa-axis suppression or disturbed bone metabolism the mild side effect profile for newer agents such as mf which is the only ins that has been studied as adjunctive therapy to antibiotics and as monotherapy for acute rs appears to be related to their relatively low systemic bioavailability thus physicians should feel confident in prescribing newer agents for long-term treatment of acute rs  death certification in covid-19 cases in spain mpl sanz s herranz c y floristn f mis lozano mcm iribas   31008 pamplona la certificacin de la defuncin es un acto mdico en el que el profesional debe poner el mismo esfuerzo y dedicacin que en el resto de los informes elaborados en vida del paciente para su correcta cumplimentacin el facultativo debe seguir las instrucciones bsicas poniendo especial cuidado en rellenar adecuadamente la secuencia de causas de muerte en casos de pandemia la cumplimentacin del certificado de defuncin corresponde a la medicina asistencial y para poder hacerlo los organismos oficiales deben publicar instrucciones basadas en recomendaciones internacionales debe establecerse cuanto antes la posibilidad de comunicacin telemtica de las defunciones mientras eso no sea posible tienen que establecerse procedimientos que permitan en situacin de pandemia comunicar de forma inmediata la mortalidad a las autoridades sanitarias abstract death certification requires the same effort and dedication as all reports by doctors during their patients lifetimes the physician must follow the basic instructions to complete a death certificate correctly taking special care to fill in the sequence of causes of death in the case of a pandemic completion of the death certificate falls to the primary care physician and therefore the official bodies must publish instructions based on international recommendations it should be established as soon as possible whether it is possible to report deaths telematically while this is not possible in a pandemic procedures should be put in place to enable the immediate reporting of deaths to the health authorities palabras clave introduction to the medical death certificate medical-legal aspects documented knowledge of a cultures own social history and that of the individuals within it is a characteristic of developed societies one of the factors that influence this social knowledge is the existence of records birth and death registries are useful means for learning our social history in spain we find documents of records of this type dating from the 16 th century kept in parish churches together with baptism certificates after some time inscription also took place outside churches the first place to keep registries of death in the courts of justice was the state of massachusetts 1639 1 the medical certification of death first appeared in the last third of the 19 th century and occurred due to several reasons on the one hand the increased closeness of doctors attending to the dying in cities was a factor together with the scientific basis public hygiene which was largely based on the development of medical statistics and public preventive measures this also gave rise to new laws and civil codes and it was the origin of civil registries moreover the inclusion of medical statistics led to the internationalisation of disease prevention at the end of the 19 th century almost all european countries had centralised death registration systems in 1871 after several attempts the registry office ro commenced work in spain 2 this advance had been preceded by a transition period during which a partial provincial registry office started work for large and medium-sized towns in 1841 the law made it necessary for all municipalities to create a ro in which data on the civil status of all spanish citizens had to be recorded births marriages and deaths etc independently of their beliefs a century later in 1957 the need to update and renovate the law currently in force was detected adapting it to the needs of the time this led to the law of 8 june 1957 on ro 3 finally in 2011 a new ro law was passed 4 to make it suitable for the values enshrined in the 1978 constitution as well as the current reality of spanish society although it had been planned to come into force on 30 june 2020 judicial and organisational measures against covid-19 have delayed its coming into force once again this time until 30 april 2021 5 parallel to the ro the medical death certificate mdc has also evolved currently in spain the model published in january 2009 is in force this was prepared by the general board of official doctors associations cgcom and the national institute of statistics ine the change involved the inclusion in a single document of the mdc and the statistical data of the state deaths bulletin statistical mortality bulletin bed the mdc-bed is a document composed of a printed a3 sheet folded in half as arimany manso et al explain 6 if we consider this document to be composed of 2 sheets the first corresponds to the organisation of associated doctors organizacin mdica colegial omc and it shows the medical data supplied by the certifying doctor who has to fill it out the second sheet is usually filled in by the undertakers with the data supplied by family members of the patient who died and these data consist of the civil aspects of the subject it is available in paper format from the provincial official doctors associations colegios oficiales de mdicos com the current mdc-bed has a more medical approach to comply with the norms of the world health organisation who 6  according to the regulation that expresses the ro law the mdc-bed must be filled in by the doctor who attended the dead individual during their final disease or anybody else who recognises the corpse 7 the medical ethics code ec 8 regulates the obligation to certify a death stating that although the doctor who has attended the patient the most is the one with the greatest ethical responsibility to fill out all of the sections of the death certificate it is not ethically acceptable to reject the obligation to certify this when one has been present at the death knows the patient or has access to the clinical history on the back of the first mdc-bed document we find certain basic instructions for certification fig 1  established by the who to be followed when filling in the certificate in the case of violent deaths or the suspicion of criminality the mdc-bed should not be signed and these deaths should be referred to judicial investigation 9 the general procedure for the management and notification of deaths is shown in figure 2  the mdc-bed is a medical-legal document in which a doctor should employ the same effort and dedication as in the other reports drawn up during the lifetime of the patient clinically and ethically it is possible to sign a certificate using presumptive criteria if the outcome is possible and the information about the circumstances of death and the patients history of pathology nevertheless it is not acceptable to sign it if shielding oneself in a possible offense of falsity contained in the penal code our experience and that of other authors confirms that it is unlikely that a doctor who in good faith and after examining a patient would be prosecuted after certifying a death as natural when it was not 10 it being an ethical duty to fill out the mdc-bed in this situation the priority is to reduce the suffering of family members over and above unreasonable legal doubts humanising treatment under circumstances of such intense emotional suffering 11 this field to refer to clinical antecedents and not as should be understood noting in the so-called antecedent causes the process that due to the initial cause brought about the immediate cause of death recently these have been modified by including a qr code and recording the 9-figure membership number in independent boxes to be appropriately filled out correctly filling out the mdc-bed has important consequences in terms of medical policy based on them the ine extracts the causes of death from these documents to generate official mortality statistics according to the results obtained measures for prevention are applied and the necessary resources are used to meet existing needs by implementing medical policies not filling out the causes of death correctly fig 3  may be highly important in epidemiological terms 13 the result of this would be a poor organisation of the resources destined for health purposes in terms of research into diseases as well as the implementation of preventive policies there is little experience in our field in connection with the certification of deaths during epidemics it is understood that in case of multiple deaths procedures for action may be similar to those used in catastrophes as barbera and xifr 14 state catastrophes are a public health problem because they are likely to increase morbimortality and reduce quality of life epidemics clearly fulfil these criteria the role of certification of the causes of death in major catastrophes corresponds to forensic medicine 15 while certification in epidemics corresponds to healthcare providers 16 however the comparison may be useful in establishing procedures for the management of corpses and certification of death in case of multiple deaths during epidemics 17 the sole example we have in spain of an epidemic with multiple deaths and registration of the same is the influenza pandemic of 1918 this outbreak led to many scientific studies statistical analyses and strong reaction by the press after may 1918 it was a terrible experience for society and gave rise to multiple ways of fighting it by governments as well as an extraordinary response by healthcare professionals and the population in general studies of the influenza pandemic in 1918 have covered not only morbimortality data analysis these data being intrinsically highly important but have also led to an understanding of the epidemic that goes beyond statistics to be able to evaluate the repercussions of the influenza epidemic on mortality we have the information contained in the movimientos naturales de poblacin prepared by the ine and the monthly medical demography bulletins published by the ministerio de la gobernacin nevertheless these data are not enough to allow us to go into detail for example they do not permit examination of data associated with city quarters porras-gallo 18 studied the demographic statistics drawn up annually by madrid town hall statistics department as well as the yearly summaries of the said demographic statistics crossing these data with those of the ro records and books of registered deaths corresponding to the years 1918 and 1919 made it possible to determine the evolution of morbimortality in detail during the pandemic in spain 19 nevertheless in the past and like today mortality statistics change depending on the criteria which are applied to them thus for example in the case of madrid the gross rates of general mortality and the specific rates in 1918 and 1919 obtained from ro data and general annual summaries of the demographic statistics of madrid town hall were very different this was because deaths were registered in the district corresponding to the place of death while the town hall prepared its statistics on the basis of cemetery data where deaths were recorded in the district where the individuals had lived rather than the one where they had died this is an example of the complexity of studies of historical morbimortality 18 20 national and international recommendations for the medical certification of deaths in connection with covid-19 on 29 march 2020 the cgcom issued a communication in which according to the definitions proposed by the who the national committee of public administrations reported on the procedure to be followed in certifying deaths during the current covid-19 epidemic 16 this document states that deaths caused in an epidemic are natural deaths there is no need to inform the medical-legal or judicial fields of deaths the judicial intervention of the forensic doctor will be restricted to cases of violent death or those in which there is a clear suspicion of criminality in these cases in which investigating the death corresponds to the medical-legal field the fact of having a positive pcr sars-cov-2 indicates a datum that is of epidemiological interest one that should perhaps be taken into account as an aggravating factor if the death occurred at another time from the traumatic event however it corresponds to forensic professionals to analyse this possible contributory cause in all other cases certification of death corresponds to healthcare doctors regardless of whether they work in the public or private domain as is the case in other neighbouring countries 21 22 we said beforehand that when somebody dies reducing the suffering of family members should take priority over any unreasonable legal doubts when certifying the death humanising how they are treated in circumstances of such intense emotional suffering 11 in circumstances such as those experienced during this pandemic this principle is more necessary than ever the cgcom document establishes 2 scenarios when certifying deaths due to covid-19 the first refers to cases where although there is no analytical confirmation the symptoms are compatible with the disease in these circumstances it is recommendable to certify the fundamental cause of death as unconfirmed or suspected covid-19 coronavirus infection as the immediate cause the proposal is to use multiple organ failure respiratory distress or acute respiratory failure intermediate causes may also be cited if there are any or if any are known such as pneumonia sepsis or coagulation pathology the second scenario is that where covid-19 have been confirmed by a laboratory test in such cases the fundamental cause of death should be confirmed covid-19 an important question for all of the above scenarios is how to register comorbidity of patients who died due to covid-19 23 24 the omc document states that any existing diseases or comorbidities involving a greater risk of developing a serious disease should be recorded in the section referring to other processes cardiovascular diseases arterial hypertension or diabetes the question sometimes arises of whether to record death due to covid-19 or death with covid-19 and it may be hard to determine whether covid-19 caused the death or whether it was a pre-existing disease this has to be decided by the doctor who signs the certificate in the light of the data on the clinical evolution of the patient which may require an in-depth study of their medical history in any case the content of the mdc-bed is evaluated later on by the professionals working in the mortality registries this enables modifications to the fundamental cause of death after study of the clinical history and communicating if applicable with the professional who had certified the death at the time the cgcom document is based on the who international guide for the certification of covid-19 this was subsequently modified in a publication dated 16 april 2020 which contained examples for the certification of deaths not caused by to codify deaths the who establishes code u071 for deaths caused by covid-19 and confirmed by analytical study and code u072 for deaths without confirmation by a test in which the diagnosis of covid-19 is based on clinical or epidemiological criteria probable or suspected 26 for the purpose of decision-making this document uses the following differential definitions for suspected or probable for those who survive the disease it defines cases as probable -when the patient has an acute respiratory disease ie with fever and at least one sign or symptom of respiratory disease such as coughing or difficulty breathing for example without any other aetiology that could completely explain the clinical manifestations and with a history of travel or residency in a country area or territory where local transmission of covid-19 had been reported during the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms -when a patient with an acute respiratory disease has been in contact with a confirmed or probable case of covid-19 during the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms -when a patient with a severe acute respiratory infection ie fever and at least one sign or symptom of respiratory disease such as coughing or difficulty breathing for example and who required hospitalisation and has no other aetiology which completely explains the clinical manifestations the same who document defines suspected cases as those which are probable for which the laboratory test for covid-19 has been performed without conclusive results other bodies in different countries have expressed themselves in the same terms for recommendations on mdc-bed in this pandemic 27 28 29 the italian model 29 has the peculiarity that the chain of events in its model is inverted respecting what is usual it starts with the basic cause and ends with the immediate cause as we said the general procedure for managing and reporting deaths is shown in figure 2  in spain and other countries there has been clear controversy regarding the number of deaths caused by covid-19 30 the daily mortality data for all causes is obtained from the general notaries registry of births marriages and deaths of the ministry of justice distributed among all of the autonomous communities and including 52 provincial capitals during the year 2020 the mortality monitoring system momo in spain includes deaths due to all causes from 3929 computerised registry offices through inforeg representing 92 of the spanish population 31 during this crisis a delay has been observed in recording deaths in the ro due to the high number of deaths and the effects on working of the measures established because of the state of emergency for this reason the general board of judicial security and public trust of the ministry of justice issued a circular so that the heads of the ro sent the number of burial licences issued every day to the ministry of justice nevertheless these measures do not include information on the causes of death swift and direct reporting of mortality registrations and the causes of the same would help to achieve a suitable level of knowledge regarding mortality in an epidemic crisis such as the current one the procedure for reporting deaths to the ine by the ro currently consists of the monthly remittance of mdc-bed to the provincial offices of the ine in terms of reporting deaths the implementation of data transmission to report deaths would speed the process up and make this communication faster regarding obtaining information from the ro corera 32 defends applying the new ro law as soon as possible 4 with a single computerised and electronically accessible ro for the whole of spain deaths will be reported by data transmission when it comes into force and this will as the author says undoubtedly offer faster knowledge of deaths until such time as data transmission is used it may be useful to establish exceptional procedures such as the one introduced in castile-la mancha 33 other suggestions such as the participation of the legal medicine and forensic sciences institutes imlcf in specific mortality monitoring systems would make it possible to learn of deaths in real time as well as their causes in circumstances as exceptional as the current ones this participation is based on the supervision of mdc-bed by forensic doctors working for the ro in some imlcf in spain this task which is usually restricted to large towns could be expanded to the monitoring of the mdc-bed received in all of the ro in this community thus the imlcf would report daily on the information contained in the mdc-bed to the public health services of each community this participation which has been successfully undertaken in castilla y len would bring great added value to the usual notification circuits from a practical point of view we should be able to access sufficient death certificates certificates that can be accessed in the provincial com in a pandemic and especially in one where lockdown measures have been applied fast and simple remittance mechanisms must be available between the com and undertakers or medical organisations to conclude we underline that filling out a mdc-bed is an important medical act it requires evaluation of the whole pathological history of the patient and it helps to humanise communications with the patients family in circumstances of intense emotional suffering mortality reporting methods have to be improved creating the possibility of certification using data transmission in epidemics and pandemics it is necessary to issue clear recommendations on certification by official bodies and establish if data transmission cannot be used faster circuits that make it possible to know mortality rates in real time   embracing telemedicine into your otolaryngology practice amid the covid-19 crisis an invited commentary kim pollock michael setzen peter svider f   many people use the terms telehealth and telemedicine interchangeably but the definitions are not the same telehealth is a broad term that includes telemedicine as one type of service the health resources and services administration hrsa of the dhhs defines telehealth as the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical health care patient and professional health-related education public health and health administration 2 the hrsa goes on to saytelehealth is different from telemedicine because it refers to a broader scope of remote healthcare services than telemedicine while telemedicine refers specifically to remote clinical services telehealth can refer to remote non-clinical services such as provider training administrative meetings and continuing medical education in addition to clinical services3
 cms refers to many remote clinical services at telehealth visits as opposed to calling them telemedicine services for purposes of this commentary we use the term virtual services to encompass four types of billable services1telehealth services medicares term and telemedicine services2telephone services calls3virtual check-ins and4e-visitsdigital online services
 the phe surrounding the covid-19 pandemic is the time to think out of the box and consider practicing in alternative and historically unconventional ways quick implementation of new processes and novel ways of providing otolaryngic care is key to short-term practice sustainability many practices have implemented changes overnight or very short-term such as consolidating multiple practice sites to a single site and drive by allergy injections given in the practices parking lot to prevent staff exposure to the covid-19 virus implementing virtual services in your otolaryngology practice now is essential to maintaining current and future clinical and financial viability additionally practices have had to do something practice management consultants have rarely recommended - holding claims for a period of time such as a week - to ensure compliance with payor billing guidelines effective for services retroactive to march 1 2020 and for the duration of the covid-19 phe medicare will make payment for virtual services furnished to patients in broader circumstances and with relaxed requirements 4 table 1
illustrates variations in key guidelines for medicares telehealth services guidelines prior to and during the phe cms continues to require an interactive real-time audio and video telecommunication system for evaluation and management em telehealth visits 99201-99215 a telephone call without the real-time video component does not meet the requirements for billing telehealth visit codes 99201-99215 to medicare refer to the section on telephone calls below for more information on audio without video services cms has relaxed the rules requiring a hipaa-secured platform and now allows non-hipaa-secure applications for video chats including apple facetime zoom doxyme facebook messenger video chat google hangouts video skype etc applications that are public facing and not allowed include facebook live twitch and tiktok practices must notify patients that any third-party application potentially introduces privacy risks prior to the phe medicare paid performing providers at a reduced rate the facility payment rate for telehealth services reported using pos 02 telehealth however for all dates of service march 1 2020 through the end of the current phe medicare will pay the same amount for virtual services as it would if the service was provided in person medicares non-facility rate will now be paid for claims submitted with pos 11 office which is a higher rate than payment for claims billed with pos 22 on campus-outpatient hospital or pos 19 off campus-outpatient hospital claims submitted with a pos in a hospital setting eg 22 19 will be paid at medicares facility rate claims submitted with a pos of 02 telehealth because the service would have been performed via telehealth means will also be paid at medicares facility rate for example an established patient who would normally have been seen in the physician office is now seen using a real-time audio and video platform eg apple facetime doxyme an established patient visit cpt code 9921x is reported using pos 11 and the non-facility payment allowable will be paid modifier 95 must be appended to the em code reported which will be discussed later in this commentary cms allows payment for virtual services to the following providers typically seen in otolaryngology practicesphysiciansnon-physician practitioners npp nurse practitioners nps physician assistants pas clinical nurse specialists cnss andtherapists such as speech-language pathologist slps and physical therapists pts
 cms allows payment to audiologists only for diagnostic testing services therefore audiologists will not be paid by medicare for telehealth services a list of current procedural terminology cpt codes that may be used for synchronous real-time two-way telemedicine services is in appendix p of the cpt codebook the individual cpt codes are noted by the star symbol  in the cpt codebook cms provides a list of covered cpt codes for what medicare refers to as telehealth visits which include 9920x new patient visit and 9921x established patient visit codes and require use of a real-time audio and video modality the entire list can be found at httpswwwcmsgovmedicaremedicare-general-informationtelehealthtelehealth-codes recently 80 new cpt codes were added to the list which include some therapy services medicare also reimburses virtual check-in services as well as e-visits digital em services and now also pays for telephone calls 99441-99443 98966-98968 during the phe cms does not consider e-visits virtual check-ins and telephone calls to be telehealth services medicare has always included new patient 9920x and established patient visit 9921x codes on the approved list of telehealth services prior to the phe medicare followed cpt guidelines for documentation of the key components history examination and medical decision making it was difficult for otolaryngologists to code higher levels of new patient em codes 9920x because all 3 of the 3 key components  history and examination and medical decision making  were required medicare now allows the em code for telehealth visits assuming real-time audio and video 99201-99215 to be chosen based solely on medical decision making existing guidelines  not the new 2021 guidelines or total amount of time 1 the history and examination component documentation requirements have been waived during the phe however dont forget that a clinically necessary history and examination will still be needed to obtain prior authorization for diagnostic testing eg ct mri allergy andor surgery as a reminder medical decision making complexity is chosen based on 2 of the following 3 elements1number of diagnoses or management options2amount andor complexity of data to be reviewed and3risk of complications andor morbidity or mortality
 this is good news for otolaryngologists who would otherwise have chosen a lower level em code because the examination component was not met the approved medicare telehealth visit codes 99201-99215 and their respective type of medical decision making are illustrated in table 2
 alternatively the telehealth visit code 99201-99215 may be chosen based on the total provider time total time is now defined as the total amount of time the billing provider incurs on the day of the visit this includes time preparing for the service and does not have to meet face-to-face counseling guidelines support staff time should not be included the typical amount of time for each telehealth visit em code table 3 table 4
 must be met or exceeded to choose the cpt code be sure to have good documentation of the mdm or time  whichever you use to choose the level of billed em code 
table 5
illustrates the two most common modifiers used to report telehealth andor telemedicine services medicare stopped the use of modifier gt via interactive audio and video telecommunication systems in 2017 when the place of service code 02 telehealth was introduced however many private payors are still using modifier gt the remaining two scenarios where a different modifier is needed are not common in otolaryngology these areabilling under critical access hospital method ii  use modifier gt via interactive audio and video telecommunication systems orbthe service is furnished for purposes of diagnosis and treatment of an acute stroke  use modifier g0 g zero telehealth services furnished for purposes of diagnosis evaluation or treatment of symptoms of an acute stroke
 cms is not requiring modifier cr catastrophedisaster related on telehealth service codes at this time check with private payors to determine their policies for using modifiers when reporting telehealthtelemedicine services medicare has relaxed the place of service rule that required a more formal originating site for telehealth visits during this phe the patients home is now an approved place of service and all facilities are now approved originating sites in other words there are now no site of service or geographical limitations for the patient or the provider for telehealth visits 99201-99215 do not use a pos 12 home on the claim for any virtual service if the provider is furnishing the telehealth service from their own home list the providers home address in box 32 service location on the claim the pos code is still where the service would normally have been provided to the patient such as pos 11 for physician office or pos 22 for on-campus-outpatient hospital eg hopd-hospital outpatient department telehealth visit using hipaa-secure platform state name of platform such as doxyme or zoom for healthcare history this is an 89-year-old male seen at the request of dr internist for a left parotid mass the history is documented and exam is within normal limits except complete paralysis of the left frontal branch and the branch of the left upper lip of the facial nerve as well as slight weakness of the left mandibular branch a ct scan of the neck ordered by the internist revealed an enlarged left parotid gland diagnosis left parotid mass with facial nerve paralysis plan i reviewed the ct scan with the patient and counseled him about a possible left parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy in the postoperative setting the indications alternatives benefits and risks were explained to the patient and his wife they understand the need for surgery and we will schedule this as soon as possible considering the potential risk of exposure to covid-19 at his advanced age an in-office exam will be carried out once the covid-19 crisis settles down or the mass increases in size comments the history and examination documented do not count toward choosing the level of em code during the phe the medical decision making mdm is moderate complexity because there is a new problem that does not need a work-up diagnosis and management options 3 points and a management option selected of elective major surgery risk moderate and the scans reviewed is limited data 2 points the mdm supports 99204 a 79-year-old female is seen via apple facetime while the patient was in her home and the otolaryngologist was in her own home this is a follow up for history of laryngopharyngeal reflux lpr with recurrence after a recent upper respiratory infection uri she had previously been treated with omeprazole and had done well and able to stop medication but had to restart recently due to the uricough her symptoms have persisted about a month and she has a foreign body sensation in her mid-throat she restarted her omeprazole 20 mg twice a day which seems to be helping pertinent review of systems is negative exam shows a well-developed well-nourished and well-groomed female appearing her stated age in no acute distress and without cough at this time diagnosis is probably recurrence of lpr the patient will continue twice a day omeprazole for at least another 4 weeks she will follow up if symptoms persist and we will proceed with direct laryngoscopy to further evaluate she was advised to contact us immediately if her symptoms worsen additionally she was advised to avoid alcohol caffeine not eat within 4 h prior to bedtime and call the office if not improved comments the history and examination documented dont count toward choosing the level of em code during the phe the medical decision making mdm is low complexity because there is an established problem diagnosis and management options 2 points that is worsening and a presenting problem of a chronic condition with exacerbation risk moderate with no data reviewed or ordered the mdm supports 99213 
table 6
summarizes key billing and coding parameters for the above new patient and established patient examples the hhs office of inspector general oig is allowing provider to reduce or waive cost sharing for telehealth services paid by federal healthcare programs 5 note that medicare is not waiving the patients financial obligation rather they are allowing the provider to waive the patients portion some commercial payors are waiving the patients portion and reimbursing the physician at the full allowable otolaryngology practices should monitor explanation of benefit eobs forms also called remittance advice to ensure optimal payment and accurate adjustments the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act temporarily suspended the mandatory 2 sequestration to the physician allowable during this phe the bad news is that that the cares act extends the sequestration policy through 2030 in exchange for this temporary suspension 6 the facility that hosts the patient and telecommunications means remotedistant from the telemedicine provider may report q3014 to obtain payment for the expense incurred for the remote providers evaluation originating facility site also called hosting facility expenses include but are not limited to cost of the telecommunication originating site staff equipment and the usual expense incurred to provide a service originating sites include a physicians office site remote to the telemedicine provider hospital rural health clinic skilled nursing facility and others identified by cms the originating site files a claim for q3014 with place of service code pos 02 telehealth during this phe the patient will be at home for most telemedicine services provided by otolaryngologists the patients home is not considered an approved originating site that qualifies for use of q3014 hcpcs ii code q3014 should not be submitted to a payor by the distant otolaryngologist the telephone call cpt codes 99441-99443 98966-98968 were previously non-covered and not payable by medicare however telephone em services are now paid by medicare for new and established patients due to the covid-19 pandemic additionally while cpt states these codes are for established patients medicare now allows payment for telephone only em codes for new patients the telephone em codes are shown in table 7
 physicians and npps called other qualified health care professionals by cpt eg physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists that bill using their own npi should use 99441-99443 qualified non-physician health care professionals such as speech-language pathologists and physical therapists should use codes 98966-98968 for telephone assessment and management services as shown in the table below the codes below are not payable for services provided by auxiliary personnel such as registered nurses rns licensed vocational nurseslicensed practical nurses lvnslpns medical assistants mas nursing assistants nas etc cms also requires that therapists use the appropriate therapy modifier gp for pts gn for slps for their services remember cms allows payment to audiologists only for diagnostic testing and not for telephone calls and does not pay for telephone services provided by auxiliary personnel modifier 95 is not appended to the telephone call codes 99441-99443 or 98966-98968 since cms does not consider these codes to be telehealth services virtual check-ins g2010 g2012 may now be performed for both new and established patients even though the code descriptor states established patient the purpose of these hcpcs ii codes is to determine whether an em visit 9920x 9921x is needed these services are initiated by the patient again cms allows payment to audiologists only for diagnostic testing and not for virtual check-ins and does not pay for these services if provided by auxiliary personnel the descriptor for g2010 isremote evaluation of recorded video andor images submitted by an established patient eg store and forward including interpretation with follow-up with the patient within 24 business hours not originating from a related em service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to an em service or procedure within the next 24 h or soonest available appointment
 the intent of g2010 is for the physician or other qualified practitioner such as an npp to review photos or video information eg recording of a cough submitted by the patient to determine if a visit is required the service may now be provided to a new or established patient when a related evaluation and management em service has not been provided in the previous seven days and does not lead to an em service within the next 24 h or soonest available appointment the provider responds to the patient by patient portal if an office visit or other service eg em service is needed and it is scheduled within 24 h or the soonest available appointment then g2010 would not be reported cms now allows therapists to report g2010 and the appropriate therapy modifier gp for pts gn for slps must be appended the descriptor for hcpcs ii code g2012 isbrief communication technology-based service eg virtual check-in by a physician or other qualified health care professional who can report evaluation and management services provided to an established patient not originating from a related em service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to an em service or procedure within the next 24 h or soonest available appointment 510 min of medical discussion
 the intent of g2012 is that a physician or npp would conduct a virtual check-in lasting 5 to 10 min using a telephone or other telecommunication device to determine whether an office visit or other service is needed if an office visit or other service eg em service is needed and it is scheduled within 24 h or the soonest available appointment then g2012 would not be reported cms now allows therapists report g2012 and the appropriate therapy modifier gp for pts gn for slps must be appended a telephone service code 99441-99443 may be reported by physicians or npps in place of g2012 if the time threshold is met and the service does not result in the need for an em service in the next 24 hnext available appointment or the service is related to a previous em service in the past 7 days cpt 99421 currently has a work relative value unit wrvu of 025 while the wrvu for g2012 is also 025 so there is no financial advantage for reporting one code over the other however the wrvus for 99442 and 99443 are 050 and 075 respectively be sure to document the amount of time spent on the service to support the billed code modifier 95 is not used with g2010 or g2012 because the codes are not considered a telehealth services by cms table 8
 there were new cpt codes in 2020 for online digital eg ehr portal email em services initiated by the patient without an image or video included with the communication the cpt codes are shown in table 9
 a code in table 9 may be reported by physicians or npps in place of g2010 if an image or video was sent with the communication if the time threshold is met cpt 99421 currently has a work relative value unit wrvu of 025 while the wrvu for g2010 is 018 medicare allows payment to slps and pts for online eg patient portal assessment and management of patients the hcpcs ii codes used by healthcare professionals who dont bill directly to medicare for em services are noted in table 10
 modifier 95 is not used on an e-visit cpt or hcpcs ii code because cms does not consider these to be telehealth services finally cms allows payment to audiologists only for diagnostic testing and not for online services and does not pay for online services provided by auxiliary personnel in summary table 11
provides a high level and brief summary of information for certain virtual services provided to medicare beneficiaries commercial payors and state medicaid plans may set their own rules many are paying for virtual services because they follow medicares guidelines practices are encouraged to survey their top 5 payors on a regular even daily basis during this phe to maintain compliance with payor guidelines otolaryngologists may find that providing telemedicinevirtual services has been beneficial to their practice during this phe we recommend the following two actions if telemedicinevirtual services are continued after the covid-19 pandemic1invest time and effort in exploring a long-term hipaa-secure platform if one is now not being used and2develop written practice policies and procedures for providing telemedicinevirtual services
 as otolaryngologists adapt to changing practice modalities during the covid-19 public health emergency we encourage them to embrace telemedicine and all types of virtual visits the center for medicare  medicaid services has relaxed guidelines during this time to facilitate non-face-to-face visits using non-hipaa-secure platforms medicares reimbursement for telehealth visits 99201-99215 using real-time interactive audio and video means will be at the same rate as the place of service the patient would normally have been seen eg non-facility rate for place of service 11 physician office facility rate for place of service 22 hospital outpatient otolaryngologists will likely find this method of patient care to be attractive and continue to incorporate virtual visits into their practices after the phe has ended a list of helpful resources is shown below

was first diagnosed in colombia from a traveler arriving from italy on february 26 2020 to date available data on the origins and number or introductions of sars-cov-2 into the country are limited here we sequenced sars-cov-2 from 43 clinical samples and-together with another 73 genomes sequences available from the country-we investigated the emergence and the routes of importation of covid-19 into colombia using epidemiological historical air travel and phylogenetic observations our study provided evidence of multiple introductions mostly from europe with at least 12 lineages being documented phylogenetic findings validated the linkage of epidemiologically-linked transmission chains our results demonstrate the advantages of genome sequencing to complement covid-19 outbreak investigation and underscores that human mobility and genetic data are relevant to complete epidemiological investigation and better characterize virus transmission dynamics at local scales  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a life-threatening respiratory illness caused by sars-cov-2 an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in wuhan city hubei province china 1 the first confirmed cases of covid-19 were reported on january 12 2020 from patients presenting respiratory symptoms between december 8 2019 and january 2 2020 2 despite early containment and mitigation measures set in place 3 the high infectiousness presymptomatic and prolonged transmission of sars-cov-2 45 combined with other factors such as globalization led to its rapid spread across the world  cc-by-nc-nd 40

effective in delaying the epidemic during the contention phase 6 7 8 9  however ensuing lockdowns and travel restrictions to minimize the healthcare burden has led to wellbeing decline and economic downturn with profound impacts in low-tomiddle income countries 10 the contention phase in colombia started with the first case of covid-19 confirmed by the instituto nacional de salud ins on march 6 2020 from a person returning from italy on february 26 2020 11on march 23 2020 314 cases had been confirmed which prompted the closure of all the country borders to contain the outbreak on march 31 2020 more than 10 of confirmed cases were missing from the contact-tracing infections linked to unknown sources and therefore the mitigation phase was declared with physical-distancing as the main strategy to further limit virus spread on june 18 2020 57046 confirmed cases and 1864 deaths had been reported in colombia 12 the unprecedented global health and societal emergency posed by the covid-19 pandemic urged unprecedented data sharing and faster-than-ever outbreak research developments which are reflected in the fact that over 37000 sars-cov-2 complete genomes have been made available through public databases mainly gisaid global initiative on sharing all influenza data genome availability and the fact that sars-cov-2 is an rna virus with an estimated substitution rate of around 0810 substitutionssiteyear 13 14  enabled us to detect the virus is fast generating genetic variation as it is transmitted and therefore genomic epidemiology is a powerful approach to characterize the outbreak 15  this approach which relies on phylogenetic analysis has allowed researchers across the world to ascertain sars-cov-2 emergence in humans to track its geographical spread

contacttracing efforts had been set in place multiple sequences were obtained from seven distinct early epidemiologically-linked transmission chains this information was mapped into the phylogeny  figure 2c  and all but one set of sequences did not group however it appeared very close in the tree this underscores the potential utility of genomic epidemiology to link individuals with incomplete information eg cases that end-up disconnected due to intermediate asymptomatic this study has some limitations firstly the geographical sources of infection relied on people to self-report their own symptoms onset and travel history which is subject to inaccuracies secondly we use air travel data from important destinations in colombia but other locations may also have fueled covid-19 emergence and dissemination in the country flight travel data was not available from march 9 2020 onwards thirdly the number of sequences sampled represented a tiny fraction of the documented number of imported cases into colombia the sample was selected to be a country-wide representative given limited resources for genome sequencing and consequently the introduced viral diversity may also have been underestimated another limitation of this analysis is the inherent uncertainty stemming from global unsystematic sampling therefore the inferences about the number of introductions and the corresponding geographical source need to be interpreted with caution we attempted to overcome this by undertaking sensitivity analyses and contrasting the results with the available epidemiological

together with information of sampling representativeness per country is needed in order to account for sampling uncertainty in a more statistically rigorous manner our study provided evidence that an important number of independent introductions occurred to colombia with at least 12 lineages documented most of the notified introductions occurred from europe and this observation was supported by phylogenetic and air travel data although the sequence data do not represent the actual number of epidemiologically-linked transmission chains our phylogenetic findings validated the linkage for those epidemiologicallylinked transmission chains with available sequence data our results further underscore the advantages of genome sequencing to complement covid-19 outbreak investigation and support

chi-wing alexandros ntoulas ee-peng lim see-kiong ng sinno pan jialin hao wang huawei shen xueqi cheng   with the development of mobile internet location-based social networks lbsns 6 such as yelp and foursquare have emerged in recent years in lbsns users can share their experiences and tips for point-of-interests pois 2 eg restaurants and sightseeing sites in the form of check-ins 14 the rapid growth of lbsns has attracted billions of users promoting our urban experience to a new stage 17 to benefit lbsn users and promote location-based marketing poi recommendation on lbsns has become an essential task aiming to recommend new pois to a user according to his personal preferences and to facilitate his exploration of the city 18 different from traditional item recommendation eg movie recommendation poi recommendation is highly context-dependent first locations of pois are important factors for poi recommendations since users prefer to visit pois that are not far away for example in gowalla and foursquare 90 of users consecutive check-ins are within the distance less than 50km 15 second users preference over pois exhibit salient temporal periodic patterns eg restaurants are preferred in dinner time and theaters are visited more frequently in weekend than in weekdays finally a users check-in records form a poi sequence with continuous distance and time intervals offering various sequential patterns 12 eg pois planned in a trip in sum users check-in records contain rich spatial-temporal context information that should be synthetically integrated to reflect the dynamics of the underlying check-in system many methods have been proposed to exploit geographical influence 3 11 18 20 temporal periodic patterns 5 22 25 and sequential dependency 1 4 12 13 23 24 lying in users check-ins for improving the performance of poi recommendation however these methods only partially leverage the spatial context and temporal context and they integrate these contexts using a global weighting scheme 9 19 25 assuming that the importance of each context is unchanged for all pois these methods fail to capture the dynamic role of context given that the importance of each context is poi-specific lets say we are going to make poi recommendation to a big foodie at 3 pm we may push a restaurant to him considering his long-term preference as a foodie however recommending a restaurant must happen at the right time eg dinner time rather than 3 pm at which restaurant cannot meet the users current needs in this scenario where restaurant is a candidate poi we should inhibit the importance of users long-term preference and let the temporal context play a more decisive role in users check-in choice that is to say each contexts importance to current recommendation should be poi-specific in this paper we propose to model the spatial-temporal context for poi recommendation using an attention mechanism fig 1 temporal context is represented as a low-dimensional vector capturing what type of poi is preferred for a specific temporal moment for spatial context due to the lack of location information of user we infer the spatial context by exploiting users check-in records obtaining a low-dimensional representation through an attention enhanced recurrent neural network finally a poi-guided attention mechanism is adopted to learn the importance of each context for each recommendation offering high flexibility to capture the dynamic nature of context we evaluate the proposed poi recommendation method by extensive experiments on two real-world datasets collected from foursquare and gowalla respectively experimental results show that the poi-specific context importance can significantly improve the performance of poi recommendation compared with state-of-the-art methods in this section we make a brief discussion on related works check-in is the main inferential evidence for poi recommendation 3 20 due to its nature as implicit feedback researchers utilize the weighted matrix factorization 10 or pairwise ranking methods 7 9 to model it geographical influence has been proved to be effective in improving poi recommendation accuracy with a parameterized distribution to model the distance influence 3 10 16 20 moreover wang et al 18 propose to model poi-specific geographical influence which captures the asymmetry and high variation of geographical influence between pois periodic pattern has attracted much attention from researchers they split one day into multiple time slots and exploit the check-in pattern in each time slot in terms of temporal non-uniformness and consecutiveness 5 22 sequential dependency has been exploited in recent years many methods based on matrix factorization 13 markov models 4 23 24 word2vec 14 or rnn 12 have been proposed to learn the transitive patterns between pois however the above methods only partially exploit the spatial-temporal context and integrate these contexts using a global weighting scheme 9 19 25 given that the importance of each context is poi-specific considering that the attention mechanism can automatically model and select pertinent piece of information from a set of inputs and achieve good performance in many neural network-based tasks 8 in this paper we design a poi-guided attention mechanism to address the above issue for ease of presentation we first introduce the notations used in this paper we denote u and v the user set and poi set with u and i representing a user and a poi respectively each poi is location is denoted by its longitude and latitude ie documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentduenddocument we aim to provide a list of pois which are not visited and potentially preferred by a target user u at a target time t whether a poi will be chosen is sensitive to the spatial-temporal context eg restaurant is popular at dinner time and the temporal context plays a more decisive role compared with other factors in this scenario likewise if user is on a food street restaurant is also popular and the spatial context becomes more decisive therefore we need a model that can automatically adjust the importance of the involved context to users current preference and the idea comes to fruition in the proposed star model by using a poi-guided attention mechanism star infers a target user us preference to a candidate poi j at a target time t by capturing the dynamic influence of the spatial context and the temporal context besides user us long-term preference to characterize the influence of each factor we learn the following latent vectors in stardocumentclass12ptminimal

 figure 2 present the hitk and mrrk of the proposed star model and its variants respectively we can observe that removing any attention would cause performance degradation on both datasets this phenomenon indicates that a global weighting scheme cannot effectively organize multiple heterogeneous contexts and the attention mechanism plays a critical role while integrating the spatial-temporal contexts figure 3 and fig 4 present the hitk and mrrk of the star and baseline methods respectively it can be observed that the proposed star method achieves the best performance under different settings of k on both datasets and both metrics which demonstrates the superiority of our method to these state-of-the-art methods

 we take a detailed account of fig 3 as an example since ug considers only the geographical influence it gets the worst performance utg further incorporates temporal periodic patterns time slot in a day resulting in a slightly better performance than ug fpmf-lr and st-rnn consider the sequential dependency and ignore the temporal periodic patterns and its performance is better than that of utg this indicates that sequential dependence is crucial to poi recommendation st-rnn outperforms fpmc-lr in most cases except the case of documentclass12ptminimal

 we have the following observations 1 u visited the first 5 pois in consecutive 5 days as expected the impact of the spatial context increases constantly while the impact of users long-term preference becomes negligible 2 when predicting the 9th poi the impact of the spatial context becomes very weak which results from the fact that this check-in is more than one month away from the 8th check-in this check-in is mainly triggered by users long-term preference since we find in the dataset that the 9th poi is the second most frequently visited poi among all check-ins of u 3 the main reason for the last check-in is the temporal context ie temporal periodic patterns 2111 we guess that the last poi is a place for relax as most check-ins at this poi occurred at non-working hours in this paper we propose a new poi recommendation framework to dynamically integrate the spatial-temporal context we use a low-dimensional vector to capture the temporal context and infer the spatial context by mining a users check-in history through an attention enhanced recurrent neural network we integrate the spatial-temporal context with users long-term preference using another poi-guided attention which can distinguish the importance of each context for recommendation in this way we can flexibly and accurately capture the dynamic nature of different contexts we perform sufficient experiments on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for poi recommendation  journal pre-proof allergic respiratory disease care in the

spring and summer 2020 are unique in that the challenges of care for those suffering from pollen allergy coincide with the covid-19 pandemic several considerations are important to allow optimal care of allergic rhinitis ar and asthma and hence prevention of coronavirus spread through sneezing rhinorrhoea and coughing this compact overview of recommendations by the euforea expert teams on allergic airway diseases and ait is based on investigation of the current covid-19 literature in association with the key words above and shared clinical experience of the experts involved it deals with similarities and differences between ar and coronavirus infection specific recommendations for allergic disease care in the covid-19 era including guidance on allergen specific immunotherapy ait key words allergy rhinitis asthma treatment control covid-19 symptoms smell and taste allergen immunotherapy acute covid-19 infection and onset of seasonal allergic rhinitis sar share a few similarities in their phenotype but also differences whereas covid-19 commonly presents as a flu-like illness with fever and persistent cough as its main symptoms there is evidence of milder disease especially in younger people according to the who some patients may also have a runny nose sore throat nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea some suffer profound sudden and complete loss of smell and taste 1  about 80 of covid-19 sufferers experience a mild case -of similar severity to a common cold -and recover without needing any special treatment 2  this clinical presentation might be confused with seasonal allergic rhinitis especially in those new to such symptoms figure 1 shows the overlap and the major differentiating features cough and fever are the most prominent symptoms of covid-19 whereas conjunctivitis and itching point to allergic rhinitis as the diagnosis given the global covid-19 threat to mankind in spring 2020 and the fact that 44of all transmission occurs from asymptomatic people 3 it is very important to keep sar under the best possible control so as to diminish symptoms particularly those of sneezing rhinorrhoea and coughing which could be responsible for viral spread to others via aerosol formation in those who do not realise that they also have covid-19 sar patients are strongly recommended to keep social distancing to wear a mask to avoid aerosol formation when sneezing or speaking to carry spare masks and tissues and bin them safely after use it would be sensible where possible for sar patients to be tested for the sars-cov-2 virus since they could be potent viral spreaders therapy for sar is best started early and used regularly throughout the relevant pollen season none of the recommended treatments for sar are contra-indicated other than systemic corticosteroids the euforea treatment algorithm figure 2  provides useful guidance which remains relevant there is no contraindication to the use of intranasal corticosteroids ins this is the concerted view of over 90 of experts 4 ins do not reduce immunity in fact they normalize the structure and function of the nasal mucosa 5 and do not in vivo adversely affect mucociliary clearance 6  there are even preliminary data indicating that some corticosteroids eg ciclesonide and mometasone may suppress coronavirus replication 7  however systemic corticosteroids should be avoided as they may suppress the human immune system similarly asthma inhalers should be continued as before and taken regularly increasing the dose if needed to maintain control in the pollen season inhaled corticosteroids ics and ics combinations with bronchodilators long acting beta agonists laba are known to protect against virally-induced asthma exacerbations and may be beneficial in covid-19 8  also treatment with biologicals for patients with more severe asthma and severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps should be continued to avoid aggravation of these diseases as per guidelines 9although the cdc advises that people with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from covid-19 covid-19 can affect your respiratory tract nose throat lungs cause an asthma attack and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease 10  asthma may not be a potent risk factor 8  it is already known that children in whom respiratory allergy is common often have very mild disease in the first report from wuhan on 140 patients with severe covid-disease none of the patients reported allergic rhinitis or asthma despite a prevalence of ar of nearly 20 in china 11 12 more recently an italian report on 3200 covid-19 positive deceased patients did not mention asthma among coexisting diseases 13  ongoing allergen-specific immunotherapy ait should be continued if feasible within the health care system as long as no covid-19 infection has been diagnosed new ait treatment with subcutaneous injections scit is not advised because of the necessity for repeated visits to a physician or hospital however the initiation of sublingual immunotherapy slit which mandates only one initial dose under supervision 14 should be preferred or a switch to slit from scit considered when there is a suitable alternative to scit for the allergen in question ait should be performed only with registered allergen products which have been proven to be efficacious 15  management of covid-19 is supportive with experimental use of drugs mainly in clinical trials which may include patients with allergic airway disease oral corticosteroids may be needed under supervision in covid-infected asthma patients for severe virus-evoked exacerbations avoidance of nsaids which was suggested for all possible patients 16 then revoked 17 remains vital in nsaid-sensitive asthma  early mild covid-19 symptoms may be confused with or co-occurrent with allergic rhinitis  proper treatment of allergic rhinitis is very important at this time as uncontrolled hay fever may increase the risk of viral dissemination  such therapy including ait is not immunosuppressive and does not represent a risk factor for more severe covid19-induced disease  topical and inhaled corticosteroids may even be beneficial or preventative for covid-19 infection  allergic airway disease is probably not a risk factor for more severe covid 19 disease however asthma control can worsen with viral infections treatment algorithm for ar as proposed by euforea taking into account the reality of patient phenotypes and existing international guidelines wwweuforeaorg treatments suggested are possible during the covid-19 pandemic with the exception of the use of systemic corticosteroids which should be avoided as they may be immunosuppressive the symbol  means more than   joint geographical and temporal modeling based on matrix factorization for point-of-interest recommendation joemon jose m emine yilmaz joo magalhes pablo castells nicola ferro mrio silva j flvio martins hossein rahmani a mohammad aliannejadi mitra baratchi fabio crestani   with the availability of location-based social networks lbsns such as yelp and foursquare users can share their locations experiences and content associated with the point-of-interests pois via check-ins employing the successes in the area of recommender systems rss poi recommendation helps to improve the user experiences on lbsns suggesting pois according to users past check-in history poi recommendation helps users explore new interesting pois while helping businesses to increase their revenues by providing context-aware advertisements as such poi recommendation has attracted much attention from both research and industry 4 6 22 one of the most important challenges that limit the accuracy of poi recommendation is the data sparsity problem 1 25 26 numerous users are active on lbsns with millions of pois already being listed on these platforms however in practice users are able to only visit a very limited number of pois hence the user-poi matrix used in different collaborative filtering cf approaches becomes sparse limiting the attainable recommendation accuracy 3 24 to address this problem several studies have incorporated contextual information such as geographical and temporal influences separately into their model 7 21 30 31 for example relevant studies have tried to incorporate geographical 9 21 28 and temporal influences 16 20 27 in their proposed model moreover as argued in 911 users commonly check in to pois around several geographical centers while modeling these centers it is assumed that they are static and do not change according to temporal information this assumption may not be correct and taking into account both geographical and temporal influences might help to model the users behavior with a higher accuracy for instance if we consider working time and leisure time this suggests that users tend to explore pois around their activity centers in leisure time while they prefer to visit the same locations more often while they are at work for example a person would go to the same restaurant every day to have lunch while working during the weekdays however the same user might decide to visit a more diverse set of pois and visit new places while on holidays ie leisure time therefore the users check-in behavior and activity centers are dependent on their temporal states eg working time vs leisure time to elaborate more in fig 1 we have depicted a randomly selected users check-ins from the gowalla dataset 22 during working and leisure time as seen this user follows a temporal center-based check-in pattern that is the activity centers are different at different temporal states also while we compare fig 1a with figs 1b and c we see that the activity centers are different from each temporal state compared to all the check-ins based on these observations we conclude that joint modeling of geographical and temporal information is an effective approach for defining users activity centers in this paper we take a step for joint modeling of geographical and temporal information our contributions can be summarized as follows
we propose a novel contextual model that jointly considers both geographical and temporal informationwe propose a spatio-temporal activity-centers model that consider users center-based behavior in different temporal stateswe propose static and temporal mf models to study the users preference and behavior both in static and temporal manners in the static mf we train the model on the whole user-poi matrix whereas in the temporal mf we train the model using different user-poi matrices for every time slotwe address the data sparsity problem by incorporating the proposed contextual model into the traditional mf model and propose a novel mf framework
 we conduct several experiments on two well-known real-world datasets namely gowalla and foursquare demonstrating the improvement of the proposed method in the accuracy of poi recommendation compared to a number state-of-the-art approaches our experiments show that joint modeling of the geographical and temporal influence improves the performance of poi recommendation finally to enable reproducibility of the results we have made our codes open source1
 poi recommendation plays an essential role in improving lbsns user experience much work has been carried out in this area based on the core idea behind recommendation systems assuming that users with similar behavioral histories tend to act similarly 28 collaborative filtering cf-based recommendation approaches aim to base recommendations on the similarity between users and items 14 16 poi recommendation considers a large number of available pois items while a single user can only visit a few of them hence cf-based approaches applied to poi recommendation often suffer from the data sparsity problem this leads to poor performance in poi recommendation many studies have tried to address the data sparsity problem of cf approaches incorporating additional information into the model 5 21 22 28 as the users check-in behavior follows a spatio-temporal mobility pattern much work has incorporated this critical information considering users movement trajectories between pois many of the previous studies have shown that geographical influence is one of the most important factors in poi recommendation 22 24 more specifically ye et al 28 argued that a users check-in behavior is affected by the geographical influence of pois following the power-law distribution and proposed a unified poi recommender system incorporating spatial and social influences to address the data sparsity problem ference et al 14 took into consideration several factors such as user preference geographical proximity and social influences for out-of-town poi recommendation this work however did not take into account users temporal information and in-town users behavior cheng et al 9 10 modeled users check-ins via center-based gaussian distribution to capture users movement patterns based on the assumption that users movements consist of several centers li et al 21 in another work modeled the poi recommendation task as a pairwise ranking loss where they exploited the geographical information using an extra factor matrix zhang et al 31 proposed a method that considered the geographical influence on each user separately to this end they proposed a model based on kernel density estimation of the distance distributions between poi check-ins per user aliannejadi et al 2 proposed a ranking model and predicted the appropriateness of a poi given a users context into the ranking process yuan et al 29 addressed the data sparsity problem based on the idea that users tend to rank higher those pois that are geographically closer to their visited pois guo et al 17 proposed a location neighborhood-aware weighted matrix factorization model to exploit the location perspective that incorporates the geographical relationships among pois more recently aliannejadi et al 6 proposed a two-phase collaborative ranking algorithm for poi recommendation that takes into account the geographical influence of pois in the same neighborhood another line of research studies the temporal influence on users preferences 13 30 32 temporal information has been shown to improve poi recommendation accuracy and alleviate the problem of data sparsity 22 griesner et al 16 proposed an approach to integrate temporal influences into matrix factorization gao et al 15 computed the similarity between users by dividing users check-ins into different hourly time slots and finding the same pois at the same time slots in their check-in history to train a user-based cf model yao et al 27 matched the temporal regularity of users with the popularity of pois to improve a factorization-based algorithm le et al 20 proposed a time-aware personalized model adopting a fourth-order tensor factorization-based ranking which enables to capture short-term and long-term preferences yuan et al 30 preserved the similarity of personal preference in consecutive time slots by considering different latent variables at each time slot per user zhao et al 33 proposed a latent ranking method to model the temporal interactions among users and pois explicitly in particular the proposed model builds upon a ranking-based pairwise tensor factorization framework these previous approaches mainly explored the geographical and temporal information separately differently from these studies our work addresses the data sparsity problem by jointly modeling the geographical and temporal contextual information moreover the previous research modeled users center-based behavior based on geographical influence in contrast we consider the formation of spatio-temporal activity centers for each user therefore we model the users center-based behavior based on different temporal states in this section we propose a spatio-temporal activity center poi recommendation model called stacp which models users preference and users context together in the users preference model we design two preference functions for each user to consider both static and temporal users preferences in the model moreover in the users context model we incorporate the influence of geographical and temporal information jointly in what follows we first describe an overview of our stacp model and further explain how each part is implemented and which challenges are addressed at each part formally let documentclass12ptminimal

 performance evaluation against compared methods table 1 shows the results of experiments based on the gowalla and foursquare datasets as seen stacp obtains the best performance compared to the other poi recommendation methods in terms of all evaluation metrics on both of the datasets dacrema et al in 12 show that even some state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods are not able to outperform a non-personalized method such as toppopular this is the reason why we have also selected this method as a baseline to compare with stacp it seems that in comparison to two non-personalized baseline methods toppopular and pfm our method achieves significantly better performance comparing with other geographical-based methods pfmpd pfmmgm iglsr and l-wmf it is seen that stacp followed by rank-geofm perform best one reason for the performance of rank-geofm is that it considers the geographical neighborhoods as a major element in the factorization method also rank-geofm takes a ranking approach to modeling the interactions between users and pois this means that instead of considering a point-wise loss function it applies a pairwise loss function in geographical factorization
 results show that stacp beats all geographical-based methods in terms of all metrics for all different values of n in both datasets this is expected as the previous models only consider the basic idea of the geographical influence that users tend to visit nearby pois also our proposed model outperforms the lrt and lmft that modeled temporal information to improve the accuracy of poi recommendation the reason is that these methods do not consider the geographical information compared to the neural baseline mlp the improvements of stacp in terms of recall20 and ndcg20 on gowalla dataset are documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentlambda enddocument that shows the impact of different temporal states is 05 this confirms our assumption and shows that users follow a spatio-temporal activity centered behavior in fact when we set this parameter to 1 ie just working time or 0 ie just leisure time the performance decreases
 in this paper we study the problem of poi recommendation we have investigated in detail the characteristics of the user mobility behavior on a large-scale check-in dataset based on the extracted properties we propose a novel spatio-temporal activity-centers model to jointly model the geographical and temporal influence of the users check-in behavior we then consider the users temporal information and the users preferences on pois finally we propose the stacp model as a uniform framework for combining these three components to recommend pois experimental results on the datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in our future work we may consider more information such as the users comments and social relations to improve the performance  sharing of fake news on social media application of the honeycomb framework and the third-person effect hypothesis shalini talwar amandeep dhir dilraj singh gurnam singh virk jari salo k somaiya j  fake news fake-news sharing behaviour honeycomb framework mixed-method research social media third-person effect a b s t r a c t sharing of fake news on social media platforms is a global concern with research offering little insight into the motives behind such sharing this study adopts a mixed-method approach to explore fake-news sharing behaviour to begin with qualitative data from 58 open-ended essays was analysed to identify six behavioural manifestations associated with sharing fake news thereafter research model hypothesizing the association between these behaviours was proposed using the honeycomb framework and the third-person effect hypothesis age and gender were the control variables two data sets obtained from cross-sectional surveys with 471 and 374 social media users were utilized to test the proposed model the study results suggest that instantaneous sharing of news for creating awareness had positive effect on sharing fake news due to lack of time and religiosity however authenticating news before sharing had no effect on sharing fake news due to lack of time and religiosity the study results also suggest that social media users who engage in active corrective action are unlikely to share fake news due to lack of time these results have significant theoretical and practical implications  the spread of fake news on the internet is a cause of great concern for all members of society including the government policymakers organisations businesses and citizens fake news is specifically designed to plant a seed of mistrust and exacerbate the existing social and cultural dynamics by misusing political regional and religious undercurrents wardle and derakhshan 2017  shu et al 2017 argue that fake news has an adverse impact on individuals and society as it deliberately persuades consumers to accept false beliefs that are shared to forward specific agendas the circulation of fake news poses significant challenges for organisations and brands in fact fake news that promotes a specific viewpoint or opinion about a product brand or organisation which may not be true can be deliberately designed to mislead consumers eg potthast et al 2017  for example consumers threatened to boycott mcdonalds after the fake news regarding its use of ground worm filler in its burgers became viral taylor 2016  some recent studies have also noted the impact of fake news on brands and organisations eg cheng and chen 2020 visentin et al 2019  such false information can potentially harm retailers interests by negatively influencing consumers intentions to buy conversely consumers may also be misled into buying certain products based on fake reviews which have been acknowledged as a form of online forgery martens and maalej 2019  thus fake news and its viral circulation have become a grave concern in the era of social media where anonymity user-generated content and geographical distance may encourage fake-news sharing behaviour while academic research on the dark aspects of social media use which includes information overload social media fatigue fear of missing out and coping strategies has intensified eg dhir et al 2018ab dhir et al 2019 luqman et al 2018 malik et al 2020  the perceptions and behaviours underlying the sharing of fake news are not clear in fact little is known about the motives for sharing disinformation on social media platforms smps eg jang and kim 2018 talwar et al 2019  we argue that understanding the reasons and associated behaviours that induce people to share falsehood online can help in identifying a solution to tackle the growing menace further a better understanding could also prove useful for marketers retailers brand managers policymakers and scholars thus the lack of studies on factors that exacerbate the fake-news sharing behaviour represents a gap in the literature that needs to be bridged the current study attempts to address this gap by examining the behaviour of smp users towards authentication and sharing of fake news the research questions rqs guiding this study are as follows rq1 what are the different manifestations of fake-news sharing behaviour on smps rq2 what are the potential associations between the manifestations of fake-news sharing behaviour of smp users this study uses a mixed-method approach mainly because of the limited literature on this topic we first conduct a qualitative study n  58 to identify the different behavioural manifestations associated with the sharing of fake news on smps the obtained qualitative data are analysed using grounded theory and the generated themes ie fakenews sharing behavioural manifestations are examined using the honeycomb framework which is a popular theoretical framework from social media literature kietzmann et al 2011  we use the framework to sort the different manifestations by relevance associations between the manifestations are examined via key theories in the field of media sociology psychology and information systems such as uses and gratifications theory katz et al 1974  social identity theory tajfel and turner 1986  social exchange theory malinowski 1922 and the socio-technical model of media effects marwick 2018  the associations are hypothesised using the third-person effect tpe davison 1983  tpe has been used recently in studies on sharing of fake news eg jang and kim 2018  our developed research model consists of four independent variables 1 active corrective action on fake news ac hereafter 2 passive corrective action on fake news pc hereafter 3 instantaneous sharing of news for creating awareness ins hereafter and 4 authenticating news before sharing online an hereafter the two dependent variables are sharing fake news due to lack of time lt hereafter and sharing fake news due to religiosity sr hereafter the model controls for age and gender the proposed model is tested with the help of two independent crosssectional studies n  471 374  the results showed that instantaneous sharing of news for creating awareness ins among social media users positively correlated with sharing fake news due to lack of time lt and religiosity sr however authenticating news before sharing an did not correlate with sharing fake news due to lt and sr further social media users who engaged in active corrective action ac were unlikely to share fake news due to lt these findings offer a theoretical foundation for further empirical examination of fake-news sharing behaviour an topic with limited literature deeper insights into fake-news sharing behaviour can also be useful to businesses looking for better strategies to protect themselves against the threat of unauthenticated news going viral the salient contributions of this study are as follows a it responds to urgent calls from scholars for empirical research on the spread of fake news b it shifts the focus of studies on fake news from detection methods to sharing behaviour which fuels the uncontrollable spread of falsehood c the study examines measures not used previously to model fake-news sharing behaviours by grounding them in a popular social media modelthe honeycomb frameworkand tests the associations of the proposed model by using a key media and psychology theorythirdperson perception tpp d it strengthens the debate on the link between consumer behaviour and fake news which has been an underexplored area and e finally the robustness of the methodology in terms of qualitative intervention and quantitative testing through multiple data sets enhances the studys validity and relevance the honeycomb is a popular framework that sheds light on the possible reasons for sharing of information on smps fig 1  developed by kietzmann et al 2011  the framework covers seven social media building blocks identity conversations sharing presence relationships reputation and groups table 1  scholars have used the honeycomb framework to study social media adoption ngai et al 2015  online recovery strategies azemi et al 2019  etc highlighting the shortage of frameworks and theories to analyse social media strategies effing and spil 2016 suggested that the framework serves as a reasonable basis for examining the various functions of social media given that the framework explores the reasons for exchange of information on smps it is ideal for the current studys focus on the dissemination process of fake news in this study we use it to better understand the emergent themes that represent the manifestations of fake-news sharing behaviour the proliferation of media has led us to consider the effect of so many media messages on us and our behaviour the tpe hypothesis proposed by davison 1983  explains that the receivers of such messages tend to believe that these messages will affect others more than themselves in other words tpe is based on the self-other difference that individuals perceive when they try to assess the effect of messages in media the theory can be understood through its two corollaries the first corollary comes from the perceptual component tpp which posits that individuals perceive that socially undesirable and negative media messages affect others more than themselves this view is supported by seminal studies that found that individuals overestimated the impact of socially undesirable content like gambling pornography and alcohol advertisements on others eg rojas et al 2012  houston et al 2011 argued that tpp for news with opinionated and biased comments was higher thus prior literature clearly suggests that the social desirability of messages in media is a key consideration in tpe and that undesirable messages are perceived to have bad effects on others the tpp part of tpe has also been explained in prior studies as a self-serving or a self-enhancement bias gunther and mundy 1993  that is individuals tend to project a superior image of themselves by showing that they are less susceptible to negative content than others at the same time they try to show that they are more receptive to socially desirable media messages the second corollary of tpe known as the social distance corollary is explained through the concept of social distance cohen et al 1988  according to the corollary individuals feel that those who are at a social distance from them are affected more by negative media messages than those closest to them this social distance can refer to inferiority in certain aspects geographical distance psychological attributes difference in status or other socio-demographic distinctions social distance causes individuals to act and protect others who they think are more gullible to undesirable messages circulated on media mcleod et al 2001  on the whole tpe implies that individuals feel that others are affected more by negative messages shared via media further they believe that the impact is higher on those who are at a greater social distance from them the tpe also indicates that individuals believe that media messages produce a greater change in the attitude of others in comparison to themselves davison 1983  our review of literature on tpe finds that social media scholars are increasingly interested in using this theory to better understand different online social media behaviours for example chung and moon 2016 found that tpp had an impact on attitudinal and behavioural responses to messages in the media scholars have extended the use of tpe beyond its original domains of application for instance when tpe was proposed originally it focused on actions such as censorship of media messages however recent research has introduced a new dimension of behaviour which is related to taking corrective action such corrective action includes attempts to counterbalance harmful outcomes barnidge and rojas 2014 and cope with the negative impact of socially undesirable messages lim 2017  endorsing the application of tpe to social media recently jang and kim 2018 used the theory for studying fake news and found a high perceptual corollary tpp their results also confirmed the social undesirability of content to be one of the positive predictors of tpp they also confirmed the presence of the social distance corollary by showing that individuals believed that fake news would affect out-group members more than them and their in-group members since the current study also explores fake-news sharing behaviour we find it appropriate to invoke this theory to explore the association between the explanatory and dependent constructs as part of the mixed-method approach of the study we first performed a qualitative intervention study a which resulted in an item pool of different measures for fake-news sharing behaviour the process resulted in the identification of six measures which included two forms of coping mechanisms for fake-news sharing behaviour ac and pc the other measures were ins an lt and sr the developed measures were examined using the honeycomb framework to understand their relevance to social media usage fig 2  we then developed the research model to examine the association between the six behavioural manifestations in the context of fake-news sharing behaviour fig 3  the study used tpe to examine the hypothesised associations the dependent variables were sr and lt and a model was proposed to test the influence of ins ac pc and an as explanatory variables the model was tested using two independent cross-sectional surveys study b1 n  471 study b2 n  374 the participants consisted of whatsapp users an open-ended essay-based study was conducted to understand fakenews sharing behaviour among 58 whatsapp users 534 females 20-23 years old the open-ended essays sought information on a the nature of fake newswhat it is and whether the respondents received fake news from others b actions taken by the respondents to check the authenticity of the received news or information c coping mechanisms reacting or responding used by respondents if they knowingly or unwittingly shared fake news d coping mechanisms reacting or responding used by respondents if their friends family and acquaintances knowingly or unwittingly shared fake news two independent cross-sectional data sets were generated with the help of a questionnaire based on study a in line with the approach used by many recent studies eg talwar et al 2020ab  both the surveys were conducted in india where a sampling frame of whatsapp users is not available therefore we used non-probability judgemental sampling to select survey participants participants of the surveys consisted of whatsapp users from northern india b1 n  471 and western india b2 n  374 the average age of the respondents in b1 was 21 years 42 males and in b2 was 20 years 45 males the mean age of the respondents was between 18-23 years in both data sets this specific age group was selected because the existing studies suggest that young adults are voracious users of smps smith and anderson 2018  the respondents were briefed about the objective of the study and responses were collected in person by one of the researchers the selection criterion was that the respondent should have used whatsapp actively at least in the past six months we defined active use as spending at least 1 h daily on whatsapp qualitative data were analysed using nvivo open codes from the qualitative data were identified and later classified using axial codes in order to develop key themes miles and huberman 1994  the obtained high-level themes were further evaluated on the basis of prior literature in line with the standard protocol in qualitative research to develop a pool of items hesse-biber and leavy 2011 the pool of items developed was later tested with a group of experts two university professors and three experts on social media research as recommended by extant findings saunders et al 2016  fifteen social media users who represented the target population of whatsapp users were invited to pilot-test the item pool this step helped us check the face validity of the items and determine whether they were clear in language and relevant to the study the developed measures representing fake-news sharing behaviour were then assessed using the honeycomb framework to understand their relevance in the context of social media usage owing to the lack of studies in the domain we developed multi-item table 1 seven social media building blocks kietzmann et al 2011  identity social media users reveal their identities to other users but every user differs in how much they reveal about themselves social media is designed for communication with other users the conversations may happen due to many reasons including building self-esteem and positioning oneself as a presenter of innovative ideas or trending information sharing social media is designed to share exchange distribute and receive content presence social media affordances include features to ascertain the availability and accessibility of other users social media provides opportunities for connectedness and this block represents the degree to which users are connected to other users social media users have a concern about how they are perceived by others reputation can be seen as a matter of trust groups social media groups represent the intrinsic need of users to be members of online social groups scales for this study hair et al 2010  the six-factor measurement model developed from the six measures generated during the qualitative study was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis cfa the proposed hypotheses were tested via structural equation modelling sem spss 25 and amos 25 were used to analyse the data related to all the items tajfel and turner 1986 proposed the social identity theory to explain why individuals instantaneously share news to create awareness among others they noted that being part of a group boosted the self-esteem of individuals as the groups provided a social identity and a sense of belonging to the social world to belong to a social network that is updated and well-informed is one of the main reasons that people strive to share information however the risk with instantaneous sharing of news is that it may inadvertently lead to dissemination of fake news relatively recent research finds that people tend to share fake news without authenticating it as they may believe it to be factual ie fake news resembles credible journalism hunt 2016  further scholars argue that fake news is made viral through social bots that spread it rapidly thus severely limiting the receivers fact-checking capacity jun et al 2017  in other words smp users may share news as they soon as receive it the sharing behaviour may be more pronounced with religious news in groups with known members as people exercise caution in expressing opinions on social media only in unfamiliar situations moe et al 2014  thus online social media groups with largely known members such as on whatsapp do not hinder the free expression of opinion further the socio-technical model of media effects marwick 2018 posits that users share fake news not only because they have been misled by partisan media but also because the fake news may align with their worldviews social positions and beliefs thus both time and religious factors may play a key role in the sharing of fake news on the basis of this discussion we hypothesise that ins positively correlates with lt and sr h2 ins has a positive association with lt the social distance corollary is another widely discussed aspect of tpe cohen et al 1988 mcleod et al 2001  according to the corollary people perceive that those who have a lower status than them or are at some distance from them physically or psychologically are more susceptible to negative messages on media and need to be protected the social distance corollary lays the ground for taking steps against the spread of fake news the need to protect those at a social distance from oneself may motivate individuals to take corrective action against the spread of fake news corrective action can be taken in different forms such as censorship of media xu and gonzenbach 2008 and online participation through public comments chung et al 2015  our qualitative study found that social media users engage in two types of corrective action ac and pc ac involves advising the sender of fake news to stop sharing and verify the authenticity before sharing as well as raising awareness about the fake news on the other hand pc involves reporting or blocking the social media user who sends fake news taking corrective action ac and pc is also in line with the propositions of tpp which hypothesises that social media users try to protect others from the unfavourable effects of fake news through their corrective action which may be positive eg advising or negative eg blocking smp users engaging in ac and pc are less likely to share such news due to lt and sr accordingly we propose the following hypotheses h3 ac has a negative association with sr h4 ac has a negative association with lt h5 pc has a negative association with sr h6 pc has a negative association with lt prior literature suggests that tpp has a self-enhancement bias gunther and mundy 1993 shen et al 2015  in an attempt to project a superior image guided by the self-enhancement bias smp users may tend to authenticate news before sharing they may do so to protect others with whom they make a downward comparison sun et al 2008  this authentication behaviour is also consistent with the fundamental concept of social exchange theory malinowski 1922  which propounds that individuals make decisions based on positive outcomes or long-term benefits thus individuals are likely to authenticate news before sharing as it may lead to positive outcomes such as earning the trust of members within their social groups and an improvement in their image the extant literature also considers trust as the most important variable influencing interpersonal dynamics and group behaviour golembiewski and mcconkie 1975  trust was also identified as important in other online contexts eg talwar et al 2020ab  thus trust may be seen as a key motivator for smp users to share authenticated information authenticating news before sharing can earn individuals social approval and enhance their reputation of being trustworthy users motivated by self-enhancement bias can be expected to be careful while sharing news therefore we hypothesise that the social media users who engage in an are less likely to share fake news due to lt and religiosity sr h7 an has a negative association with sr h8 an has a negative association with lt we mapped the seven dimensions of honeycomb framework to the themes derived from the qualitative study a fig 3  one or more of the seven dimensions helped anticipate the behaviour of smp users towards sharing of unauthenticated news for instance the conversation block table 2  captured the need of smp users to sustain conversations in the group by sharing rumours jokes wishes information and news thus the conversations on smps may be influenced by the need to entertain and gossip create awareness or simply share beliefs with social groups this behaviour has also been discussed previously eg katz et al 1974 okazaki et al 2013  such information-sharing behaviour provides the context for the themes derived from the qualitative study this block supports ins as one of the aspects of online news sharing it also explains why people may share fake news because of lt and sr information on how each measure is grounded in the building blocks is given in table 2  data for all items were found to be normally distributed since kurtosis and skewness were within the threshold limit of 1 the jarque and bera 1987 jarque bera test statistics confirmed continuous and multivariate normal distribution of variables next we checked for multicollinearity to avoid any increase in the standard error of loadings kock and lynn 2012 and found no related issues the variance inflation factor was below three and tolerance was greater than 01 to detect and control for common method bias which is a concern with self-reported surveys podsakoff et al 2003  we used both procedural and statistical approaches to this end all the questions in the questionnaire were close-ended responses were collected during face-to-face interactions and the confidentiality of responses was maintained harmans single factor test harman 1976 confirmed that common method bias was not a concern in the current study the composite reliability cr score of all the study measures was above 070 indicating sufficient internal reliability nunnally 1978  tables 3 and 4  the average variance extracted ave of the measures was above the cut-off value of 050 which confirmed their convergent validity fornell and larcker 1981  see tables 3 and 4  discriminant validity was ensured as the square root of ave was higher than the inter-construct correlations all the diagonal values were greater than the off-diagonal values in the same row and column and the correlation between any two study measures did not exceed 080 fornell and larcker 1981  the unidimensional nature of each measure was also confirmed since the item loadings for all the measures were above 060 as suggested by hair et al 2010 see table 5  further both the data sets returned satisfactory model fit indices kline 2016 table 6  both models a and b showed

active corrective action on fake news pcaf passive corrective action on fake news isnca instantaneous sharing of news for creating awareness anbs authenticating news before sharing sflt sharing fake news due to lack of time sfnr sharing fake news due to religiosity grounding the emerging themes the application of the honeycomb framework identity implies that users disclose information to project themselves in a certain way thus users can be expected to instantaneously share news on social media to create awareness ins as doing so may enhance their sense of belonging and shape their identities in certain ways implies that social media users can be expected to keep the conversation on the group going by sharing trending information sometimes with the purpose of creating awareness or at other times for the purpose of remaining active in the group thus this block supports the ins measure as one of the aspects of sharing information and news online it also explains why people may share fake news due to lack of time lt and religiosity sr sharing implies that members of social media groups are inclined to keep exchanging information with other users in their desire to keep sharing content users may not think of checking all the information they receive and may share it further without authentication in favour of speed and popularity thus this block can explain the behaviour related to sr and lt presence refers to the affordances of social media that allow users to know how accessible other users are this may gratify the social needs of users to connect with others and cause them to manifest sr and lt knowing that they have an available audience implies that since the identities of the group members are generally known it leads to more connectedness and results in the sharing of fake news or gossip knowingly or inadvertently further users can be expected to converse more freely in their known social groups as opposed to sharing information on sites that can be accessed by strangers as well thus they might manifest sr and lt reputation implies a concern for projecting a positive image that could motivate users to take corrective action against fake news circulating in their social network it also causes users to authenticate news before sharing it particularly news related to religion this explains the behaviour of active corrective action on fake news ac and passive corrective action on fake news pc this argument also justifies why authentication of news before sharing an is another aspect of the image-related utility behind the motivation to share factual information on online social media groups implies that in the quest to remain popular within the group social media users might share fake news both non-religious and religious it has been argued that fake news is also more sensational and sharing it might provide some kind of gratification eg entertainment thus this block serves as the basis for anticipating manifestations of sr and lt model b   010 p  005 in both models the results of the hypotheses testing are presented in table 7  age and gender are important variables in studies on social media usage eg abel et al 2016 kircaburun et al 2018  the use of control variables increases the robustness of study results gao and waechter 2017  in our research model we also controlled for age and gender the age variable influenced sharing of fake news due lt in both models  the results across both data sets supported the proposed positive association of ins with sr implying that users in social media groups share news instantaneously in accordance with tpe particularly if it is related to religion to create awareness among group members this result supports the findings of previous studies that opinions may be shared more freely in familiar situations like social groups eg moe et al 2014  it is also in line with the building blocks of relationship and sharing proposed in the honeycomb framework kietzmann et al 2011  it confirms the view that individuals believe and share any religion-related news they receive if it aligns with their views and beliefs as argued by the sociotechnical model of media effects marwick 2018  finally the finding also reinforces the tenets of tpe which suggest that individuals want their group members to know any religion-related news that they believe to be true the association of ins with lt was supported in both models this implies that users are likely to share all information and news coming their way on social media which may lead to the inadvertent sharing of fake news in other words people want to share more and more information with their group members as fast as possible and in the interests of speed they might also share fake news that seems true hunt 2016  this outcome is consistent with the tpe hypothesis the behaviour postulated by the social identity theory tajfel and turner 1986 and the interpretation of the building blocks of identities and conversations in the honeycomb framework kietzmann et al 2011  the relationship between ac with both sr and lt was hypothesised to suggest that social media users who are mindful of their reputation within their social group may adopt ac measures such as educating the senders of fake news on how to authenticate it both hypotheses were supported for model a this finding lends support to the social distance corollary of tpe davison 1983  which proposes that people act to protect others from harmful media messages as well as the social exchange theory malinowski 1922  which proposes that people like to make decisions that lead to positive perceptions within their social groups a positive outcome of taking corrective action is the possibility of greater trust that is social media users who make other users aware of the falsehood of a news item can succeed in earning their social groups trust the same can also be inferred from the reputation building block in the honeycomb framework kietzmann et al 2011  in the case of model b an association of ac with sr was not supported this may be linked to the location of sample collection data for model b was collected from a metropolitan city in india where the young generation is exposed to a more cosmopolitan culture they are unlikely to participate in religion-related discourse however this is a preliminary conclusion and more data are needed to verify it on the other hand support for the association of ac with lt in model b confirms that young users in metropolitan cities who take active corrective action against fake news are conscious of their responsibility to curtail the spread of fake news the proposed relationship between pc passive corrective action such as blocking senders of fake news with sr and with lt was not supported in model a this finding is in contrast with the behaviour anticipated according to the reputation building block of the honeycomb framework kietzmann et al 2011  the social exchange theory malinowski 1922 and prior research on the concept of trust this is possibly because this study focused on young whatsapp users who may note  measures developed based on a qualitative study be unwilling to take passive corrective action such as blocking the fake new sender as whatsapp groups typically comprise friends and acquaintances and blocking someone may attract inter-personal problems as well as backlash from other group members to draw more conclusive inferences future research should examine a similar hypothesis among other age groups of social media users interestingly the association between pc and sr was not supported in model b either however the association between pc and lt was supported which again highlights the importance of the sample location and should be explored in depth in future studies the support for the hypothesis implies that users who adopt pc measures are not likely to share fake news due to lt in consonance with the social exchange theory and the reputation building block of the honeycomb framework finally the hypotheses that users who authenticate any news before sharing it are likely not to share the fake news because of sr and lt were not supported by either model this result deviates from the reputation building block in the honeycomb framework kietzmann et al 2011 and the social distance corollary of tpe davison 1983  it is possible that social media users with a tendency to authenticate news are less prone to sharing news in general our findings are however consistent with a recent study by talwar et al 2019  who also found that authenticating news before sharing had no significant association with most explanatory variables like talwar et al 2019  we emphasise the need for more investigations on the relationship between authenticating news before sharing and other exploratory variables which take into account moderating influences this study explored the different manifestations related to fake-news sharing behaviour of smp users via two research questions to answer rq1 a qualitative study was conducted identifying the various behaviours related to sharing of unauthenticated news the process resulted in the development of six measures that included two forms of coping mechanisms ac and pc the other measures were ins an lt and sr as this is an exploratory study we specially developed scales for various measures and examined whether the behaviours in the qualitative study were in consonance with the results from prior studies accordingly we mapped the themes derived from the qualitative study to the honeycomb framework and found that the manifested behaviours were consistent with one or more building blocks of the honeycomb framework for instance the reputation block explained why users make efforts to take corrective action against the spread of fake news similarly the identity block clarified the motivation to share news instantaneously these linkages corroborate the findings of the qualitative study and lend credibility to the manifestations of sharing fake news to answer rq2 we explored the associations between different manifestations of fake-news sharing behaviour with the help of the tpe hypothesis the proposed research model was tested by applying sem to two different data sets collected from two different locations in india the results showed that ins had a positive relationship with sr and lt but an shared no association with sr or lt in both data sets the results also revealed that young users who took positive corrective action were unlikely to share fake news due to lt and sr further the path coefficients suggested that users age had a significant effect on sharing of fake news due to lt whereas gender had an effect on sharing fake news due to sr the current study and its findings have some key theoretical and practical implications for organisations brands service providers practitioners and researchers first the study extends the application of the honeycomb framework as well as the tpe theory beyond the traditional media to explain the phenomenon of fake news spread through smps the honeycomb framework is a popular theoretical lens widely used by practitioners and the scientific community while it has been mainly used to study social media use behaviour and social media ecology from an organisational perspective our study introduces a new dimension by applying it to fake news sharing similarly we have empirically tested and validated the applicability of seminal theories like tpe in the context of sharing of fake news on smps second our study makes a significant contribution to the current knowledge on sharing of fake news on smps by proposing and testing the validity of new and less-known measures instantaneous sharing of news online active and passive corrective action against fake-news sharing authenticating news before sharing and sharing of fake news due to lack of time and religiosity are measures that have not been explored before the developed measures can potentially help the scholarly community deepen the research on fake-news sharing behaviour which is currently at a nascent stage third these findings have uncovered new facets of fake-news sharing and smp use behaviour for instance the six behavioural manifestations of fake-news sharing along with the honeycomb framework suggest that the sharing behaviour associated with fake news is no different from general information sharing behaviour on smps smps offer a sense of social identity and belongingness which blurs the divide between what should be shared and what is not true thus it is likely that the sharing of fake news may not stem from malice but from a psychological need to keep groups informed and to remain connected this perhaps makes the menace of online fake news even more difficult to counter our study findings on corrective action and authentication of news before sharing suggest that social media affordances provide the basis for socially responsible behaviour as well positive outcomes such as earning the trust of social group members and enhancement of self-reputation can encourage users to engage in corrective action that will ultimately help in combating the fake news problem these revelations contribute to the theoretical knowledge in the domain fourth our study adopted a mixed-method approach which is fast becoming a tool for more robust analysis creswell 2013  in this context the study reinforces the usefulness of a mixed-method approach for grounded theory studies glaser and strauss 1967  further by testing the research model through multiple data sets collected from different locations the study opens the debate on whether locational factors influence the sharing of fake news within the same country finally this study focuses on smp users living in a developing country this in itself is a valuable contribution because of the dearth of studies on fake news in such regions by shifting the attention to developing countries we open the possibility of initiating future research in diverse geographies which can yield more globally relevant and authentic results this is especially useful given the growing use and penetration of social media in developing countries sharing of news without authentication especially if it is fake can have extremely damaging consequences for organisations and brands for instance poor reviews on smps can have severe implications for a brand or serve as a source of advertising particularly in an increasingly connected society characterised by the rising importance of customer engagement islam et al 2019a islam et al  2019b zhou and duan 2016  understanding the behaviour of users who share fake news without the appropriate corrective action can help marketers develop strategies to combat its spread for instance they can design communication that encourages individuals to take corrective action against the fake news they receive on social media and thus promote positive and relevant information about their brands second the negative association between ac and sr in our findings suggests that governments can formulate and spread messages that encourage social media users to undertake corrective behaviour this can go a long way in mitigating the spread of fake news especially related to religion or ethnicity which has become a grave concern globally note ac active corrective action on fake news pc passive corrective action on fake news ins instantaneous sharing of news for creating awareness an authenticating news before sharing lt sharing fake news due to lack of time sr sharing fake news due to religiosity third our results show a positive association of ins with sr and lt respectively this indicates that news-sharing instincts push people to forward news items instantaneously this supports the need for regulatory control of smps to some extent particularly during a crisis such as the covid-19 global pandemic  who 2020 wherein fake news spread can induce fear and panic among the public this poses an enormous challenge especially because fake news items may resemble credible journalism hunt 2016  causing people to believe them and act accordingly finally our study results suggest that social media users share news and information to gratify their social needs earlier studies have also discussed the gratifications associated with smp use among various age groups dhir et al 2017 dhir et al  2018  users social stature and reputation in online social groups can improve significantly if they establish their identities as those who take corrective action against the circulation of fake news regulators brands service providers and organisations could benefit from these findings and utilise them to stem the spread of fake news despite the use of a mixed-method design approach with a large sample size the study suffers from the limitations associated with any cross-sectional study that is based on self-reported information including various methodological biases and lack of information on causality future studies could address this limitation by adopting longitudinal and experimental research designs second our samples consisted of young social media users living in india this imposes some restrictions on the generalisability of the findings it would be interesting to replicate these investigations among social media users of other age groups and from different geographies third we mainly focused on six behavioural manifestations related to fake-news sharing behaviour however exploring other interesting aspects related to fake-news sharing on smps such as gossip-sharing behaviour fear of missing out social media fatigue and the dark side of social media use could offer interesting insights lastly we have not tested the moderating influences of educational background income or other variables that could have provided more granular results studies undertaken in future should identify and investigate moderating variables in order to highlight individual differences in fake-news sharing behaviour despite these limitations however this study makes a significant contribution to the emerging research domain of fake-news sharing behaviour  the role of transmembrane protein 27 tmem27 in islet physiology and its potential use as a beta cell mass biomarker j altirriba r gasa s casas m ramrez-bajo j s ros a gutierrez-dalmau m ruiz de villa c a barbera r gomis   type 2 diabetes is a complex disease that presents beta cell failure in the setting of insulin resistance at the beginning of the disease pancreatic beta cells adapt to insulin resistance by increasing their mass and secretory function nevertheless the sustained hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia eventually exert a negative impact on beta cell function and lead to impaired insulin secretion and decreased insulin gene expression ultimately causing beta cell apoptosis 1 2 moreover the follow-up of beta cell mass in diabetic patients and in people strongly at risk for diabetes and their response to pharmacological treatment may be crucial for early diagnosis and treatment selection making the search for beta cell mass markers a high priority for investigation 3 transmembrane protein 27 tmem27 was first described in the kidney as an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 homologue involved in amino acid transport 4 5 in the pancreas tmem27 is produced in beta cells 6 7 however its biological role in this cell type remains uncertain while one study established a potential positive role of tmem27 in glucose-stimulated insulin exocytosis 7 another study linked tmem27 production to beta cell proliferation 6 the latter study also hypothesised that tmem27 which is cleaved and shed into the extracellular space might be used as a beta cell mass biomarker furthermore adding to the controversy concerning the physiological role of tmem27 in beta cell homeostasis tmem27-knockout mice exhibited both normal insulin secretion and beta cell mass and replication 8 in spite of the lack of consensus on the function of tmem27 in beta cells its suggested roles in cellular proliferation and insulin secretion together with its potential use as a beta cell mass biomarker make it an interesting candidate factor in type 2 diabetes that deserves further characterisation in this study we characterised tmem27 production in human pancreatic islets confirming that it is mainly produced in beta cells importantly we report that tmem27 expression is decreased in type 2 diabetic islets in addition using gene expression analysis in human and rat islets along with gain-of-function experiments in a pancreatic beta cell line and isolated islets we provide evidence that tmem27 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion with little if any control of proliferation finally we show that tmem27 is cleaved not only by beta cells but also by kidney tubular cells a finding that rules it out as a beta cell mass biomarker pancreases were obtained from 11 human cadaver organ donors eight

a tukeys post-hoc test longitudinal data esm fig 2ac were analysed as set out in the esm for correlation analysis spearmans rank correlation coefficient  and the associated p value were calculated using r language 24 tmem27 immunolocalisation studies performed in human pancreas found that tmem27 production is restricted to islets mainly in beta cells fig 1a esm fig 3 and esm fig 4 because of the roles reported for tmem27 in insulin secretion and beta cell replication 6 7 we wondered whether tmem27 expression and immunolocalisation were affected in diabetic patients we determined tmem27 gene expression by real-time pcr in isolated human islets from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic donors and found that tmem27 mrna levels were significantly diminished in type 2 diabetic islets compared with controls healthy islets 100  026 diabetic islets 035  015 arbitrary units n  83 respectively p  005 on the other hand no differences in the pancreatic localisation of tmem27 were observed in diabetic donors tmem27 was produced in insulin-positive cells as described for healthy donors fig 1

 in order to define the possible role of tmem27 in human islets we aimed to establish the correlation between tmem27 expression and the expression of several genes implicated in insulin secretion and proliferation we observed a significant positive correlation between tmem27 and insulin fig 2a in addition tmem27 positively correlated with snapin fig 2b which encodes a protein related to the soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare complex with which tmem27 has been shown to interact 7 as expected insulin correlated with snapin esm fig 5 in contrast we found no significant correlation between tmem27 and any of the cell cycle genes studied namely cyclin e1 cdk2 cyclin d1 and cdk6 fig 2cf

 to further investigate the relative contribution of tmem27 to insulin secretion regulation as opposed to cell proliferation control we studied tmem27 expression in islets of wistar rats treated with sodium tungstate 10 25 this treatment improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance esm fig 2ac lowers basal insulinaemia fig 3a and decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion fig 3b pancreatic islets from tungstate-treated rats present a higher ratio of pcna-positive cells fig 3c which is indicative of enhanced proliferation therefore tungstate treatment elicits decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increases islet proliferation making these animals an interesting model for the analysis of the potential implication of tmem27 in these two cellular functions in islets from tungstate-treated rats we found that despite the increase observed in beta cell proliferation tmem27 mrna levels were decreased in parallel to those of insulin with a significant correlation between tmem27 and insulin gene expression fig 3df as we observed previously in human islets

 tmem27 protein is highly homologous among rats mice and humans fig 4a interestingly when performing immunoblots using islet protein extracts from these species we noticed different band patterns esm fig 6a which might indicate the existence of inter-specific differences in the processing andor post-translational modifications of the tmem27 protein one possible explanation for this observation was that tmem27 was produced in different endocrine subtypes within the islets however immunofluorescence analysis revealed that tmem27 production was mainly localised to beta cells in all three species esm fig 7 next to establish the importance of the primary sequence of tmem27 we adenovirally expressed rat mouse and human tmem27tmem27 cdna in rat ins-1 cells esm fig 6b here again we found characteristic band patterns for each isoform suggesting that the differences observed were more probably due to the amino acid sequence of tmem27 than to the presence of specific modifying or processing enzymes

 we wondered if these discrepancies had an impact on the biological function of the different tmem27 isoforms we therefore studied the effects of overexpressing rat mouse and human tmem27tmem27 on insulin secretion and proliferation in ins-1 cells all three proteins elicited an increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and a slight increase in proliferation fig 4b c which was not accompanied by an increase in cell number fig 4d so the different orthologues appeared to exert similar effects when overexpressed in the same cellular context finally in order to rule out a possible artefact from the beta cell line we tested the effect of overexpressed rat tmem27 in isolated rat pancreatic islets and demonstrated as in ins-1 cells a significant enhancement in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with no changes in proliferation levels fig 5 altogether our data indicate that tmem27 irrespective of the species of origin is mainly involved in insulin secretion

 in view of the finding that tmem27 is exclusively cleaved and shed into the extracellular space in beta cells the extracellular fraction of tmem27 was proposed as a possible beta cell mass biomarker 6 here we investigated the cleavage pattern of tmem27 in beta cells and kidney tubular cells with or without overproduction of rat tmem27 which harbours a c-terminal myc tag for this purpose we used two different antibodies 1 a myc tag antibody which recognises the complete protein and the c-terminal fragment that remains anchored to the membrane after cleavage and 2 an antibody against the n-terminal of the protein 6 which recognises both the complete protein and the fragment that is released into the extracellular space after cleavage fig 6a as shown in fig 6b 16 h after adenoviral infection of ins-1 cells overproduced myc-tagged tmem27 was detected as two different molecular mass bands with anti-myc antibodies an additional lower molecular mass band 20 kda appeared 4 h later probably corresponding to the previously described fragment of tmem27 6 which remains anchored to the membrane after the cleavage as it did not change after glycosidase treatment esm fig 8a and it has a lower apparent molecular mass than the expected size of the complete protein without modifications 27 kda phosphorylation and the presence of sulphated glycans were also tested and yielded negative results esm fig 8

 next we studied tmem27 processing in islets and primary proximal kidney tubular cells our results demonstrate that the smallest band detected with the myc antibody is present in ins-1 islets and proximal tubular cells fig 6c in addition we detected the extracellular portion of tmem27 25 kda which has been cleaved and shed in the culture media of uninfected and infected ins-1 and proximal tubular cells fig 6d this fragment can be deglycosylated esm fig 9 thus confirming that it corresponds to the released fragment of tmem27 as previously described 6 therefore our results show that the cleavage of tmem27 is not beta cell specific and consequently cannot be used as a beta cell mass biomarker in this study we confirm that human tmem27 pancreatic expression is restricted to islets and is mainly localised in beta cells importantly we show that tmem27 mrna levels are significantly reduced in islets from type 2 diabetic patients this finding is in accordance with available whole-genome profiling data that show tmem27 as one of the 370 genes differentially expressed between diabetic and control human islets 26 in the same line a recent report shows that tmem27 expression is tenfold lower in islets from recent diagnosed type 1 diabetic pancreatic donors as compared with healthy controls 27 taken together these data point to tmem27 as a potentially important protein for consideration in beta cell physiology and diabetes in humans studies in rodents have also shown alterations in the expression of tmem27 in animals with altered glucose homeostasis andor diabetes for instance tmem27 is downregulated in models with islet hypoplasia and hypoinsulinaemia such as hnf-1-knockout and transgenic mice overexpressing a human dominant-negative form of hnf-1 p291fsinsc-hnf-1 7 whereas it is upregulated in models with islet hypertrophia and hyperinsulinaemia such as obob dbdb ap2-srebp-1c kkay or high-fat-diet obese mice 6 7 though all these data might be interpreted as indicative of the existence of a link between tmem27 expression and beta cell dysfunction the truth is that the role of tmem27 in the physiology of the pancreatic beta cell is still a matter of controversy one study points towards its implication in insulin secretion as a component of the snare complex 7 while another indicates that it is mainly involved in beta cell replication 6 furthermore another recent study reports that tmem27-knockout mice do not display any prominent pancreatic phenotype 8 to shed some light on the relative contribution of tmem27 to the regulation of insulin secretion and proliferation in beta cells we investigated the correlations between tmem27 expression and genes implicated in insulin secretion and proliferation in human pancreatic islets in fact we found a significant and positive correlation with insulin and snapin but not with cyclins e1 and d1 cdk2 or cdk6 which suggests that tmem27 expression is more directly correlated to changes in insulin secretion than to beta cell proliferation while interpretation of these data has obvious limitations as these studies are restricted to the key regulators of the cell cycle 28 and we cannot rule out the existence of correlations at the level of protein expression we reached a similar conclusion when we used an experimental rat model based on tungstate treatment 10 25 this model offers us the possibility to assess tmem27 expression in a scenario of increased beta cell proliferation and diminished insulin secretion which is substantially different from the models mentioned above in which both secretory and proliferative activities were affected in a similar manner in tungstate-treated rats we found downregulation of islet tmem27 expression thus altogether our expression data in humans and rats favour a role of tmem27 in insulin secretion rather than cell proliferation as the above expression data cannot provide a clear-cut answer regarding the biological function of tmem27 in beta cells we undertook an in vitro gain-of-function approach and adenovirally expressed tmem27tmem27 in ins-1 cells because previous studies overexpressing either mouse tmem27 6 or human tmem27 7 in insulinoma cells and transgenic mice had reached different conclusions we wondered whether different tmem27 isoforms were responsible for the discrepancies in fact our preliminary observation that rat mouse and human tmem27 proteins showed different band patterns in immunoblot analysis not only in protein extracts from isolated islets but also when overproduced in ins-1 cells provided support for the hypothesis that inter-specific variations in the post-translational modifications andor processing of tmem27 proteins might account for the reported differences in function nevertheless our data show strikingly similar results when these three isoforms are overexpressed in ins-1 cells a significant enhancement in glucose-induced insulin secretion with a very modest increase in proliferation which was not reflected in measurable increases in cell number likewise overproduction of the rat isoform in isolated rat islets resulted in modifications in insulin secretion but not in proliferation rates in summary the expression data and our gain-of-function studies point to a role for tmem27 in insulin secretion but little if any contribution to beta cell proliferation currently there are no reliable methods for measuring beta cell mass in living humans for this reason most studies are performed in cadaver donors as the risks of pancreas biopsies outweigh the benefits of research however the monitoring of beta cell mass in association with insulin secretion could be extremely useful for describing and predicting the dynamics of beta cell loss and very importantly may improve the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus 29 30 tmem27 was reported to be cleaved and shed in a constitutive way into the extracellular compartment only by pancreatic beta cells because of this reported beta cell specificity akpinar et al 6 proposed that the quantification of this protein in serum might be used as an indirect measure of beta cell mass and thus it would have a role as a beta cell biomarker while our study confirms that tmem27 is cleaved and secreted into the extracellular space by beta cells it also shows that this ability is shared by primary kidney proximal tubular cells in which tmem27 was identified and its role in amino acid transport demonstrated 5 this finding thus challenges the results reported by akpinar et al 6 a possible explanation for this inconsistency might be the use of primary cultures in our study whereas akpinar et al 6 used immortalised cell lines our data suggest that circulating tmem27 in serum can have at least two different origins pancreatic beta cells and kidney proximal tubular cells we therefore conclude that the extracellular fraction of tmem27 cannot be reliably used as a beta cell mass biomarker  actual concepts in rhinosinusitis a review of clinical presentations inflammatory pathways cytokine profiles remodeling and management philippe eloy anne poirrier lise clotilde de dorlodot thibaut van zele jean watelet baptiste bernard bertrand   rhinosinusitis is a large and heterogeneous group of diseases despite the fact that many papers have been published on this topic in the past decade little is known about the etiology and pathophysiology nevertheless the amount of knowledge available in the worldwide literature has changed our understanding of this entity rhinosinusitis is commonly classified into acute ars and chronic rhinosinusitis crs based on symptom duration in ars an inflammatory reaction characterizes most uncomplicated mild to moderate cases therefore there is no longer an argument to prescribe an antibiotic as the first line of treatment but rather to privilege an anti-inflammatory treatment such as intranasal steroids in severe and complicated cases antibiotics combined with topical steroids should remain the treatment of choice on the other hand crs is actually subdivided into two distinct entities crs with and without polyps as growing evidence indicates that these entities have specific inflammatory pathways and cytokine profiles this paper is a review of the recent data on rhinosinusitis the authors hope that this review helps clinicians gain a better understanding of how to manage such conditions rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous group of diseases a significant and increasing health problem that affects about 15 of the population in western countries 1 2 it has a substantial impact on patients health-related quality of life and daily functioning it represents a huge financial burden for society and the health care system as a result of direct and indirect costs this establishes rhinosinusitis as one of the most expensive disorders experienced by for example the us population 24 on the basis of the international consensus on rhinosinusitis rhinosinusitis is subdivided into acute subacute recurrent and chronic rhinosinusitis table 1 summarizes the different forms of rhinosinusitis

 ars is a common upper respiratory tract disorder that involves inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa it can be mild moderate or severe unlike a common cold which typically resolves in less than 5 days the symptomatology of ars worsens after 5 days or persists more than 10 days but in all cases it resolves in less than 4 weeks 5 6 in the european position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps document the symptoms can persist up to 12 weeks and be intermittent or persistent 1 primary care physicians diagnose and treat a large proportion of these infections with appropriate therapy signs and symptoms of ars resolve completely the diagnosis of ars is based on patient history and clinical examination 6 the symptomatology includes nasal congestion purulent discharge fever headache facial painpressure dental pain postnasal drip cough and tenderness around the sinus area 5 6 table 2 summarizes the symptomatology and classifies it into major and minor symptoms and those found in the cases of complications the symptoms typically worsen in the recumbent position and may interfere with sleep

 nasal endoscopy reveals the mucosa and turbinates to be red and swollen with clear secretions that turn thicker colored and opaque within 57 days and then become clear again before symptom resolution symptoms that require immediate referral to a specialist are the following periorbital edema displacement of the eyeball diplopia ophthalmoplegia impaired extraocular movements reduced visual acuity severe headache or unilateral facial or orbital pain frontal lump and neurological signs and deficits ars is typically preceeded by a viral infection or an allergic reaction viruses account for at least 80 to 90 of the causative agents of ars among them rhinovirus coronavirus influenza respiratory syncitial virus and parainfluenza virus play a major role 79 ars becomes a bacterial infection in about 05 to 2 of the cases this is the case when the rs is severe or complicated in these particular conditions the infernal trio streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarhalis infections must be considered anaerobes have been reported in up to 30 of cases the pathophysiology of ars involves interaction between a predisposing condition allergic rhinitis septal deformity immune deficiency environmental factors a viral infection and a consequent inflammatory response in the mucosal lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses table 3 summarizes different predisposing factors that can play a role in the development of ars the inflammatory process leads to the development of edema engorgement fluid extravasation mucus production and obstruction of the sinus ostium this ostial obstruction impedes the normal ventilation and drainage of the sinus there is then a decrease in the partial pressure in oxygen a decrease in the ciliary clearance a stasis of secretion and a secundary bacterial infection thus ars is first regarded as an infectious process initiated by a viral infection

 when we consider the cytokine profile ars results from a t-helper type 1 th1 cytokine polarization associated with a high level of tumor necrosis factor- and interferon- there is also release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-1 il-6 and il-8 these cytokines are considered very potent chemoattractive agents for neutrophils figure 1 is a schematic of the inflammatory cascade in the case of a rhinovirus infection

 the goals of treatment of ars are to alleviate or minimize symptoms eradicate pathogens and the underlying cause with therapies that halt inflammation and promote sinus drainage it is interesting to point out that 65 of ars cases resolve spontaneously within 2 weeks 6 table 4 summarizes the different treatment options in cases of ars in the early phase of ars symptomatic treatment is sufficient it consists of nasal douches decongestants exspectorants mucolytics and painkillers in moderate ars monotherapy with an intranasal glucosteroid is recommended 5 6 10

 glucocorticoids act on the glucocorticoid receptor to inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators which are upregulated during the inflammatory response as a consequence they reduce the mucosal inflammation edema cellular infiltration and nasal congestion improve the permeability of the sinus ostium and thus facilitate the ventilation and drainage of the sinus by reducing the eosinophilia they can also be of great help in cases of comorbid allergic rhinitis which occurs frequently in young patients and is a possible predisposing factor for the development of ars treatment with intranasal steroids ins has proven to be safe and well-tolerated with an incidence of adverse events no greater than those observed with placebo in moderate to severe cases topical steroids must be used in association with a broad spectrum antibiotic 1113 many studies including randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of such a combination actually it provides greater symptomatic improvement than antibiotic therapy alone shorter time to recovery and greater regression of imaging abnormalities 12 13 the antibiotic is chosen acccording to the local bacterial resistance patterns effectiveness and safety it must be effective against s pneumoniae and h influenzae which are the most common bacteria implicated in uncomplicated community-acquired acute bacterial rhinosinusitis that is why in the united states the first choice is amoxycillin 9 14 15 it is also clear that the use of antibiotics is warranted in patients with severe or rapidly worsening symptoms regardless of the duration of illness and that referral to an ear nose and throat specialist is mandatory in such cases nasal polyposis is a subgroup of crs it remains one of the most difficult challenges in otolaryngology as its etiology and pathophysiology are still unclear medical treatment is unsatisfactory and because of frequent recurrences repeated surgical procedures are often necessary nasal polyps present as edematous semitranslucent masses originating from the mucosal linings of the sinuses and prolapsing into the nasal cavities nasal endoscopy shows them to be bilateral they are lateral to the middle turbinates in the middle meatus and are frequently present in the superior meatus when the polyposis is unilateral another diagnosis must be considered eg a schneiderian papilloma or a tumor in adults or a dermoid cyst meningoencephalocele or nasal glioma in children the symptomatology is similar to that of crs without polyps table 5 with frequent nasal congestion anterior and posterior nasal discharge and recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infection reduction or loss of the sense of smell is a very important symptom in patients with nasal polyps headache and facial painpressure are less common than in crs without polyps concerning the bacteriology all the organisms described in the section chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps can infect a nasal polyposis the infernal trio can be associated with recurrence of the polyposis during an acute bacterial exacerbation of sinusitis antibiotic-resistant organisms biofilms and osteitis also can be associated with the polyposis a specific item to discuss in case of nasal polyposis is the role of bacterial colonization by s aureusproducing enterotoxins 31 8587 enterotoxins from s aureus act locally as superantigens on t lymphocytes and induce a multiclonal b-cell activation release of cytokines il-5 from th2 cells results in an eosinophilic activation with release of eosinophilic cationic protein ecp ecp causes tissue damage edema formation and albumin accumulation b-cell activation will result in the production of multiclonal ige by plasma in contrast in patients with crs without polyps there is no evidence of increased prevalence of enterotoxin-specific ige antibodies figure 4 shows the possible role of enterotoxins producing s aureus in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps

 nasal polyposis constitutes a heterogeneous group of diseases based on the type of inflammatory infiltrate we can subdivide the nasal polyps into two groups eosinophilic and neutrophilic table 9 lists the different subpopulations of nasal polyps

 nasal polyposis affects about 4 of the general population in western countries it is not more common in atopic individuals than in healthy controls it is interesting to note that 29 of the belgian population is sensitized to at least one aeroallergen 88 more than 40 of nasal polyposis is associated with nonallergic asthma about 25 of nasal polyposis is associated with aspirin sensitivity samters triad aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease represents a subset of patients with severe recalcitrant nasal polyposis and asthma in the setting of aspirin sensitivity the underlying pathophysiology appears to be dysregulation in the eicosanoid metabolism pathway leading to increased production of cysteinyl leukotrienes and decreased levels of prostaglandins churg-strauss syndrome or allergic granulomatous angiitis is characterized by inflammation of the small arteries and veins in individuals with a history of asthma or allergy besides inflammation of the blood vessels there is also an increase in the number of eosinophils and inflammatory nodular lesions nasal polyps are present in about 50 of patients afs is associated with nasal polyposis in more than 80 of cases histologically polyps are covered by respiratory pseudostratified columnar epithelium with some areas of squamous metaplasia there is frequent epithelial damage epithelium shedding and variable stages of thickened basement membrane pseudocyst formation and edema are two major characteristics of nasal polyps these pseudocysts contain albumin and other plasma proteins the number of vessels and glands is reduced and there is virtually no neuronal structure fibroblasts and infiltrating inflammatory cells are localized around pseudocyst formations eg2 activated eosinophils are usually located around vessels and glands and are predominant in about 80 of patients with nasal polyps the number of degranulating epithelial mast cells is high 51 53 55 89 in nasal polyps the ecm is severely damaged this can be explained by the fact that the balance between mmps and tissue inhibitors of mmps has been shown to be displaced in favour of mmps especially mmp-9 and mmp-7 56 it also has been demonstrated that there are modifications in the angiogenesis in nasal polyps via the vascular endothelial growth factor 90 the vascular endothelial growth factor plays a role in inducing edema angiogenesis and fibrosis it was demonstrated that it is intensively expressed in nasal polyps mainly in inflammatory cells but also in epithelial cells tgf-1 upregulates its secretion nasal polyposis in caucasian patients has a predominantly th2-biased eosinophilic inflammation table 7 17 18 20 23 57 58 9193 this is associated with high levels of il-5 rantes regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and eotaxin that play a role in the recruitment and activation of eosinophils and decrease their apoptosis 9496 concentrations in ecps are high there is an upregulation of cysteinyl-leukotriene synthesis but no significant differences in polyps were found between patients with and without samters triad and asthma this can explain some benefit observed with a treatment with anti-leukotriene modifiers in nasal polyposis 97 there is a decrease in foxp3 expression accompanied by upregulation of tbet and gata-binding protein 3 and a downregulation of tgf-1 57 after treatment with ins foxp3 expression is increased 58 elevated levels of total and specific ige in the polyp tissue are another major characteristic in nasal polyposis their concentrations may be very high 1000 kul but are often unrelated to serum ige levels and to skin prick test positivity which is in contrast to allergic rhinitis the production is very heterogeneous bachert et al 31 91 98 99 demonstrated three different categories of patients nasal polyposis group 1 demonstrated no measurable specific ige nasal polyposis group 2 selected specific ige and the third group demonstrated a multiclonal specific ige including ige to s aureus enterotoxins a high total ige level and a high prevalence of asthma in this latter group patients are usually sensitized to aspirin 31 91 98 99 before considering the treatment it is interesting to note that chinese patients have neutrophilic and not eosinophilic polyps such polyps are also seen in inherited diseases such as primary ciliary diskinesia and cystic fibrosis chinese patients with polyps are characterized by b- and t-cell activation a minor eosinophilic inflammation compared with polyps from white individuals and a decrease in tgf-1 in comparison with controls one third of patients with polyps showed an ige response to s aureus enterotoxins 100 figure 5 shows the putative mechanisms cells and mediators implied in crs with polyps and chinese polyps

 the management of nasal polyps is extremely individual and must be discussed case by case as the expectations of one patient are not necessary the same as those of others the treatment can be medical and surgical 101 102 the goals of treatment are to re-establish the nasal airway and nasal breathing minimize symptoms improve the sense of smell treat co-existing diseases such as asthma improve quality of life and prevent complications 103 before starting any therapy it is important to inform patients that nasal polyposis is a chronic sinus disease that is impossible to cure but that we can potentially stabilize it with different medications recurrence is the rule but observance of compliance with the treatment can postpone for as long as possible the relapse of the disease in samters triad it is important to avoid definitively any form of acetylsalicylic acid and nsaids corticosteroids are the first-choice treatment approach for an eosinophilic polyposis as they can suppress many phases of the inflammatory process for example they inhibit the liberation of vasoactive mediators reducing vasodilatation fluid extravasation edema and local deposit of mediators they also reduce recruitment of inflammatory cells fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins systemic application affects all polyp tissue within the nose and sinuses but has the disadvantage of systemic adverse effects when used for long-term treatment hissaria et al 104 demonstrated with a randomized placebo-controlled trial the efficacy of a 14-day course of 50 mg of prednisolone on patients symptoms quality of life and endoscopic score nevertheless from a clinical point of view some patients may experience a rebound effect after a course of systemic corticosteroids 104106 topical application of corticosteroids dramatically reduces the risk of systemic side effects 107 many studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ins in nasal polyposis even if the intrasinus portion of the polyps is not reachable with a nasal spray 108112 among all the specialities mometasone furoate and fluticasone furoate are the newest and safest molecules with the lowest bioavailability in nasal polyposis antibiotics at full dose are recommended to treat acute bacterial exacerbation of sinusitis but in recent years considerable evidence has emerged to suggest that macrolide antibiotics at low dose could play a role in the treatment of nasal polyposis 113120 macrolides have immunomodulatory properties in addition to their well-established antimicrobial activity indeed macrolide antibiotics inhibit synthesis andor secretion of proinflammatory cytkines il-5 il-8 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor tgf- il-6 il-8 tumor necrosis factor they have many effects on neutrophils they decrease the neutrophil oxidative burst inhibit neutrophil migration to inflammatory sites increase the apoptosis of the neutrophils and inhibit the neutrophil adhesion they also decrease the eosinophilic inflammation reduce the goblet cell secretion and decrease bronchoconstriction all the studies confirm clinical efficacy with a significant reduction in the size of the polyps and reduction in symptoms nasal obstruction nasal discharge purulence headache and the relapse of the polyps seems to be delayed however all the studies demonstrated the necessity of long-term use 312 months and the slow onset after 2 weeks of treatment only 5 of patients indicated improvement while after 4 weeks 48 were improved after 8 weeks 63 were improved and after 12 weeks 71 were improved when we consider such a long-term treatment gastrointestinal intolerance can be a problem for the observance of the treatment moreover at low dose emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria should be taken into consideration antihistamines are typically one of the medications of choice to treat allergic rhinitis despite several theoretical pharmacologic properties applicable for the treatment of nasal polyposis consensus group on new-generation antihistmaines conga 121 little has been published about such an indication 122127 anti-leukotrienes have shown some effects on nasal polyposis 128 129 changes in the arachidonic acid metabolism have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis especially in aspirin-sensitive individuals and cysteinyl leukotrienes have been found in increased levels in nasal tissue from those patients whereas concentrations of prostaglandin e2 were decreased furthermore the leukotriene c4 synthase was found to be upregulated in patients with nasal polyps as were as the number of leukocytes expressing the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor as compared with their nonaspirin-sensitive counterparts thus the use of leukotrienes antagonists especially in aspirin-sensitive nasal polyp patients seems appropriate however large-scale controlled trials in clearly characterized patientswith or without aspirin sensitivityare lacking thus far in patients with aspirin sensitivity aspirin desensitization can be recommended 130 131 aspirin desensitization consists of administering incremental oral doses to reach a maintenance dose of greater than 650 mgd then inducing a refractory period of a few days continuous treatment over years may lead to a significant reduction in number of sinus infections per year improvement in olfaction and a reduction in use of systemic corticosteroids treatment with daily aspirin may be a therapeutic option for patients who do not respond to topical and systemic corticosteroids as new treatment options we must consider doxycycline antiil-5 and anti-ige doxycycline is an antibiotic that also inhibits the synthesis of mmps and mmp-9 activity in vitro however doxycycline does not affect the mmp-9 inhibitors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 132 a double-blind placebo-controlled study demonstrated in 32 patients a significant decrease in the endoscopic nasal polyp score 412 weeks after the start of the doxycline treatment compared with placebo the concentrations of ige myeloperoxidase mmp-9 and ecp decreased significantly in nasal secretions of doxycycline-treated patients in a clinical setting the use of doxycycline offers an additional advantage of providing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects resulting in a decrease in nasal polyp size 133 as il-5 is increased in polyp tissue and related to eosinophilic inflammation and antiil-5 monoclonal antibody treatment in vitro induced eosinophil apoptosis this cytokine was a reasonable target for antibody therapy in nasal polyps different humanized antiil-5 monoclonal antibodies have been developed and studied in asthma and a pilot study in nasal polyposis has provided promising results 134 135 considering the marked local production of ige antibodies in nasal polyps and their relation to severity of disease it appears that local ige is functional and involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation thus strategies to antagonize ige could be relevant treatment of allergic asthma and rhinitis with omalizumab a humanized anti-ige monoclonal antibody causes a marked reduction in circulating free ige levels no studies in nasal polyposis have been published however at least two teams have already thought about possible clinical applications of anti-ige in severe nasal polyposis regardless of whether it is associated with corticodependent asthma 85 136 the management of nasal polyposis usually involves medical treatment and frequently surgery as an adjunct to the medical treatment surgical removal of nasal polyps is indicated for patients not responding adequately to medical management those with continued or recurrent infections as well as patients who are developing mucoceles or other complications of sinusitis patients with polyps and asthma may benefit from surgery by reduction of one trigger of asthma the type of surgery to perform is the subject of debate in europe what is the respective place of endoscopic-guided polypectomy versus functional endoscopic sinus surgery versus nasalization as recommended by dr jankowski from nancy is functional endoscopic sinus surgery still the gold standard must we open all the ethmoid compartments must we clear the frontal recess completely must we do a large sphenoidotomy in all cases all these questions remain unanswered as long as a complete ethmoidectomy is recommended powered instrumentation with microdebrider appears particularly helpful in extensive polyposis 137140 it allows a precise removal of the polyps under a good visual control with preservation of the anatomy it minimizes mucosal trauma and stripping and guarantees minimal crust formation a rapid mucosal healing and a low incidence of synechiae formation in revision surgery because the anatomy can be highly distorted but even in huge polyposis the surgery can be conducted with a navigation system 141143 this gives the surgeon more confidence particularly for the frontal sinus area and the sphenoid sinus and seems to reduce the rate of complication endoscopic sinus surgery has been shown to lead to significant improvement in total nasal resistance as measured with rhinomanometry in nasal volume as measured by acoustic rhinometry in ciliary beat frequency in mucociliary clearance as measured by saccharin test and in olfaction as measured by university of pennsylvania smell identification test increasing evidence also indicates that management of polyposis has a benefit for the lower airway and for the patients health-related quality of life 80 82 83 144153 however surgery as complete as it can be is not the final and definitive step to treat a nasal polyposis that remains as long as we know a chronic inflammatory disease whose etiology and pathophysiology are still poorly understood long-term treatment with topical steroids after surgery remains a rule for eosinophilic polyps to reduce the incidence of polyp recurrences or prolong the symptom-free time interval 154156 rhinosinusitis represents a very large and heterogeneous group of diseases ars is mainly an inflammatory disorder initiated by a viral infection ins seem to be the best first option for treatment of mild to moderate cases crs without polyps is a mainly a neutrophilic inflammation antibiotics combined with ins is the first choice of treatment but functional sinus surgery is usually necessary to improve the patient crs with polyps is the most frustrating disease for clinicians as recurrences are the rule asthma and aspirin intolerance are the most common comorbidities in caucasian patients it is associated with an eosinophilic infiltration fungi or s aureus enterotoxins could play a role in the pathophysiology glucocorticoids associated with large sinus surgery were for a long time the only treatment but new treatment options seem promising specifically doxycycline antiil-5 or anti-ige   geoffrey dube k s husain ali kasi mccune r p sandoval rodrigo lloyd ratner e david cohen j  word count 64 word count 2062 abstract coronavirus disease 2019 has become a pandemic since first being described in january 2020 clinical manifestations in non-transplant patients range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome multiorgan system failure and death limited reports in kidney transplant recipients suggest similar characteristics in that population we report here the first case series of covid-19 infection occurring in pancreas transplant recipients  sars-cov-2 a novel coronavirus first reported in december 2019 rapidly developed into a global pandemic with more than 18 million cases and 100000 deaths reported worldwide 1 clinical manifestations of covid-19 the disease caused by sars-cov-2 range from asymptomatic infection to mild upper respiratory tract symptoms or viral pneumonia the most severe cases of covid-19 can lead to respiratory failure multiorgan system failure and death 2 3 mortality rates between 2-3 have been reported in the general population 4 death is more common in those with preexisting conditions including hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease 4 due to chronic immunosuppression transplant recipients are at increased risk both of acquiring infections and developing more severe clinical disease additionally there is a high burden of comorbid disease in the transplant population several case reports and single-center series have described covid-19 in transplant patients with most series describing kidney transplant patients who were sick enough to require hospitalization 5 6 7 8 9 to date there have been no reports of covid-19 in pancreas transplant pt recipients we report here our experience with covid-19 disease in four pt recipients in new york the epicenter of the outbreak in the united states four simultaneous pancreas-kidney spk transplant recipients representing 43 of all patients with functioning pt followed by our program were diagnosed with covid-19 disease between march 22 2020 and april 11 2020 three patients tested positive by nasopharyngeal swab for sars-c0v-2 after presenting to the hospital for evaluation the fourth patient received a clinical diagnosis of covid-19 based on symptoms due to a critical shortage of testing supplies during the epidemic outpatient confirmatory testing was not able to be offered cases are described below and summarized in table 1 case 4 was also included in a

lipase 211 ul and hemoglobin a1c 53 we present here the first four cases of covid-19 disease reported in pt recipients with one case being a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive symptoms and known nosocomial exposure in the absence of confirmatory pcr testing for sars-cov-2 our cases show several notable findings and raise several key management questions first the main presenting symptoms in our pt recipients fever in 100 cough in 75 were similar to what is reported in the non-transplant population 23 diarrhea is reported in 5 of nontransplant patients but was found in 2 of our patients including one without respiratory symptoms diarrhea may be more commonly reported in transplant patients with covid-19 than in the general population 9 whether this finding is due to the concurrent use of transplant medications known to cause diarrhea or other accepted article factors is unclear second similar to the non-transplant population pt recipients presented with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from mild illness managed at home to more severe disease requiring hospitalization and need for supplemental oxygen 4 three of our 4 patients had mild-moderate disease characterized by no pneumonia or mild pneumonia which is similar to the 74 rate of mild-moderate disease reported in solid organ transplant recipients and the 80 rate of mild disease reported in the non-transplant population 49 one patient initially had mild disease but developed respiratory failure 10 days after initial symptom onset and expired this symptom progression is similar to the biphasic disease course described in non-transplant patients in whom worsening respiratory status can develop around 7-10 days after symptom onset 10 11 third in patients for whom glucose levels were available there was no change in glycemic control compared with their premorbid glucose control finally the duration of symptoms in the 3 cases that have resolved was 14-18 days the clinical deterioration of patient 3 after 10 days highlights the importance of close monitoring of suspected or confirmed covid-19 in pt recipients followed in the outpatient setting until complete symptom resolution as the pandemic worsened in new york most patients without dyspnea or hypoxia were not admitted due to the surge in hospitalized patients ambulatory clinics were reduced due to staff redeployment and transition to telemedicine to support social distancing policies making follow-up challenging we managed our outpatient covid-19 pt recipients with frequent check-ins to discuss symptom progression and review vital signs including pulse oximetry when available patients with worsening dyspnea or hypoxia were referred to the emergency department for in-patient management in all 3 of our pt patients who have recovered from covid-19 infection symptoms lasted for at least 2 weeks despite persistence of symptoms none of these patients experienced worsening respiratory status transplant providers caring for pt recipients with covid-19 should be aware that a prolonged disease course in these patients does not imply that a clinical deterioration is inevitable due to uncertainty regarding the duration of viral shedding and infectivity in recovered transplant patients to avoid exposing covid negative patients and staff in our transplant center to the virus we have limited follow-up for our covid-19 pt recipients to either video visits or in-person visits scheduled for hours that our transplant center has dedicated specifically to follow-up for covid-19 patients unfortunately due to limited availability of testing this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved we were unable to perform serial sars-cov2 rna tests to document time to resolution of viral shedding we have reached out to the 3 surviving patient to arrange for testing for the development of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies immunosuppression is usually decreased in the setting of other systemic infections typically with dose reduction or elimination of the antimetabolite when our patients informed us of symptoms consistent with covid-19 infection we held mycophenolate in 3 of our patients and temporarily held tacrolimus in 1 patient on monotherapy a strategy similar to that employed in other solid organ transplant recipients at our center the effect of commonly used antirejection medications on sars-cov-2 is unknown although both tacrolimus and mycophenolate have been shown to inhibit the growth of other coronaviruses 12 13 mycophenolate in combination with interferon- was shown to limit viral replication in vivo but was associated with higher levels of viral shedding in vivo 14 15 it is unknown whether reduction of immunosuppression at disease onset will affect the likelihood of developing cytokine storm syndrome nor is it known when it is safe to reintroduce immunosuppression in patients who recover from covid-19 infection we restarted mycophenolate in 2 patients 5-7 days after resolution of fevers without any recurrence of symptoms over the next 5 weeks at the time these cases were diagnosed there were limited data on the efficacy of various antivral therapies against sars-cov-2 including hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin both of which had been used as adjunctive therapy in covid-19 infection 12 three of our patients with treated with hydroxychloroquine andor azithromycin two of these patients were treated at hospitals away from our center and decisions as to whether and which adjunctive agent to use were made based on institution-specific protocols in place at the time of presentation subsequent studies have suggested an absence of benefits of these adjunctive agents against sars-cov-2 and we have stopped using these agents in our pt and other solid organ transplant recipients 9 16 whether there is a role for other potential therapies such as remdesivir or convalescent plasma in the treatment of sars-cov-2 remains unknown ongoing studies of these therapies are being conducted at our hospital and we have enrolled solid organ transplant recipients when eligible this article is protected by copyright all

effect of temperature on covid-19 early evolution in spain lvaro briz-redn ngel serrano-aroca   history has demonstrated that pathogens may cause devastating consequences in our health and economy thus the rapid spread of the new sars-cov-2 pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a clear current example in this regard the director-general of the world health organization who has recently declared covid-19 a global pandemic on 11 march 2020 starting in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 who 2020c according to the who the current covid-19 outbreak situation has confirmed 1812734 cases and 113675 deaths involving 213 countries who 2020a where spain is one of the leading countries of this global health crisis with 172541 confirmed cases and 18056 confirmed deaths isciii 2020 data reported on april 14th 2020 in a population of about 47 million people nonetheless experts are warning that there could be many more cases that have not been detected andor informed especially in undeveloped countries this strain continues to spread globally overwhelming intensive care units and health system capacity the present outbreak of this coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades and has been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus similar to sars coronavirus and mers liu et al 2020 thus sars-cov-2 is closely related 8889 similarity to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 lai et al 2020 however it is more distant from sars-cov 79 similarity and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 50 similarity jiang et al 2020 lu et al 2020 ren et al 2020 the sars-cov-2 coronavirus is stable from several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces according to a new study from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases centers for disease control and prevention ucla and princeton university scientists van doremalen et al 2020 these scientists have found that sars-cov-2 was detectable in aerosols for up to 3 h up to 4 h on copper up to 24 h on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel these results provide key information about the stability of this strain and suggest that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects thus this pathogen is easily spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact and this type of infection has shown a basic reproduction number of about 224358 lai et al 2020 remuzzi and remuzzi 2020 it is often spread via coughing sneezing touching or even breathing and those who do not exhibit symptoms can also spread the illness american lung association 2020 in fact this coronavirus has been reported to spread faster than its two ancestors sars-cov and mers-cov vellingiri et al 2020 probably due to the high transmission rate produced by asymptomatic carriers bai et al 2020 singhal 2020 standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing and covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing it has also been recommended to avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing and keep a distance of 12 m from them who 2020b the lockdown for the sars-cov-2 epidemic in italy and spain after one month follow up has shown positive results in flattening the epidemic curve tobas 2020 however even though these unprecedented containment and mitigation policies implemented to limit the spread of covid-19 in most countries including travel restrictions screening and testing of travellers isolation and quarantine and school and university closures the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus continues to spread indeed a recent study has demonstrated that under certain combinations of an individual patients physiology and environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature the gas cloud and its payload of pathogen-bearing droplets of all sizes can travel 78 m bourouiba 2020 viruses can be transmitted by being influenced by several factors including climatic conditions temperature and humidity and population density dalziel et al 2018 in this regard previous studies have suggested a correlation between weather and covid-19 pandemic in a similar way that it occurs with other viral infectious diseases such as influenza ficetola and rubolini 2020 liu et al 2020 ma et al 2020 oliveiros et al 2020 tosepu et al 2020 however other studies have reported contradictory results showing that meteorological conditions may not be associated with covid-19 in terms of absolute humidity shi et al 2020 or temperature jamil et al 2020 xie and zhu 2020 according to these last authors the previous results showing evidence for a correlation between meteorological factors with covid-19 transmission was likely to be an artifact reflecting the pathways of spread in fact several of these previous studies have been performed considering only meteorological factors without accounting for non-meteorological variables that might be more decisive spatio-temporal spread of covid-19 has been recently reported for china huang et al 2020 kang et al 2020 and italy giuliani et al 2020 in the present paper we focus on the case of spain spain is located in a temperate zone of the world however it is the most climatically diverse country in europe and it is classified within the 10 most climatically diverse countries in the world ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino aemet 2011 spain is currently a country with the third-highest life expectancy of the world who 2020b which explains somehow the high impact which is causing covid-19 in this country especially in old people for whom this disease represents a major threat morley and vellas 2020 in addition according to the world tourism organization spain was the country in the world with the second highest international tourist arrivals in 2019 unwto 2019 the climate in spain varies across the entire country with five main climatic zones the hot-summer mediterranean climate which is dominant on the iberian peninsula the warm-summer mediterranean climate in parts of north-western spain and mostly inland the central-northern spain the oceanic climate in the northern part of spain the semiarid climate in the south-eastern part of the country the warm-summer continental climate in many areas of the north-eastern zones located over 1000 m above sea level kottek et al 2006 in this study a spatio-temporal analysis of the early evolution of covid-19 across the provinces of spain is carried out the main goal is to explore the existence of a relationship between temperature at the province level and the evolution of the accumulated number of covid-19 cases for approximately the first month of the epidemic in spain the provinces of spain located in the iberian peninsula have been considered for the analysis the balearic and canary islands were discarded for the analysis in order to focus entirely on a more homogeneous area for the same reason the cities of ceuta and melilla which are located in the north of africa were also not included in the analysis covid-19 data corresponding to the provinces of spain was downloaded from a repository publicly available and accessible through this link httpscodemontera34com4443numerotecacovid19 this repository is being maintained by multiple volunteers that are extracting and homogenising covid-19 data from multiple web sources belonging to both official and private media february 25th 2020 has been chosen as the starting date for this early evolution study because it was when the first covid-19 cases were identified in spain the study period spans from this date to march 28th 2020 which corresponds to two weeks after spains lockdown started hence for each province belonging to the study area a time series of length 33 days with the number of daily accumulated covid-19 cases is formed temperature data has been obtained from 172 automatic weather stations installed across the study area the data was downloaded from the opendata platform of the state meteorological agency aemet via the api provided by this institution concretely the daily mean minimum and maximum temperatures in c measured by each of these weather stations from the beginning of february to the end of march have been collected for the analysis temperature data at the province level has been estimated in two stages first ordinary kriging cressie 1988 was used to estimate temperature values over a spatial grid of points covering the whole area under investigation points within the grid were separated by 5 km resulting in a total of nearly 20000 points secondly province-level daily estimations for the variables of interest have been obtained as the average of the estimations corresponding to points of the grid lying within the province table 1
displays a summary of the three temperature-related variables that have been investigated at the province level fig 1
shows the province-level estimations corresponding to mean minimum and maximum temperatures for three days within the period under investigation since this coronavirus has shown a mean incubation period of approximately 5 days ranging from 2 to 14 days nishiura et al 2020 rasmussen et al 2020 the effect of these temperature-related variables has been considered with a time delay of 2 to 14 days hence these temperature-related variables are referred to as temporally-lagged variables in subsequent sections in addition to the effect of temperature on the accumulated number of covid-19 cases other covariates unrelated to meteorological conditions available at the provincial level were also included in the analysis population data by age group corresponding to the start of the year 2020 has been obtained from the spanish statistical office ine at the province level the total population has been used to obtain the population density in habkm2 for each province the population by age group has been utilised to estimate the expected number of covid-19 cases in each province on march 28th 2020 according to the age distribution of all the cases that had been recorded in spain by this date following the official reports that are being published by the ministry of health from spain the number of expected cases for province i on march 28th 2020 which is denoted by e
i was estimated as follows carella 20201eijfjpijwhere p
ij is the population of province i corresponding to age group j and f
j is the incidence of cases in the age group j for the whole population of the country as covid-19 affects the elderly population more severely the probability of testing and hence detecting covid-19 among people from certain age groups is higher hence accounting for the age structure of each province is convenient for data modelling purposes finally the number of travellers that have stayed in each province during february 2020 and the number of companies by province were also obtained from the ine the number of travellers was estimated by the ine through survey procedures in this analysis a traveller is consider someone that came from other province or country to spend at least one night in the corresponding province during the month of reference thus a higher number of travellers arriving at some provinces in february 2020 could have increased the risk of the spread of covid-19 in subsequent weeks similarly the fact that a province has a higher number of active companies can induce intranational mobility during working days the r programming language r core team 2020 has been used to carry out the statistical analyses involved in the present investigation in particular the r packages automap hiemstra et al 2008 ggplot2 wickham 2016 gstat pebesma 2004 grler et al 2016 inla rue et al 2009 lindgren and rue 2015 rgdal bivand et al 2019 spdep bivand et al 2008 were required for the analysis the number of accumulated covid-19 cases at the province level has been investigated through spatio-temporal modelling techniques specifically the accumulated number of covid-19 cases detected in each province i on a day t from february 25th 2020 to march 28th 2020 has been assumed to follow a poisson distribution with mean e

i however some of these covariates are highly correlated to each other for which reason it is convenient to use them separately or to make a selection of them to avoid multicollinearity issues population density the number of visitors and the number of companies all show a pearsons correlation above 085 at the province level table 2
 fitting three independent models with each of these covariates alone yielded very similar results therefore population density was chosen for being the most common and accessible variable of the three similarly the three temperature-related covariates are also highly correlated which led us to define three different models each of whom only included one of them the rest of the random effects indicated in eq 2 were considered for the three models fig 2

fig 3
shows the third-degree polynomials that were estimated by each of the three models considering lag7 and lag14 days the results for other lag values are very similar so only these two are displayed the range of temperatures displayed in each of the six plots provided in fig 3 covers the 95 of the mean minimum or maximum temperatures available in the dataset the solid curves in each of them correspond to the polynomial that can be built according to the coefficients of the first- second- and third-degree terms that are estimated by the model in each case the dotted lines correspond to the polynomials that are defined by the 25 and 975 percentiles of the posterior distributions of these three coefficients no trend is observed neither with increasing mean minimum nor maximum temperature specifically the fact that the dotted lines do not lie consistently within the upper or lower half-plane indicates that there is no clear evidence of a contribution to relative risks by any range of the temperature-related variables the analysis of how certain meteorological conditions may have affected the initial spread of covid-19 at the country city or regional level has become an important line of research in recent weeks in many of these studies non-meteorological factors have not been included in the analysis we highlight the need for considering non-meteorological factors such as population density to get more reliable results in addition we have also accounted for the age structure of each region under study which seems very convenient because of the existing age-group differences in detection rates in this study no consistent evidence has been found regarding the existence of a relationship between the accumulated number of covid-19 cases in the provinces of spain and temperature values at the province level this conclusion is in good agreement with a previous study on the association between mean temperature and covid-19 spread performed in 122 cities of china xie and zhu 2020 although the authors of this study found that mean temperature was positively associated with newly confirmed cases when temperature was below 3 this association was not observed for temperatures above 3 which is close to the range of mean temperature measured in spain for the period that we have investigated 95 of the daily mean temperature values observed ranged from 5 to 18 in this regard it is important to note that the period under study is months ahead from the summer season where temperatures will be considerably higher future studies may lead to different findings but no extrapolation to warmer periods should be done from current investigations in conclusion further research would be needed to better elucidate the role of several meteorological variables on the expansion of the covid-19 epidemic for several reasons currently available data on the epidemic is subject to a large degree of uncertainty the number of confirmed cases is globally underestimated and comparisons across countries cities or regions are difficult to be determined due to differences in data collection procedures or health policies among others under these circumstances every statistical analysis of covid-19 data needs to be interpreted with caution royal statistical society 2020 it is also important to remark that measuring the effect of weather-related covariates on the virus transmission is highly complex indeed weather usually affects several aspects of human daily life such as commuting choices or leisure activities among many others therefore the interaction between weather conditions and human behaviour can be a confounder of the true relationship between environmental conditions and virus propagation

 the authors declare no conflict of interest  synergistic learning of lung lobe segmentation and hierarchical multi-instance classification for automated severity assessment of covid-19 in ct images severe non-severe  journal of l a t e x class  files  understanding chest ct imaging of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 will help detect infections early and assess the disease progression especially automated severity assessment of covid-19 in ct images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care however it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in ct images due to variable infection regions in the lungs similar imaging biomarkers and large intercase variations to this end we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of covid-19 in 3d ct images by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification considering that only a few infection regions in a ct image are related to the severity assessment we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2d image patches with each cropped from a specific slice a multi-task multi-instance deep network called m 2 unet is then developed to assess the severity of covid-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously our m 2 unet consists of a patch-level encoder a segmentation subnetwork for lung lobe segmentation and a classification subnetwork for severity assessment with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy here the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve   typical cases of two non-severe left and two severe right patients with covid-19 where infections often occur in small regions of the lungs in ct images the similar imaging biomarkers eg ground glass opacities mosaic sign air bronchogram and interlobular septal thickening of both cases denoted by red boxes make the non-severe and severe images difficult to distinguish the performance of severity assessment extensive experiments were performed on a real covid-19 ct image dataset consisting of 666 chest ct images with results suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods golden standard for covid-19 is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test the effectiveness of those imaging-base applications is limited moreover approximately 80 of patients with covid-19 have only mild to moderate symptoms 9  while the remaining patients have severe symptoms based on previous studies 5  10  the imaging-based characters of covid-19 patients are distinct to related diseases eg viral pneumonia therefore the severity assessment of the disease is of high clinical value which helps effectively allocate medical resources such as ventilator among various radiological examinations chest ct imaging plays an essential role in fighting this infectious disease by helping early identify lung infections and assess the severity of the disease previous studies show that computed tomography ct has the ability to provide valuable information in the screening and diagnosis 10  in this work ct help the clinicians to evaluate the condition of the patients in advance by which necessary measures or treatments could better proceed especially for severe patients in time however automatically assess the severity of covid-19 in ct images is a very challenging task first infections caused by covid-19 often occur in small regions of the lungs and are difficult to identify in ct images as shown in fig 1  second imaging biomarkers of covid-19 patients caused by an infection are similar in some severe and non-severe cases are similar including ground-glass opacities ggo mosaic sign air bronchogram and interlobular septal thickening fig 1  in addition there are large inter-case variations in ct images of covid-19 patients fig 2  because these images are usually acquired by multiple imaging centers with different scanners and different scanning parameters several recent methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of covid-19 2 3 4  with only some specifically designed for severity assessment of the disease in several studies 5 6 7  segmentation of lung or lung lobe is used as a prerequisite procedure for diagnosis purposes however most of these methods treat the lung lobe segmentation and disease diagnosis as two separate tasks ignoring their underlying association note that the segmentation of lung lobe can provide rich information regarding spatial locations and tissue types in ct images therefore it is intuitively reasonable to jointly perform lung lobe segmentation and severity assessmentprediction where the context information provided by segmentation results can be used to improve the prediction performance the joint learning scheme is obviously faster than the two-stage framework since detecting and cropping the lung field are not needed besides as demonstrated by related works of class activation maps cams 11  the classification task raises high signal responses in lung lobe area where the infection patterns of lung lobe in disease progression could also provide useful guidance for the segmentation of lung lobes moreover most of the previous works are based on 2d image slices 2 3 4  however the annotation of 2d ct slices is a heavy workload for radiologists it is interesting to directly employ 3d ct images for automated severity assessment of covid-19 which is desired for real-world clinical applications to this end in this paper we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of covid-19 in 3d ct images by jointly performing severity assessment of covid-19 patients and lung lobe segmentation the proposed method extends the previous conference work 12 to deal with 3d images and makes substantial methodological improvements for the task of covid-19 severity assessment specifically considering that only a few slices in ct images are related to severity assessment each input ct image is represented by a bag of 2d image patches each of which is randomly cropped from a specific slice furthermore each slice is represented by a bag of infection regions represented by intermediate embedding features with each bag as input a multi-task multi-instance deep neural network called m 2 unet is developed including 1 a shared patchlevel encoder 2 a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe segmentation and 3 a classification sub-network for severity assessment of covid-19 patients ie severe or non-severe using a hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy here the segmentation results are used to provide context information of input ct images to boost the performance of severity assessment extensive experiments have been performed on a real-world covid-19 dataset with 666 chest ct images with the results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods the contributions of this work are three-fold  a multi-task multi-instance learning framework is proposed to jointly assess the severity of the covid-19 patients and segment lung lobes in chest ct images where the segmentation task provides context information to aid the task of severity assessment in chest ct image  a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy is developed to predict the severity of patients in a weakly supervised manner  we evaluate the proposed method on a real clinical dataset with 666 3d ct images of covid-19 patients achieving promising results in severity assessment compared to several state-of-the-art methods the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the related works for the segmentation and diagnosis of ct images of covid-19 patients as well as related studies on deep multi-instance learning then we introduce the proposed method in section 3 in section 4 we present the materials experimental setup and experimental results finally we conclude this paper and present several future research directions in section 5 in this section we briefly review the most relevant studies from the following three aspects 1 lung segmentation of ct images with covid-19 2 automated diagnosis of covid-19 patients and 3 deep multi-instance learning segmentation of lung or lung lobe has been used as a common pre-requisite procedure for automatic diagnosis of covid-19 based on chest ct images several deep learning methods have been proposed for the segmentation of lung in ct images with covid-19 for instance u-net et al  13 has been widely used for segmentation of both lung regions and lung lesions in covid-19 applications 7  14 15 16  qi et al  7 use u-net to delineate the lesions in the lung and extract radiometric features of covid-19 patients with the initial seeds given by a radiologist for predicting hospital stay also several variants of u-net have been applied to the diagnosis or severity assessment of covid-19 jin et al  6 design a two-stage pipeline to screen covid-19 in ct images and they utilize u-net 17 to detect the whole lung region and to separate lesions from lung regions besides v-net 18 is also used in various segmentation applications shan et al  5 integrates human-in-the-loop strategy into the training process of vb-net a variant of v-net the human-aided strategy is an intuitive way to address the issue of lacking manual labels during segmentation in ct images both x-rays 19 and ct images 10 can provide effective information for the computer-assisted diagnosis of covid-19 compared with x-rays chest ct imaging contains hundreds of slices which is clearer and more precise but has to take more time for specialists to diagnose therefore there is a great demand to use ct images for automated diagnosis of covid-19 in general the existing methods for covid-19 diagnosis based on ct images can be roughly divided into two categories 1 classification 2 severity assessment in the former category many studies have been conducted to determine whether patients are infected with covid-19 disease for example chen et al  2 exploits a unet based segmentation model to segment covid-19 related lesions in chest ct images of 51 covid-19 patients and 55 patients with other diseases and finally determine the label covid-19 or non-covid-19 of each image based on the segmented lesions ying et al  3 propose a ct diagnosis system namely deeppneumonia which is based on the resnet50 model to identify patients with covid-19 from bacteria pneumonia patients and healthy people in the second category tang et al  4 proposed to first adopt vb-net to separate the lung into anatomical sub-regions and then use these sub-regions to compute quantitative features for training a random forest rf model for covid-19 severity assessment with labels of being non-severe or severe the scenario of multi-instance learning mil 20 21 22 or learning from weakly annotated data 23 arises when only a general statement of the category is given but multiple instances can be observed mil aims to learn a model that can predict the label of a bag accurately and many recent studies have focused on implementing mil via deep neural networks for instance oquab et al  23 train a deep model with multiple image patches of multiple scales as input and aggregate the prediction results of multiple inputs by using a max-pooling operation besides many studies 24 25 26 propose to formulate image classification as a mil problem so as to address the weakly supervised problem moreover mil is particularly suitable for problems with only a limited number eg tens or hundreds of training samples in various medical image-based applications such as computer-assisted disease diagnosis 27 28 29 30  for instance yan et al  29 propose a two-stage deep mil method to find discriminative local anatomies where the first-stage convolutional neural network cnn is learned in a mil fashion to locate discriminative image patches and the second-stage cnn is boosted using those selected patches more recently a landmark-based deep mil framework 30 ct image is first pre-processed and multiple 2d image patches with each patch from a specific slice are then extracted to construct an instance bag for representing each input ct scan this bag is then fed into the proposed multi-task multi-instance unet m 2 unet for joint lung lobe segmentation and severity assessment of covid-19 consisting of a shared patch-level encoder a segmentation sub-network and a classification sub-network for severity assessment here the segmentation task can provide location and tissue guidance for the task of severity assessment that employs a hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy since there are only a limited number of cases at hand it is desirable to employ the multi-instance learning strategy for severity assessment of covid-19 patients in chest ct images the framework of the proposed method is illustrated in fig 3  where the input is the raw 3d ct image and the output is the lung segmentation and severity assessment of covid-19 patients ie severe or non-severe specifically each 3d ct image is processed via several image pre-processing steps then a set of 2d image patches is randomly cropped from the processed image to construct an instance bag and each bag represents a specific input ct image this bag is regarded as the input of the proposed multi-task multi-instance u-net m 2 unet the m 2 unet is designed to learn two tasks jointly ie severity assessment of a covid-19 patient and segmentation of the lung lobe as shown in fig 3  in m 2 unet an encoding module is first used for patch-level feature extraction of 2d patches in each input bag followed by two sub-networks for joint severity assessment and lung lobe segmentation specifically in the classification sub-network these extracted patch-level features are fed into a feature embedding module and an image-level feature learning module to capture the local-toglobal volume representation of the input ct image with the learned volume features a classification layer is finally used to assess the severity of each covid-19 patient ie severe or non-severe in the segmentation sub-network those patchlevel features are fed into a decoding module to perform lung lobe segmentation for each patch in the input bag since these two sub-networks are trained jointly with a shared patch-level encoder the context information provided by the segmentation results can be implicitly employed to improve the performance of severity assessment to eliminate the effect of the background noise in each raw 3d ct image we crop each scan to only keep the region containing the human body by using a threshold-based processing method specifically we first binarize the image using the threshold of zero through which the human tissues and the gas regions will be separated then the human body region is cropped according to the binary mask each body region image has a size of at least 256  256 for the axial plane in this work while image resampling is commonly used in many deep learning methods for segmentation and classification 31  32  we do not resample the raw ct images in order to preserve their original data distributions since our method is clinical-oriented with inconsistent imaging qualities ct images used in this study are not as clean as those in benchmark datasets 33  for example the physical spacing of our data has large variation eg from 06 mm to 10 mm between slices because of the use of different ct scanners and scanning parameters using a common interpolation method eg tri-linear interpolation to resample a ct image into 1 mm one will introduce heavy artifacts to the image besides only a few infection regions in each ct image are related to severity assessment to this end we employ the weakly supervised multi-instance learning mil strategy for handing these inconsistent ct images specifically for each preprocessed ct image we randomly crop a set of 2d patches sampled from 2d slices with each patch from a specific slice in each image to construct an instance bag and each bag is used to represent a specific ct image and treated as the input of the subsequent m 2 unet in this way the inter-slicepatch relationships can be implicitly captured by our m 2 unet in addition this mil strategy represents each 3d image through a set of 2d image patches rather than sequential slices this can partially alleviate the problem of data inconsistency so our method has high practical value in real-world applications as shown in fig 3  using each bag consisting of a set of 2d image patches as the input data the proposed m 2 unet first employs an encoding module for patch-level feature extraction based on these features the classification and segmentation sub-networks are then used to jointly perform two tasks respectively ie 1 severity assessment of the patients and 2 segmentation of lung lobes in each patch specifically the classification sub-network uses a unique hierarchical mil strategy to extract the local-to-global representation of each input image with an embedding-level mil module an imagelevel mil module and a classification module the segmentation sub-network contains a decoding module to segment lung lobes of 2d image patches in each bag the detailed network architecture is listed in table i  the combination of the encoder and decoder is u-net like with four down-sampling blocks in the encoder and four upsampling blocks in the decoder the outputs of the same level blocks in the encoder and decoder are concatenated and fed into the next block of the decoder limited by computational resources all the convolutional layers in the encoder and decoder have the same number ie 64 of kernels except the last block in the encoder the last block of encoder outputs 512 dimensional features to help build a more robust classification for severity assessment the decoder outputs the corresponding segmentation mask of five types of lung lobes for each image patch while infection regions of the lung related to covid-19 eg nodule and ggo are usually located in regions of the ct image the category of each ct image is labeled at the entire image level rather than the region-level that is many regions are actually unrelated to the classification task for severity assessment multi-instance learning mil provides a useful tool to solve such a weakly supervised problem conventional mil represents a 2d image as a bag and each bag consists of multiple regions of the input image ie instances their overall prediction is made at the bag-level by roughly two kinds of methods ie the embedding-level methods and the instance-level methods the former learns the relationship among instances by projecting them into a new embedding space the latter directly generates the bag-level predictions by performing voting on the instance predictions however both methods are inapplicable for the classification of 3d images as 3d images contain multiple 2d image slices and the class labels are also related to some local regions of the slices in this work based on the previous study on pathological images 12  we propose a hierarchical mil strategy in the classification sub-network of our m 2 unet to perform severity assessment of covid-19 in 3d ct images as shown in fig 3  as mentioned in section iii-b we represent each input 3d volumetric image as a bag consisting of a set of 2d image patches and these patches are regarded as the instances in the mil problem settings formally we first construct a bag with n 2d patches cropped from the regional slices to represent each input ct image denote the i-th and the j-th 3d ct image as x i and x j  respectively where x i   ins i1   ins i2       ins ini  and x j   ins j1   ins j2       ins jnj  here  ins kl  r d k  1 2     n k  indicates the l-th instance of the k-th image then these 2d patches size height  width are fed into the encoding module for patchinstance-level feature extraction these instance-level features are further fed into an embedding-level mil module which will be introduced later after obtaining the instance-level features the bagimage-level feature  i are then generated by our proposed global contrast pooling gcp layer in the image-level mil module as illustrated in fig 4  the proposed gcp layer aims to make the instance features closer to the relevant concepts and also push those irrelevant instance features and concepts away from each other in this work the term concept denotes the to-be-learned feature of gcp layer that is discriminative for severity assessment theoretically the concept is a normalized weight to map features in instance feature space to an ordered embedding space specifically in the gcp layer we assume the bag-level feature  i is represented by the relationship between instance features and p concepts here these concepts are learned to reveal the data structure in a global perspective the bag-level feature is then denoted as a p dimensional feature vector with each dimension denoting the maximum similarity between one concept and all instance features we use the cosine function to measure such relationships thus the bag feature and the similarity can be written as where s im m  1     p is the maximum similarity between the instance features of the i-th bag and the m-th image-level concept w m  r denotes the commonly used regularization term used in deep networks with eqs 1-2 one can observe that the proposed gcp layer can automatically learn the concepts that are related to those discriminative instances thus reducing the influence of those irrelevant instances note such a gcp layer can be also used in other weakly supervised problems where only a small portion of regions in an image are related to the task at hand such as mri-based brain disorder diagnosis 30  we further use an embedding-level mil module with a gcp layer to learn embedding-level representations by regarding each image patch as a bag and the intermediate patch-level features produced by the encoder as instances in this way the relationships among small regions in each patch can be modeled by our method based on the embedding-level features an image-level mil module with a gcp layer is further used to generate the volume features based on the volume features we use a fully-connected layer followed by a cross-entropy loss to predict the severity score ie severe or non-severe of each input ct image the final loss function in the proposed hierarchical mil network for severity assessment can be formulated as where f c denotes the mapping function of the fullyconnected layer and y denotes the severity type confirmed by clinicians the segmentation task is supervised by the aggregation of cross-entropy loss and dice loss as follows wherep c n and l c n denote the predicted and ground-truth segmentation masks for the n-th patch in the c-th category in this work we segment c  7 categories including five parts of lung lobes and the background it is worth noting that most of the cases in our dataset do not have groundtruth segmentation masks for these cases we simply avoid calculating the segmentation loss for them finally the losses in eqs 3 and 4 are trained simultaneously in a multi-task learning manner and the overall loss of the proposed method is written as where  is the trade-off parameter used to balance the contributions of these two tasks in this work  is empirically set to 001 the proposed method is implemented based on the opensource deep learning library pytorch the training of the network is accelerated by four nvidia tesla v100 gpus each with 32 gb memory for feasible learning of the lung region images we clamp the intensities of the image into 1200 0 which indicates that we use the width of 1200 and the level of 600 for the pulmonary window then the data is normalized to the value of 0 255 as used by other deep learning methods the dataset is highly imbalanced as the number of severe patients is much fewer than the nonsevere patient the ratio of the severe patient is less than 20 in our dataset therefore we augmented the data by directly duplicated the severe cases in the training set this can be done because the proposed method uses a random cropping strategy to construct the inputs this makes the duplicated cases not the same to each other for the training of the network we also use the random cropping strategy in the testing stage by assuming that the data distribution is already well learned in training other cropping strategies eg center cropping may not be suitable here as the center of pulmonary is dominated by the trachea and other tissues in both training and testing stage we randomly crop 200 image patches from each input 3d ct image to construct the image-level bag ie with the bag size of n  200 and we use the output of the encoder to construct the embeddinglevel bag that contains 8  8 feature maps we train m 2 unet using the learning rate of 001 with a decay strategy of poly with the power of 075 the network is optimized by a standard stochastic gradient descent sgd algorithm with 100 epochs and the weights are decayed by a rate of 110 4 with the momentum of 09 in this section we first introduce the materials competing methods and experimental setup we then present the experimental results achieved by our method and several state-ofthe-art methods we finally investigate the influence of two major strategies used in our method more results on parameter analysis can be found in the supplementary materials the real covid-19 dataset contains a total of 666 3d chest ct scans acquired from 242 patients who are confirmed with covid-19 ie rt-pcr test positive these ct images are collected from seven hospitals with a variety of ct scanners including philips ingenuity ct idose4 ge bright speed s siemens somatom perspective hitachi eclos and anke anatom 16hd the images are of large variation in terms of the image size of 512  512  666  23  732 and the spatial resolution of 0586  0984 mm 0586  0984 mm and 0399  10 mm obviously diagnosis based on these images is a very challenging task the severity of the patient is confirmed by clinicians following the guideline of 2019-ncov trail version 7 issued by the china national health commission the severity of the patient is categorized into four types ie mild moderate severe and critical in clinical practice patients are often divided into two groups with different treatment regimens ie severe and non-severe the segmentation of 152 out of 666 images were delineated by an ai-based software and confirmed by experienced radiologists in this work we employ this partitioning strategy that is mild and moderate are treated as non-severe while severe and critical are regarded as severe therefore the task of severe assessment is formulated into a binary classification problem therefore the dataset is partitioned into 51 severe and 191 non-severe patients we first compare the proposed m 2 unet with four stateof-the-art methods in 4  34 35 36 for severity assessment of covid-19 patients the first two methods 4  36 are both based on hand-crafted features of ct images while the last two 34  35 are deep learning-based methods that can learn imaging features automatically from data specifically tang et al  4 first segment the lung lung lobe and lesions in ct images then the quantitative features of covid-19 patients eg the infection volume and the ratio of the whole lung are calculated based on the segmentation results the prediction is done by a random forest method yang et al  36 propose to aggregate infection scores calculated on 20 lung regions for severity assessment besides the resnet50max method 34 is also compared for patch-wise classification resnet50max is a non-mil method which has a resnet-50 network architecture and performs image-level classification through max-voting in addition we apply the gated att mil method proposed in 35 on our dataset which is a one-stage mil method with an attention mechanism for fair comparison this method shares the same multi-instance pool as our m 2 unet we further compare our method with two state-of-the-art methods for lung lobe segmentation including 1 unet 13  and 2 unet 17  the parameter settings for these five competing methods are the same as those in their respective papers to evaluate the influence of the proposed multi-task learning and hierarchical mil strategies used in m 2 unet we further compare m 2 unet with its two variants 1 m 2 unet with only the classification sub-network denoted as clas only 2 m 2 unet with only the segmentation sub-network denoted as seg only a five-fold cross-validation cv strategy is used in the experiments for performance evaluation specifically the whole dataset is first randomly partitioned into five subsets with approximately equal sample size of subjects we treat one subset as the testing set 20 while the remaining four subsets are combined to construct the training set 70 and validation set 10 the validation set here is used for selecting the hyper-parameters this process is iterated until each subsets serve as a testing set once the final results are reported on the test set two tasks are included in the proposed method ie classification of severity assessment and 2 segmentation of the lung lobe for performance evaluation two sets of metrics are used in these two tasks with the details given below 1 metrics for classification we use five commonly used metrics to evaluate the classification performance achieved by different methods in the severity assessment task ie accuracy precision recall f1 score and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc p recision  t p t p  f p  recall  t p t p  f n  where tp tn fp and fn denote true positive true negative false positive and false negative respectively 2 metrics for segmentation we use three metrics ie dice similarity coefficient dsc positive predict value ppv and sensitivity sen to evaluate the segmentation performance of different methods with the definitions given below where v gt and v seg represent the ground-truth and predicted segmentation maps for each scan respectively d comparison with state-of-the-art methods 1 results of severity assessment we first report the performance of six different methods in the task of severity assessment for covid-19 patients with the results shown in table ii  note that the results from the competing methods are directly obtained from the respective papers as can be seen four deep learning-based methods usually outperform two hand-crafted feature-based methods in most cases for some specific metrics the method in 4 achieves the recall of 0933 which is significantly better than the non-mil method resnet50max the conventional mil-based method in 35 gets a performance improvement in terms of accuracy by 8 three mil methods ie 35  cls only and m 2 unet yield satisfying performance and the proposed m 2 unet achieves the best results eg the accuracy of 985 and f1 score of 991 however the proposed method with multiple instances in multi-instance learning achieves the accuracy of 985 and f1 score of 991 the receiver operating characteristic roc curves of six competing methods are illustrated in fig 6  note that this roc curve is plotted based on the results on one fold testing data which is slightly different from the average performance on five-folds in table ii table ii and fig 6 clearly suggest that our m 2 unet generates the overall best performance in the task of severity assessment of covid-19 patients based on chest ct images 2 results of lung lobe segmentation we then report the results of lung lobe segmentation achieved by four different methods in table iii  comparing seg only and the conventional u-net the former dramatically reduces the parameter from 13171mb to 1437mb as a consequence the performance in terms of dsc and ppv is also decreased by 17 and 49 respectively by using multi-task learning m 2 net improves the performance from 0759 to 0785 in terms of dsc which also outperform the performance of conventional u-net with a decreasing of parameters from 13171 to 1532 the proposed m 2 unet also achieves a slightly higher performance compared with u-net the visualization of segmentation results achieved by three different methods on two subjects is shown in fig 5  from this figure we can see that m 2 unet generates the overall best segmentation masks while u-net and u-net usually yield under-segmentation results on these cases these results further show the advantage of our m 2 unet we further evaluate the influence of two major strategies used in our m 2 unet ie 1 the hierarchical mil strategy for classification and 2 the multi-task learning strategy for joint severity assessment and lung lobe segmentation 1 influence of hierarchical mil strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of the hierarchical mil strategy we compare the variant of the proposed m 2 unet ie cls only without the segmentation subnetwork with a non-mil method ie resnet50max and a one-stage mil method ie gated att mil 35  the classification results of these three methods in the task of severity assessment are reported in table iv  as shown in table iv  two mil methods ie gated att mil 2 influence of multi-task learning strategy our m 2 unet can jointly learn the segmentation task and the classification task in a multi-task learning manner here we also investigate the influence of such a multi-task learning paradigm by comparing m 2 unet with its two single-task variants ie cls only for classification and seg only for segmentation the performance comparison in two tasks for severity assessment and lung lobe segmentation are reported in table v and  table vii  respectively table v suggests that compared with cls only the multi-task learning paradigm used in m 2 unet helps to improve the classification accuracy by 16 while increasing the precision score by over 5 and the f1 score by 25 notably the f1 and precision of the cls only method are already higher than 90 which are hard to be improved this is more valuable in this classification scheme as the f1 score is more representative in evaluating such an imbalanced classification task as can be observed from table vii  although m 2 unet is not specifically designed for lung lobe segmentation it still improves the overall segmentation performance in terms of three metrics compared with its single-task variant ie seg only this implies that the proposed multi-task learning strategy is useful in boosting the learning performance of both tasks of severity assessment and lung lobe segmentation we further investigate the performance of our method using different size of bags and the results are shown in table vi  specifically we vary the bag size within 50 80 100 150 200 as shown in the table the performance of m 2 unet for classification changes along with the bag size the proposed method achieves the best performance with the bag size of 200 another observation is that the table suggests the performance of the proposed ai-based severity assessment model is not sensitive with the bag size when larger than 100 indicating that at least 100 patches are required for the proposed method to achieve an acceptable result v conclusion and future work in this paper we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment and lung segmentation of covid-19 in 3d chest ct images in this framework we first represent each input image by a bag to deal with the challenging problem that the severity is related to local infected regions in the ct image we further develop a multitask multi-instance deep network called m 2 unet to assess the severity of covid-19 patients and segment the lung lobe simultaneously where the context information provided by segmentation can be employed to boost the performance of severity assessment a hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy is also proposed in m 2 unet for severity assessment experimental results on a real covid-19 ct image dataset demonstrate that our method achieves promising results in severity assessment of covid-19 patients compared with several state-of-the-art methods in the current work the severity assessment of covid-19 only relies on one time-point data without considering longitudinal imaging biomarkers it is interesting to perform a longitudinal study to investigate the progression of the disease which is one of our future work since annotations for lung lobe in 3d ct images are usually tedious and error-prone only a small number of subjects in our dataset have groundtruth segmentation therefore it is highly desired to develop automated or even semi-automated image annotation methods which will also be studied in the future  sars-cov genome polymorphism a bioinformatics study gordana pavlovi-laeti m nenad miti s andrija tomovi m mirjana pavlovi d milo beljanski v   severe acute respiratory syndrome sars potentially fatal atypical pneumonia first appeared in guangdong province of china in november 2002 and soon afterward within six months spreaded all over the world 30 countries including china singapore vietnam canada and usa killing more than 700 people 1 in less than four weeks after the global outbreak a novel member of coronaviridae family namely sars coronavirus sars-cov was identified in the blood of respiratory specimens and stools of sars patients and confirmed as the causative agent of disease according to the koch postulates 2 soon afterwards first fully sequenced genomes of viral isolates were published 3 4 in 2005 the number of fully sequenced viral isolates exceeds one hundred httpwwwncbinlmnihgoventrez sars-cov probably originated due to genetic exchange recombination andor mutations between viruses with different host specificities 5 6 since coronaviruses are known to relatively easily jump among species it was hypothesized that the new virus might have originated from wild animals the analysis of sars-cov proteins supports and suggests possible past recombination event between mammalianlike and avian-like parent viruses 6 common sequence variants define three distinct genotypes of the sars-cov one linked with animal palm civet paguma larvata sars-like viruses and early human phase the other two linked with middle and late human phases respectively 7 8 sars-cov has a deleterious mutation of 29 nucleotides relative to the palm civet virus indicating that if there was direct transmission it went from civet to human because deletions occur probably more easily than insertions 5 however more recent reports indicate that sars-cov is distinct from the civet virus and it has not been answered so far whether the sars-cov originated from civet or civet was infected from other species 9 10 the genome is relatively stable since its mutation rate has been determined to be between 183106 and 826106 nucleotide substitutions per site per day 11 the sars-cov genome is approximately 30 kb positive single strand rna that corresponds to polycistronic mrna consisting of 5 and 3 untranslated regions utrs 13 to 15 open reading frames orfs and about 10 intergenic regions igrs 9 12 13 its genome includes genes encoding two replicate polyproteins rna-dependant-rna-polymerase ie pp 1a and pp 1ab encompassing two-thirds of the genome and a set of orfs at 3 end that code for four structural proteins surface spike s glycoprotein 1256 aa envelope e 77 aa matrix m 222 aa and nucleocapsid n 423 aa proteins it also encodes for additional 8-9 predicted orfs whose protein product functions are still under investigation 14 httpwwwncbinlmnihgoventrez the s protein is the main surface antigen of the sars-cov and is involved in virus attachment on susceptible cells using mechanism similar to those of class i fusion proteins the receptor for the sars-cov s protein is identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 which is a metallopeptidase 15 the receptor-binding domain rbd has been determined to lay between aa postions 270-625 in recent studies 16 17 18 19 20 several epitope sites defined by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies have been identified on the s protein depending on experimental conditions all lying within wide or narrow regions between aa 12-1192 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 defining conserved immunodominant epitope regions of the s protein is of crucial importance for future anti-sars vaccine development the main goal of this work was twofold to perform mutation analysis of sars-cov viral genomes with special attention to the s protein and to group them according to different aspects of sequence similarity eventually pointing to phylogeny and epidemiological dynamics of sars-cov nucleotide content of sars-cov isolates favors t and a nucleotides the corresponding percentages of letters in non-utr regions of all the 96 isolates were found to be as follows t 307940 a 284246 g 208121 c 199535 n g a t c 00143 r pur 00005 k g or t 00001 m a or c 00002 s g or c 00001 w a or t 00002 and y pyr 00004 the overall ratio of atgc in the dataset was almost 32 145 the ratio of pur vs pyr nucleotides was almost 1 097 the distribution of nucleotides nt over sequences of length 250 nt is given in figure s1 supporting online material it exhibits three peak-regions of t nucleotide in the second quarter of the genome orf 1a and rather stable behavior in the third quarter of the genome orf 1b as also observed by pyrc et al 32 for a group of coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e sars-cov and hcov-oc43 deviation of percentage of nucleotides over 250-nt blocks from the corresponding percentage in the whole dataset is given in figure s2 except for 3 utr where t nucleotide is underrepresented with even about 13 the highest excess from the average is about 10 in four peaks which is exhibited again by t nucleotide three of them being between positions 7000 and 11000 orf 1a complementary with the nucleotide a represented with 10 and the fourth one in the s protein otherwise the nucleotides offset oscillates rather regularly between 5 and 5 from the average there were 446 snv sites and 1006 snvs in total in the dataset with the substitution rate 149 which is about three times higher both the number of snvs and the substitution rate than the corresponding findings 33 for 17 isolates an average number of snvs per isolate was 1048 giving an error rate of 36104 substitutions per nucleotide copied there was only one site with multiple base substitutions the original nucleotide base on that position being t at the relative clustal x position 8441 orf 1a isolate zmy 1 has the nucleotide c absolute position 8403 and isolates shanghaiqxc1 shanghaiqxc2 have the nucleotide a absolute positions 8312 and 7733 respectively the smallest distance between the two neighboring snv sites in the whole dataset was 1 the largest one was 23988 in case of tw3 and tw1 while an average distance between the neighboring snv sites in the whole dataset was 1987 positions figure s3 the distribution of isolates per snv number outside 5 3 utrs showed regularity for up to 11 snvs almost gaussian distribution and irregular decrease for number of snvs 11 figure s4 thus the number of snvs less than or equal to 11 per isolate was considered as a small number of snvs and the number of snvs greater than 11 was considered as a large number of snvs most snvs are clustered within two regions in orf la and one region at the 3 end of the viral genome that predominantly consists of small orfs leaving two small regions within orf 1a and a region that corresponds to orf 1b as the most conservative ones figure 1b the entropy of each genome nucleotide position was calculated showing that the most conserved sites are the ones with the smallest entropy and that the least conserved sites are the ones with the highest entropy 34 figure s5 the nine loci used for classification can be found among the sites with the highest entropy percent of each category of substitution is given in figure 2 there are 141 transversion sites and 306 transition sites ie 31546846 with 261 transversions 272 in average per isolate and 745 transitions 776 in average per isolate analysis of the sars-cov genome showed that long indels were concentrated close to the 3 end except for the 579-nt deletion in the shanghaiqxc2 isolate at the position 5834 located in orf 1a while individual insertions were found along the whole genome most in the second quarter and individual deletions were quite rare density distribution of indels inside the sars-cov genome and 5 utr

annotation which is especially abundant with indels while individual indels are present both in longer and shorter orfs longer indels are except for previously mentioned deletions in the shanghaiqxc2 all located in short orfs figure 3 represents comparison results of genome primary structure of the analyzed isolates summarizing the following facts firstly although the sars-cov genome has the established length of 29727 nt 12 most isolates were shorter at the 5 end for the first 15 positions majority of isolates were empty and had various length poly-a strings at the 3 end or both table 1 several isolates had some short deletions inside the sequence eg sin2677 sin2748 twc pumc02 pumc03 twj whu sino1-11 sino3-11 tw11 and sinp5 secondly there was a group of isolates that had insertions of length 29 nucleotides gd01 sz3 sz16 gz02 hsz-bb hsz-bc hsz-cb and hsz-cc at the relative position 27995 absolute position 27869 in sz3 sz16 hsz-cc and hsz-bc protein bgi-pup gz29-nt-ins orf 8a two of them were isolates from palm civet sz3 and sz16 and the other six were isolates from human patients this specific insertion is also treated as a deletion in all the other isolates evolved from this early group 10 thirdly there were several groups of isolates that had long deletions gz-b gz-c length 39 at the relative position 27882 or absolute position 27719 in gz-c orf 7b zs-a zs-c length 53 at the relative position 27969 absolute 27843 in zs-a orf 8a lc2 lc3 lc5 length 386 at the relative position 27829 absolute 27704 in lc2 orfs 7b 8a 8b shanghaiqxc2 length 579 at the relative position 5959 absolute 5834 orf la sin852 sin849 and sin846 of length 57 49 137 respectively at relative positions in region between 27787 and 27966 orfs 7b 8a tables 1 and s2 figure 3 fourthly a large number of individual indels were identified in zj01 zmy 1 sinp2 and sinp3 tables 1 and s2 figure 3 while the distribution of nucleotides over different distances from snv sites did not exhibit any regularities the distribution of different nucleotides on distance 1 left to snv sites 1 did exhibit significant difference from their overall percentage in the dataset the corresponding right 1 distance distribution of nucleotides is almost uniform table 2 figure s7 represents differences between the percentage of nucleotides at a given position and in the whole genome for up to the distance 10 left and right from snv sites figures s8a and b represent distribution of substitutions preceded by different nucleotide bases and followed by different nucleotide bases respectively it can be seen that on the ct substitutions both ct and tc are favored by the preceding a and the following  almost 40 of all the ct substitutions figure 2 while the substitution tc is almost prohibited by the preceding t only 3 clustered substitutions of length 2 are rare eg tcaa gaca analysis of distribution of individual nucleotides over the three codon positions in annotated orfs of all the annotated isolates showed that except for short proteins such as e m and presumptive orfs all the codons exhibit the same tendency of t nucleotide dominating at the third codon position and the g nucleotide dominating at the first codon position while a and c appearing more often at the second codon position than elsewhere figure s9 represents distribution of nucleotides over the three codon positions in individual orfs and in total analysis of codon usage demonstrated the same facts as the distribution of nucleotides over the three codon positions in total the third nucleotide favored t 4010 over a

codon position only the above was true for the orf lab s and n proteins but not for another two structural proteins e and m the codon usage for sars-cov genome proteins is represented by table s3 and it is consistent with the results obtained for another human cov genome hcov-nl63 32 besides the number of snvs isolates differed in positions of snvs too table s4 represents positions where two or more snvs occurred for all the annotated isolates along with nucleotides and orfs based on hsr 1 annotation type of mutation transitiontransversion aa position in orf aa change aa property change and nucleotide position in codon positions of multiple snvs have been chosen in order to reduce the chance of erroneously determined snv there were 91 such snv sites with 288 snvs it is interesting to notice that there were no multiple base substitutions more than two different bases in any of these positions there were 227 transitions at 75 sites and 61 transversion at 16 sites out of which 5 were in structural proteins 2 in s 2 in e and 1 in m proteins the most common mutation was ct mutation 45 sites or 50 followed by ag 30 sites at and gt 7 sites each and ca 2 sites there was no mutation of the type cg there were 28 snv sites corresponding to the first codon position 20 transitions and 8 transversions 2 of which representing silent mutation sites ct leu there were 33 snv sites corresponding to the second codon position 31 transitions and 2 transversions all of which cause aa change there were 30 snv sites corresponding to the third codon position 25 transitions and 5 transversions 29 of which representing silent mutation sites the only non-silent one is gt leu  phe there were 31 synonymous multiple substitution sites and 60 non-synonymous ones with substitution rate 031 9129228 and non-synonymous substitution rate 021 which is consistent with the corresponding findings for 17 sasr-cov isolates 33 the number of multiple substitutions was for about 30 lower than the number of the overall substitutions and so were the substitution rate and non-synonymous substitution rate table s5 summarizes the above findings it represents the number of transition and transversion sites and the number of snvs in the form n1n2 per position in codon and per mutation type as well as the percentage of snvs and the number of silent mutation sites and silent snvs concerning non-synonymous sites 35 are within pp lab 5 within orf 3 1 within e protein 3 within m protein 1 within orf 6 1 within orf 8a 1 within orf 8b 1 within n protein and 11 within s protein only for two-or-more substitution sites and only in annotated isolates the s protein is of particular interest for mutation analysis being the key for host range determination multiple sequence alignment of the s protein in all the 96 sars-cov isolates showed that five of them namely zmy 1 sinp2 sinp3 sinp4 and sin3408l had large discrepancies with all the others due to individual insertions or deletions in them since such significant mismatches in the s protein sequence seemed to be the result of erroneous sequencing we eliminated these five isolates and analyzed the s protein in the remaining 91 isolates there were 34 isolates without snvs in the s protein tw2-tw11 sino3-ll as lc1 whu twc3 pumc01-pumc03 cuhk-ag01 cuhk-ag3 taiwan tc1-3 twc sin2748 sin2500 sin2677 cuhk-su10 hku-39849 twh twj twk twy and hsr 1 there were 62 snv sites with 208 snvs in total and no multiple mutations table s6 represents snv sites and all the snvs in the s protein of the 91 isolates along

overlap with the results reported in song et al ref 7 concerning snvs with multiple occurrences in 103 s protein genes some of which being nucleotide-identical with 80 in common with our dataset and are consistent on the intersecting data table 3 summarizes the results from table s6 out of 62 snv sites 19 were observed to be synonymous with 58 synonymous snvs in total and 43 were observed to be non-synonymous substitution sites with 150 non-synonymous snvs in total table s6 substitution rate was 165 623768 and non-synonymous substitution rate was 114 433768 which is consistent with findings for the whole genome in the enlarged dataset and is about three times higher than the corresponding findings for 17 isolates in bi et al ref 33 22 substitution sites 13 non-synonymous substitution rates 058 035 respectively as represented on figure 4 most non-synonymous aa substitutions are located in external domain ed 14 of non-synonymous substitution are in rbd 3 of them in the most narrow intersecting range as it concerns epitopes 40 of non-synonymous aa substitutions are located in overall epitope domains determined by various researchers finally one non-synonymous aa substitution is located in transmembrane domain tm and two in internal domain id the coefficients ks number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site and ka number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site were calculated for all the 91 s proteins in the dataset to be ks  000135 ka  000103 and the ratio kaks had the value 07629  1 which may be interpreted as evidence for the s protein not being subjected to the darwinian selection these findings are consistent with the similar analysis performed for 20 sars-cov isolates by hu et al 35 giving the ratio value of 065 values of the corresponding coefficients and the ratio kaks for the 89 human patient isolates only present even stronger evidence of the s protein being subject to negative selection ks  000121 ka  000080 kaks  0661 the coefficients ka ks and the kaks ratio for all the human patients isolates and each of the palm civet isolates as the outgroup are represented in table 4 these values indicated that the s gene was subjected to the darwinian selection during virus evolution transmission from animals to humans which is consistent with the analysis performed by yeh et al 36 for 28 human isolates and the sz3 palm civet as the outgroup giving the corresponding ratio value of 1657 and with the analysis performed by he et al 8 indicating that the s gene showed the strongest positive selection pressures initially with eventual stabilization phylogenetic tree drawn using the phylodraw program for the clustal x output of aligning the 96 isolates is represented in figure 5 its close relationship to the classification proposed in the paper suggests that classification of sars-cov isolates might be obtained by applying the computational analysis based on genome polymorphism all the isolates were classified according to their genome polymorphismsnvs and indels the procedure being proposed in our previous paper 57 since snv contents turned out to be a more distinguishable property than the presence of indels as the first classification criterion we took the number and positions of snvs for the profile isolate as the referent isolate number of snvs for different isolates varied from 0 hsr 1 as to 78 zmy 1 table 1 all the isolates were classified into two groups based on the number of snvs with the profilethose with less than or equal to 11 snvs and those having more than 11 snvs thus the first classification criterion resulted in two groups table 1 group aisolates with less than or equal to 11 snvs tables 1 and s2 group bisolates with more than 11 snvs relative to the profile isolate positions of snvs moved several isolates between the two groups sod from b to a since the most of its snvs are in 3 utr cuhk-w1 from a to b since its number of snvs with the profile of the a group is larger than the one of the b group whu from b to a gz50 from a to b gd69 from b to a and gz-c from b to a the second classification criterion was presence and position of long indels inside the basic a b groups we identified the following subgroups a2 b2subgroups of the a b groups respectively with long insertions a2 remained empty while b2 contained 8 isolates with 29-nt insertions a3 b3subgroups of the a b groups respectively with long deletions a3 group consisted of 3-isolate subgroup lc2 lc3 and lc5 with a deletion of length 386 sin852 with a deletion of length 57 2-isolates subgroup gz-b and gz-c with a deletion of length 39 sin849 deletion of length 49 embedded and sin846 137 overlapping b3 subgroup consisted of the isolates zs-a zs-b and zs-c with the deletion of length 53 a4 and b4 were the subgroups with many individual indels table 1 the rests of the a b groups were denoted as a1 and b1 respectively it can be noted that proposed grouping of 96 isolates based on snv and indel contents conserved the earlier classification t-t-t-tc-g-c-c 38 and partially coincided with the extension of this classification 39 40 the four loci 9404 17564 22222 and 27827 as the basis for this classification fitted nicely into our grouping basically a1 group coincided with t-t-t-t type while b1 group coincided with c-g-c-c type expressing two inter-types t-g-c-c isolates gz50 hzs2-d hzs2-e hzs2-c hgz8l2 hsz2-a ns-1bj04 hzs2-fc hzs2-fb and tjf and c-g-t-t isolates shanghaiqxc1 and shanghaiqxc2 figure 5 we found that another five loci which are among the most represented snvs loci positions 3852 9479 11493 21721 and 26477 figure 1 further refined our classification providing for sub-classification of the basic types there were two basic nine-locus types ttttttcgg and cgccttcat mostly coinciding with the a1 b1 groups and the two inter-groups an inter-a-b-group had the inter-type tgccttcgt and a subgroup of the group b1 two shanghai isolates represented another inter-type cgttttcgt figure 5 the proposed extension to the two main sequence variants tttt cgcc for an enlarged set of isolates is in accordance with the new insights into possible epidemiological spread both in space and time 36 38 41 namely positions 3852 and 11493 differentiated between the two subgroups of the group a1 all of the tttt type taiwan epidemic

loci for all the isolates is given in table 1 and figure 5 as compared to genotype clustering of sars-cov covering the epidemics from 2002 to 2004 7 8 it can be noticed that the grouping we proposed was at most in accordance with it namely the following correspondence between the two grouping schemes may be established firstly genotype class cgcctccat covering b2 and b3 subgroups corresponded to

showing a high degree of accordance among the proposed grouping and the phylogenetic relationships exceptions represented the two isolates of the b4 group with large number of snvs and individual insertions zmy 1 zj01 as well as the two isolates of the bl group shanghai qxc1 and qxc2 all of which being at large root-distances figure s10 nucleotide sequences of 103 sars-cov complete genomes were taken from the pubmed ncbi entrez database httpwwwncbinlmnihgoventrez in genbank and fasta formats since there were 7 pairs of nucleotide-identical isolates we considered the dataset to consist of 96 isolates tables 1 and s1 all the sequences are between 29013 shanghaiqxc2 and 29767 sin3408 in length out of all 19 sequences have ambiguous nucleotide codes ie n m r y w k s table si out of 96

cuhk-su10 pumc01 pumc02 pumc03 of length 231 except for sino1-11 of length 228 nucleotides 1 isolate does not have the m protein cuhk-su10 of length 666 nucleotides out of 42 annotated isolates 13 have 5 utr and 12 have 3 utr determined all the isolates are human sourced except for two isolated from palm civet paguma larvata sz3 and sz16- the clustal x program version 183 42 has been applied to all the isolates from the dataset the overall clustal x output had length of 29903 nt then 5 utr and 3 utr were identified based on positions in annotated isolates coding region encompassed the interval 301 29528 and had the length of 29228 nt we developed a program in perl language for analysis of a clustal x output the program first calculated an average isolate the so called profile by counting for each position in the clustal x output the number of occurrences of each different letter including dash and by choosing the most represented one positions containing dashes in the profile are called empty positions all the others being non-empty ones the program then counted snvs indels and calculated their absolute and relative positions for every isolate with respect to the profile and for different genome regions orfs 5 utr 3 utr and igrs substitution rate for the sars-cov genome and for the s protein for all the sequences in the dataset was calculated by dividing the total number of snv sites by the length of the corresponding nucleotide sequence non-synonymous substitution rate for the s protein was calculated by dividing the total number of non-synonymous snv sites by the length of the s protein the entropy of each site has been calculated based on number of snvs at that site in order to estimate the sites conserveness if we denote by pbprobability of occurrence of the nucleotide b b being a c g or t and under assumption of sites being independent we calculated the entropy of positions by the following formula 43 e  - sum p6 logp6 sum over b in this definition pb logp6 is taken to be zero if p6  0 the first type of classification was performed the same way as in pavlovic-lazetic et al 37 it is based on genome polymorphism snvs and indels the distribution of isolates per snv numbers outside 5 3 utrs was analyzed and the isolates were primarily classified into two groupsisolates with small number of snvs and isolates with large number of snvs the isolates close to border were further tested on the number of snvs against the profile isolates of each of the two groups resulting in some isolates changing the group a sub-classification was then performed on the presence of long or short indels inside each of the two groups the second type of classification was performed based on contents of the most represented snv sites except for earlier identified positions 9404 17564 22222 27827 classifying isolates into ttttcgcc genotypes 38 39 some other positions genotypes were identified as potential bases for sub-classification in order to compare the two classification schemes developed with the existing programming systems for phylogenetic analysis phylogenetic bootstrapped tree was produced using clustal x program and the neighbor joining nj method the nj method as well as parsimony and the probabilistic models produces unrooted trees in order to produce the consensus tree bootstrapping is performed with random number generated seed 111 and number of trials in bootstrap 1000 the tree is drawn using the phylodraw program 44 and the proposed classification schemes were mapped onto it all the s protein sequences those extracted from annotated isolates and the others we annotated using the publicly available program from pubmed tools for data mining httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgorfgorfhtml have been aligned using clustal x program then the s protein was analyzed using the same methods as for the complete isolates non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per non-synonymous site ka and synonymous nucleotide substitution per synonymous site ks were calculated using the dnasp 40 program 45 it is based on a method defined by nei and gojovori 46 that estimates the numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions between two dna sequences by counting the number of such substitutions in the corresponding pairs of codons it also takes into account different evolutionary pathways between pairs of codons the dnasp program may run with or without an outgroup the ratio kaks is considered as a selection parameter kaks  1 is usually interpreted as an indicator of positive selection the coefficients ka ks as well as the ratio kaks were calculated first for the s protein in all the isolates in the dataset without an outgroup since among the 91 isolates there were 89 human patients isolates and 2 palm civet isolates sz3 sz16 we then calculated the ka and ks coefficients and the ratio kaks for the 89 human patients isolates only without an outgroup too eventually we ran the program for all the human patients isolates and each of the palm civet isolates as the outgroup in order to test the hypothesis that the s gene was subjected to positive selection during virus transmission from animals to

 ein wichtiges kriterium bei der diagnostik von harnwegsinfektionen ist die quantitative keimzahlbestimmung  galt frher ein nachweis von 105 keimenml als entscheidendes kriterium fr den nachweis einer aktiven infektion so gelten mittlerweile bereits niedrigere keimzahlen ab 103 fr bestimmte klinische symptome und patientengruppen als schwellenwert fr eine klinisch signifikante bakteriurie insbesondere beim nachweis typischer uropathogene in reinkultur der nachweis von leukozyten erhrtet die diagnose eine bersicht zeigt tab 82 

 bei nachweis von drei oder mehr uropathogenen keimen sollte die diagnostik wiederholt werden mehrere erreger in hoher keimzahl knnen jedoch bei rezidivierenden oder chronischen harnwegsinfektionen ebenso wie bei patienten mit regelmiger einmalkatheterisierung  z b bei querschnittslhmung tiologisch relevant sein die kontaminationsrate ist nicht so hoch wie bei der gewinnung von mittelstrahlurin als verdchtig gelten keimzahlen zwischen 103ml und 104ml der nachweis von 104 koloniebildenden einheiten pro milliliter gilt als infektionsnachweis bei nachweis von kontaminanten ist eine erneute einsendung sinnvoll hufig wird nur die besiedlung des systems nachgewiesen was zu hufigem erregerwechsel und mischkulturen in den mikrobiologischen befunden fhrt die interpretation sollte stets die klinik und laborvernderungen mit bercksichtigen im zweifelsfall sollte vor beginn einer antibiotikatherapie eine blasenpunktion durchgefhrt werden bei adquater entnahmetechnik sollte punktionsurin steril sein deshalb gilt jeglicher keimnachweis als relevanter erreger der im labor entsprechend differenziert wird kontaminationen durch hautflora bei nicht sachgerechter hautantiseptik sind mglich gegebenenfalls ist eine wiederholung erforderlich da erkrankungen des magen-darm-trakts mit den symptomen erbrechen und durchfall sehr unterschiedliche ursachen haben knnen ist eine abgestufte stuhldiagnostik sehr sinnvoll sie orientiert sich an folgenden kriterien

 der nachweis enteropathogener mikroorganismen im stuhl ist bei gegebener klinischer symptomatik stets als relevant anzusehen beim nachweis fakultativ enteropathogener bakterien wie p aeruginosa hngt die bewertung von der klinischen symptomatik und den mikrobiologischen befunden ab sind nur geringe mengen dieser keime nachweisbar ist eine pathogene bedeutung in der regel nicht anzunehmen treten sie jedoch als weit berwiegender keim auf und scheiden andere ursachen aus sollten sie als erreger in betracht gezogen werden 
clostridium-difficile-erkrankungen werden ber den toxinnachweis im stuhl diagnostiziert dieser ist als pcr oder antigen-elisa direkt aus dem stuhl oder ber eine kultur mglich der toxinnachweis aus dem stuhl ist sehr spezifisch der antigen-elisa weist jedoch einige schwchen bei der sensitivitt auf daher sollte als suchtest im antigen-elisa der glutamatdehydrogenase-gdh-nachweis erfolgen der eine hohe sensitivitt aufweist ist dieser test positiv muss jedoch ein toxin ab-elisa oder eine entsprechende pcr angeschlossen werden da die gdh als gemeinsames antigen auch bei nicht toxinproduzierenden c difficile und anderen clostridien nachweisbar ist falsch-positive blutkulturen machen 3050  aller positiven blutkulturen aus und knnen zu nicht gerechtfertigten therapien mit mglichen unerwnschten arzneimittelwirkungen uaw fr den individuellen patienten fhren und verursachen unntige kosten fr die einordnung des mikrobiologischen befunds ist die beachtung folgender punkte wichtig

nachweis dieser erreger in nur einer von mehreren blutkulturen macht eine kontamination wahrscheinlichnachweis in mehreren blutkulturen erhht die wahrscheinlichkeit fr einen relevanten erregernachweis desselben erregers in anderen klinischen materialien z b im urin bei urosepsis spricht fr relevanten keimzeit bis zur positivmeldung des blutkulturautomaten hufige schnell wachsende mikroorganismen wie enterobakterien staphylokokken enterokokken erzeugen in der regel innerhalb der ersten 24 h eine positivmeldung
 bei einem pltzlich auftretenden septischen krankheitsbild das in zeitlichem zusammenhang zur intravensen gabe von infusionen medikamenten oder blutprodukten steht sollte an die mglichkeit einer kontamination des infusats gedacht werden der gleichzeitige nachweis desselben erregers aus dem infusat und einer peripher gewonnenen blutkultur ist beweisend die kulturelle labordiagnostik nimmt eine gewisse zeit in anspruch in der eine diagnostische unsicherheit besteht um den nachweis relevanter erreger zu beschleunigen wurden neue methoden etabliert

 fr andere spezies ist dieser schwellenwert nicht evaluiert klinisch relevante spezies wie s aureus enterokokken und gramnegative enterobakterien werden auch unterhalb des schwellenwerts identifiziert und ein antibiogramm erstellt bei bereits lnger einliegenden kathetern spielt die intraluminale besiedlung eine wichtige rolle bei der entstehung nosokomialer infektionen in diesen fllen sollte daher die innenseite durch splen des katheters mit nhrbouillon oder durch das ablsen der bakterien mittels vortex- oder ultraschallbehandlung untersucht werden anschlieend erfolgt eine quantitative keimzahlbestimmung als schwellenwerte ab denen bei entsprechender klinischer symptomatik eine katheterinfektion wahrscheinlich ist gelten

 es sollten zu einem zeitpunkt proben aus einem zentralen katheter und aus einer peripheren vene entnommen werden im labor erfolgt die zentrifugation das konzentrat wird anschlieend auf nhrmedien berimpft und nach bebrtung quantitativ analysiert eine mehr als 5-fach erhhte anzahl bereinstimmender keime in der zentral entnommenen probe gegenber der peripheren probe gilt als hinweis fr eine katheterassoziierte infektion bei subkutan getunnelten kathetern z b hickman broviac gilt der nachweis von 100 kbeml in der zentralen probe bereits als hinweis fr eine katheterinfektion ohne dass die periphere probe bercksichtigt werden muss hier werden ebenfalls zu einem zeitpunkt blutkulturen zentral aus dem katheter und aus einer peripheren vene durch punktion gewonnen die flaschen werden im labor in einem teilautomatisierten blutkulturdetektionssystem bebrtet und bei mikrobiellem wachstum als positiv gemeldet dabei wird die zeit vom einsetzen der flasche bis zur positivmeldung dokumentiert wird  bei identischem erreger  die flasche mit der zentral entnommenen probe mehr als 2 h vor der peripher entnommenen probe positiv so ist eine katheterassoziierte infektion wahrscheinlich die untersuchungen des liquors hinsichtlich zellzahlen glukose und laktat helfen zur ersten diagnostischen einordnung des infektionsgeschehens tab 83

 eine routinemige anwendung der bakteriellen latexagglutinationstests bei makroskopisch und mikroskopisch unaufflligen liquorproben ist nicht zielfhrend die strke der tests liegt vielmehr darin eine mikroskopisch gestellte verdachtsdiagnose zu untermauern die nutzung von nukleinsueamplifikationsverfahren ist insbesondere bei viren und zum nachweis schwer identifizierbarer bzw anzchtbarer oder langsam wachsenender erreger von groer bedeutung der nachweis mikrobieller dna bzw rna im liquor spricht bei entsprechender klinischer symptomatik fr eine erkrankung durch den erreger die eingesetzten pcr-verfahren sind bis heute wenig standardisiert und werden daher von zahlreichen mikrobiologischen laboratorien nicht angeboten die probe wird dann an entsprechende referenzlaboratorien weitergeleitet die vermehrung von bakterien pilzen und viren mithilfe von kulturmedien kann in der regel relevante mikroorganismen identifizieren eine kontamination durch typische bestandteile der hautflora ist bei nicht sachgerecht durchgefhrter hautdesinfektion mglich die kulturelle anzucht ermglicht die anfertigung eines antibiogramms bei nachweis von hemmstoffen muss die mglichkeit falsch-negativer befunde in betracht gezogen werden die gleichzeitige analyse von serum und liquor erlaubt den nachweis einer autochthonen antikrperproduktion dafr ist neben der quantifizierung der entsprechenden antikrper auch die analyse von albumin erforderlich sodass ein antikrperindex berechnet werden kann wichtig ist die entnahme von liquor und serum zum selben zeitpunkt anhand der ergebnisse knnen aussagen darber getroffen werden ob die blut-hirn-schranke intakt ist und ob spezifische antikrper im bereich des liquorraums gebildet werden was auf ein infektises geschehen hinweist reiber-schema viele dieser erkrankungen werden durch eine bakterienart verursacht sie betreffen in der regel definierte hautschichten tiefe infektionen sind nicht selten durch aerob-anaerobe mischinfektionen bedingt die durch den relativen sauerstoffmangel ermglicht werden eine bersicht zeigt tab 84

 operationswunden werden im rahmen des eingriffs bzw kurz danach mit bakterien besiedelt einfache postoperative wundinfektionen verzgern in der regel die wundheilung und zeigen die typischen klinischen symptome einer lokal begrenzten entzndung bei der bewertung mikrobiologischer befunde muss neben der klinischen symptomatik der entnahmeort bercksichtigt werden koagulasenegative staphylokokken aus einer sternotomiewunde bzw nach implantation einer hfttotalendoprothese sind als potenzielle krankheitserreger zu betrachten wohingegen sie bei gemeinsamem nachweis mit enterobakterien undoder enterokokken in darmresektionswunden vernachlssigt werden knnen typische erreger postoperativer wundinfektionen sind staphylococcus aureus
 streptococcus pyogenes
und andere streptokokken enterokokken enterobakterien und pseudomonas aeruginosa
 schwere komplizierte wundinfektionen fhren meist zu einer beeintrchtigung des allgemeinbefindens und gelegentlich zur systemischen ausbreitung der infektionserreger dabei handelt es sich hufig um polymikrobiell bedingte infektionen an denen v a bei tiefen gewebeprozessen auch anaerobier wie bacteroides

 wenn bereits erwhnt wurde dass grundstzlich die richtige gewinnung von materialien entscheidend ist fr die aussagefhigkeit mikrobiologischer befunde so gilt dies fr molekularbiologische verfahren in besonderem mae es reichen zwar wenige erregerbestandteile fr die amplifikation aus was die methoden zu sehr sensitiven verfahren macht jedoch ist die gefahr der kontamination die zu falsch-positiven befunden fhren knnen nicht zu unterschtzen die ursachen falsch-negativer befunde sind neben problemen bei der technischen durchfhrung hufig in der pranalytik zu suchen 
zu wenig probenmaterial insbesondere bei erregern die nur in sehr geringer zahl in klinischen materialien vorkommen wie z b bei tuberkulose oder toxoplasmose im liquorungeeignetes probenmaterial

 neben kommerziell erhltlichen standardisierten testverfahren sind immer noch viele in-house-verfahren verbreitet die im rahmen einer diagnostischen anwendung ebenfalls validiert sein sollten in solchen situationen sollte ein enger kontakt mit dem mikrobiologischen labor bestehen um die mglichkeiten und einschrnkungen des jeweiligen testverfahrens bei der interpretation und bewertung der ergebnisse zu bercksichtigen bei der typisierung von mikroorganismen kommen fr unterschiedliche fragestellungen verschiedene methoden zum einsatz eine bersicht bieten mellmann und harmsen 2009 antikrper werden bei kontakt mit entsprechenden antigenen mit einigen tagen bis wochen verzgerung gebildet sodass sie in vielen fllen fr die akute diagnostik nicht geeignet sind aufgrund der einfachen materialgewinnung werden antikrperuntersuchungen jedoch hufig durchgefhrt und sind fr die beantwortung spezifischer fragestellungen auch sehr hilfreich grundstzlich kann beim nachweis einmalig erhhter titer oder eines mindestens vierfachen titeranstiegs von einem ersten oder erneuten kontakt mit den erregern ausgegangen werden auch die antikrperklassen sind abhngig von der jeweiligen erkrankung fr die differenzialdiagnostik von groer bedeutung in der regel werden bei akuten infektionen iga oder igm gebildet indikationen fr antikrperuntersuchungen sind

 bei der betrachtung von antibiogrammen und resistenzstatistiken ist die kenntnis und analyse intrinsischer und mglicherweise erworbener resistenzen wichtig primre resistenzen bestehen aufgrund des zellaufbaus oder der genetischen ausstattung der mikroorganismen solche primren resistenzen auf antibiotika werden in aller regel in mikrobiologischen befunden nicht aufgefhrt sie mssen dem anwender also bekannt sein so wird vancomycin bei gramnegativen bakterien nicht getestet da es die polymerisierung der mureinstrnge hemmt die ausschlielich bei grampositiven bakterien von bedeutung ist eine bersicht der wichtigsten intrinsischen resistenzen zeigt tab 812 

 
erworbene resistenzen beruhen in der regel auf einem der folgenden mechanismen und werden im antibiogramm mitgeteilt 
vernderung von zielmolklen z b verndertes penicillinbindeprotein pbp2a bei mrsa
berproduktion von zielmoleklen sodass die antibiotikakonzentration am wirkort nicht ausreicht um mikroorganismen in ausreichender zahl abzutten z b bei folsureantagonisteninaktivierung durch enzyme z b betalaktamasen mit unterschiedlichem wirkspektrum u a penicillinasen cephalosporinasen extended-spectrum betalactamase esbl carbapenemasennderungen der permeabilitt der zellhlle z b imipenemresistenz von pseudomonas aeruginosa
durch vernderungen im porinkanaleffluxpumpen  verstrkte ausschleusung von antibiotika z b von tetrazyklinen aus enterobakterienumgehung von stoffwechselwegen z b bei folsureantagonisten

 viele solcher sekundren resistenzen sind bekannt und plausibel erklrbar sodass beispielsweise beim auftreten einer chinolonresistenz bei e coli oder bei penicillinresistenz von s aureus keine weiteren diagnostischen schritte erforderlich sind in einigen fllen ist jedoch eine erweiterte z b genotypische untersuchung notwendig beispielsweise bei verdacht auf mrsa oder vre die sekundre resistenzlage muss bei jedem einzelnen antibiogramm bercksichtigt und sollte in regelmigen abstnden auch als resistenzstatistik vom mikrobiologischen labor zur verfgung gestellt werden diese muss dann von den verantwortlichen z b den hygienebeauftragten rzten in zusammenarbeit mit der apotheke und dem mikrobiologischen labor kritisch bewertet werden hierzu gehrt notwendigerweise der abgleich mit dem antibiotikaverbrauch in den einzelnen abteilungen sowie den in der einrichtung etablierten empirischen therapieempfehlungen treten vernderungen in einem der genannten bereiche auf mssen entsprechende anpassungen erfolgen dem personal mitgeteilt und umgesetzt werden  23 abs 4 infektionsschutzgesetz ifsg vom 20072000 zuletzt gendert am 28072011 fr die bewertung der antibiotikaresistenzen sowohl im einzelbefund als auch in der resistenzstatistik sind die in tab 813 dargestellten erworbenen resistenzen von besonderer klinischer bedeutung daneben gibt es seltene resistenzen die immer anlass fr weitere besttigungsuntersuchungen sein sollten

  triage of critical care resources in covid-19 a stronger role for justice lynette reid   some ethicists assert that there is a consensus in favour of maximising medical outcomes in emergency triage of absolutely scarce resources1 2 debate turns to the kind or kinds of outcome maximisation that should be adopted for example lives or life years1 2 and to whether the same principle also licenses resource reallocation3 equity considerations may be integrated into triage1 but only if they do not interfere with the goal of maximising outcomes

 should it be a commonplace should it apply to our response to critical care triage in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic decades ago we could contrast the ethics of clinical care with its focus on the good of a patient to whom the physician owes a special duty of care against emergency triage and public health ethics with their prioritisation of outcomes2 clinical practice is now shaped by considerations of good value care and the gap between clinical and triage ethics is less categorical in other allocation processes we balance maximising medical outcomes with various values in health technology assessment some form of values pluralism is reflected in multidimensional decision-making in many jurisdictions4 5 in organ allocation despite the absolute scarcity of a life-saving resource need still plays a strong role and equity considerations are taken into account6 public health ethics contrary to the claim of white and lo2 is informed by values beyond utilitarianism711 such as social justice and legitimacy in public policy the latter is particularly important when we are at odds in our fundamental moral commitments about values like justice and outcome maximisation triage of critical care resources in the sars-cov-2 pandemic shares some features with emergency triage and other features with resource allocation decisions in routine care the situation is unprecedented and we face momentary absolute resource scarcity however the current situation is also going to be a prolonged one public health has engaged the entire population in an outbreak response that fundamentally alters our day-to-day lives that broader public health response takes into account values beyond outcome maximisation a few countries new zealand vietnam12 and some countries of sub-saharan africa13 have maximised lives saved by immediately implementing containment the goal of most countries has been to keep the outbreak within expanded critical care capacity many countries are reopening despite ongoing community transmission furthermore the pandemic and our public health response expose disadvantaged groups to risks that raise justice concerns consider two persons one is a middle-aged person in good health with a life expectancy in their mid-80s who can work from home with full salary and no threat to housing security their home is spacious well ventilated with little pollution and they enjoy access to green space they can pay to have necessities delivered if they must have some contact with the public they can afford measures to avoid household transmission the second person is the same age but of lower socioeconomic status and works in precarious employment that cannot be done from home they have either been designated essential or they cannot leave work because they have no resources to sustain unemployment their housing is crowded with poor ventilation and no green space the pandemic increases their housing insecurity they cannot afford temporary shelter apart from their family the whole family faces a substantial risk of household transmission government financial assistance may provide some relief but it also saddles them with debt after the pandemic they rely on public transit to get to and from work and for essential shopping in many countries they are disproportionately immigrants or members of racialised minorities andor immigrant groups14 15 they are exposed to a greater risk of contracting covid-1914 16 for the very reasons that they are at greater risk of chronic health conditions that may lower their likelihood of responding favourably to intensive care unit icu or organ support in the case of severe covid-1917
 in the current pandemic maximising outcomes in critical care triage may compound the injustices of the social determinants of health and have negative implications for equity of racialised groups18 19 concern with these inequities is at least consistent with public health ethics if not also core to public health ethics decades of work in resource allocation about balancing equity and efficiency should be brought to bear on critical care resource triage in a pandemic

 the goal of maximising outcomes in the specific form of maximising lives saved seems highly morally plausible until one considers the unacceptable results of its pursuit at all costs decades of research into public attitudes and of ethical debate2024 have explored three forms of justice in tension with outcome maximisation i will label these forms of justice concerns as follows the egalitarian concern to give everyone a chance connected to a fundamental sense of human equality25 26 the non-discrimination concern to protect those at risk of discrimination and the social justice concern to address unjust health detriments whether relating to natural eg ability or age or social eg socioeconomic status or racialised identity categories i will also refer to procedural justice concerns and domain-specific fairness

 surveys of public and professional attitudes in the 1990s suggest that some persons are committed to maximising outcomes and other persons are committed to maximising equality by for example granting more livers in organ allocation to those less likely to benefit in order to improve equality of outcomes this latter commitment is consistent with our approach to disabilities in many realms and a positive argument for abandoning it in pandemic response if there is one must be made many people can be described as balancers who prefer distributions that give weight to both equity and efficiency2224 28 29 the metaphor of balancing as i use it here captures the idea that we resolve moral dilemmas by developing approaches that take into consideration multiple values each value retains metaphorical weight even when it does not dominate when we cannot do as much good as we should in some dimension we have responsibilities to limit and mitigate the harm this causes in balancing conflicting values risk and uncertainty come into play specifically epistemic uncertainty risk of bias and the moral irrelevance of small differences in risk for example in allocation dilemma research balancers were willing to sacrifice equal chances for all in order to save a greater number of persons but only where the difference in probability of benefit was substantial and where epistemic warrant for categorising individuals was good in the process of balancing competing important moral claims that could not all be maximised they wanted decisive rather than marginal considerations to tip the scale balancing considerations can also reflect an egalitarian concern that persons deserve an equal opportunity or deserve not to have their chance taken away because it is smaller than anothers that is a balancer might readily agree to prioritise saving the most lives if the choice is between a person who has a 10 chance of survival and a person who has a 90 chance of survival where the differences are smaller it is plausible to reason that the differences in survival probability between two persons do not justify a categorical difference in treatment for example a person with a 45 and one with a 55 chance of survival both deserve an equal chance at their marginally different possibility of benefiting from access to icu we may have reasons to be more or less sensitive to the size of difference in probability to benefit as it relates to concerns of discrimination fundamental human equality or social justice an epistemic metaconsideration that has long led people to adopt random selection by lottery

 or by using time as a natural but imperfect randomiser in a wait list or first-come first-served situation is that it is both difficult and time consuming to categorise persons in fair ways this is particularly difficult to accomplish under emergency conditions or conditions of competing resource claims when considerations of procedural justice and the possibility of appeal come into play the supposed efficiencies of acting to save the greatest number by applying defensible categories in a fair way may be lost contrary to the argument of emanuel et al1 balancing competing values in resolving ethical dilemmas does not render illusory our commitment to values that we compromise compromise across deeply held diverse moral values is essential to the legitimacy of pandemic policy in this approach medical criteria should be designed solely to maximise outcomes bias would be detrimental to those subject to triage and would also interfere with outcome maximisation insofar as social injustice occurs because of bias and discrimination non-discrimination also addresses some social justice concerns however it does not address all of them the consistent application of criteria that exclude people with health detriments that are due to the social determinants of health compounds existing health injustices neither does non-discrimination address the egalitarian or epistemic balancing concern that differences in probabilities must be substantial in order to dissuade us from treating everyone equally or from attending to social justice these are not reasons to reject unbiased application of medical criteria of course but reasons to think that this solution is an incomplete response to concerns of justice note that some concerns about discrimination are not about irrelevant criteria or inconsistent application of relevant criteria but about a predetermined idea of persons against whom it is impermissible to discriminate as johnson points out18 no one has proposed prioritising women over men for icu admission even where there has been evidence that men with covid-19 are less likely to survive the grounds for this in balancing considerations or in social justice concerns must be made transparent and consistent with other groups for whom discrimination is a threat another disadvantage is that consistent application of outcome-maximising criteria creates a relatively homogenous treatment pool such that poor prognosis becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as people with certain conditions are excluded from icu the opportunity for healthcare providers to refine their management of persons with these conditions is lost along with the opportunity to improve outcomes in this section i review several possible balancing solutions that reflect a willingness to sacrifice outcome maximisation for justice considerations one way to give weight to social justice considerations is to refuse outcome-maximising criteria that further structural inequalities that is outcome-maximising criteria could be adopted only where they are neutral in distribution among categories relevant to justice such as socioeconomic status gender and racialised groups triage protocols based on life expectancy or chronic multimorbidities may fail this test in relation to concerns about health inequities as would the use of quality-adjusted life years in relation to disabled persons if no such criteria can be found then we can move to random allocation by lottery or time another balancing approach would be to allow outcome maximisation to outweigh social justice considerations and fundamental egalitarian concerns but only where the distinctions we apply make a substantial difference and the categories are homogeneous enough to warrant discrimination among individuals note that the differences in odds of surviving critical care between groups are not 91

 preliminary uk data on critical care survival suggest differences of 1014 percentage points between risk categories including adjacent age categories17
 a third approach would be to use justice considerations to limit our choice of which outcome-maximising principle or principles to use some candidates are lives life years quality of life and fair innings adopting several outcome-maximising principles at the same time would further compound health inequities for example given a 10-to-30-year difference in life expectancy for persons of different socioeconomic status and different chronic disease patterns30 including life years saved or quality-of-life considerations in addition to probability of survival-to-discharge in critical care triage would doubly advantage persons who already enjoy a considerable health advantage we should instead choose whichever single outcome-maximising principle is least detrimental to social justice and to egalitarian opportunity since saving the most lives limits each persons claim to a maximum of one it is theoretically more egalitarian than saving the most life years a principle that allows one persons claim to outweigh another persons by much more another approach would be to place the most weight on pure egalitarian concerns in order to give everyone the same opportunity to have their existing chance within a reasonable range of chances this could be operationalised through randomisation by lottery or time the same approach could be chosen on the basis of epistemic considerations in circumstances where judgments of individual probabilities are uncertain risks of bias are high andor categorical differences in possibility of benefit are small it may be preferable to turn to random allocation social justice considerations should play a role in how we operationalise random allocation using time to randomise by wait lists or first-come first-served is more publicly acceptable than using a lottery but it is an imperfect randomiser

 healthier persons of higher socioeconomic status are likely to be more successful in seeking care and navigating systems than disadvantaged persons and will have more alternatives for care it is feasible for healthcare systems and providers to make judgments about for example delayed care seeking the availability of care alternatives the burden of returning for reassessment or a limited accessibility for follow-up care such an approach would also tie our response to health inequities closely to dimensions in which healthcare providers and systems can support disadvantaged patients non-critical care resources can be called on to assist in improving outcome potential for example by addressing gaps in postdischarge care or supporting home care to delay or prevent admissions19
 a solution that maximises both equity and efficiency without sacrificing either would be ideal one way to address the limitations in the avoid bias and discrimination approach discussed above has been proposed by schmidt31 and is permitted by emanuel et al
1 among those who meet the chosen threshold of likelihood to survive icu and organ support we could prioritise disadvantaged persons we would then in theory save the same number of lives but save more lives of disadvantaged persons this would be a form of affirmative action in medical resource allocation proponents point out that we may be able to save even more lives of the disadvantaged than we would on the balancing solutions canvassed above however this proposal faces two normative challenges from quite different perspectives first if we take this approach we will fail to remedy social injustice if we select healthy disadvantaged persons ones whose health is not detrimentally affected by the social determinants of health then we will not interfere with the way that maximising outcomes compounds the health inequities caused by socioeconomic or racialised inequalities we will save only those disadvantaged persons who have escaped the health effects of their disadvantage this can be described as awarding resources to those who share a feature that is proxy for health injustice but is not itself health injustice second this approach violates competing principles of domain-specific fair distribution if we take an affirmative action approach we attract the objection that access to medical care should be based on medical not social criteria
7
 we would also face feasibility challenges that support concerns about domain-specific fairness even if we reject the controversial idea that appropriate allocation principles flow from the nature of what is being allocated these include the preparation of healthcare providers and healthcare systems to discern the categories of social disadvantage in question

 data on race and ethnicity but not class are routinely collected in some health systems such as in the usa and not in others such as canada these data are collected for monitoring health system performance and enabling epidemiological surveillance they are unlikely to have the accuracy sufficient to inform life and death decisions for individuals consider the use of postal codes to support judgments of socioeconomic status based on neighbourhood income which would privilege gentrifiers if the role of racial ethnic or socioeconomic markers in affirmative action were known they would be subject to manipulation asking healthcare providers to distribute resources based on social inequities may increase rather than mitigate vulnerability to discrimination expecting people to triage against their own class identities may not be feasible addressing procedural justice concerns would readily swamp the efficiency gains that the proposal otherwise promises furthermore the proposal would achieve its goal only where triage protocols are categorical such that there is a group above a threshold chance of benefit but still too large for the available resources and further selection to maximise outcomes is not possible if further outcome maximising is possible using a scalar approach but that has been rejected then the proposal no longer demonstrates true outcome maximising2 empirically this group must contain enough disadvantaged persons such that preferentially selecting these persons will address the fundamental concerns of social justice raised by medical criteria that are designed to maximise outcomes proponents of affirmative action argue that it could achieve even greater benefits for those worse off than could the balancing solutions i have proposed in the previous section such that rejecting outcome maximisation and affirmative action would constitute levelling down for the disadvantaged themselves the argument is that admitting all of the disadvantaged persons who have escaped the health detriments associated with disadvantage could result in admitting more disadvantaged persons than would be admitted under a lottery that includes a broader group of both advantaged and disadvantaged persons who are on average less likely to survive however my normative critique of outcome-maximising affirmative action would still apply under this so-called levelling down scenario on this proposal we select those who have not experienced the health detriments of the social determinants of health this achieves at best an ambiguous case of levelling up its application in disability cases for example involves playing the interests of the healthy disabled against those whose disabilities imply greater health detriments or shorter life expectancy insofar as it does this it weakens the claim that those with greater health vulnerabilities or shorter life expectancy should see the persons who are preferentially selected as levelling up for a group with which they identify because only those with fewer health detriments are treated the problem of the self-fulfilling prophecy still applies and like the avoid bias and discrimination approach it does not address the egalitarian sense that differences in probabilities of survival must be substantial to override a fundamental commitment to human equality in this paper i have challenged the claim that there is a consensus in a pandemic emergency triage of scarce critical care resources that the value of maximising outcomes should dominate my argument draws on work in resource allocation and organ allocation where balancing multiple criteria is common i focus on concerns of justice specifically fundamental egalitarian concerns social justice concerns and non-discrimination concerns in addition to arguing that maximising outcomes is detrimental to egalitarian and social justice concerns i have also described balancing considerations that should come into play in resolving dilemmas competing values retain their weight even when they do not dominate they can set standards for evidence and limit the lengths to which we are prepared to go to maximise the value we think is more important they establish responsibilities to support those of us who are harmed by our failure to live up to values that matter to us in order to mitigate or compensate for these harms in addition to these general considerations in favour of balancing justice and outcomes in emergency triage there are considerations specific to the current sars-cov-2 pandemic that favour triage rules informed by solidarity with those experiencing health detriments arising from social determinants of health and compounded by racialisation furthermore it is not clear what in the current pandemic warrants abandoning existing societal commitments to inclusion for disabled persons this pandemic has required and will continue to require an enormously disruptive societal response with substantially inequitable effects we should broaden our focus beyond which form or forms of maximising outcomes are appropriate in a pandemic response we need to consider mitigating the health inequities of a global pandemic in critical care resource allocation and beyond  kunjin replicon-based simian immunodeficiency virus gag vaccines itaru anraku vladislav mokhonov v paweena rattanasena ekaterina mokhonova i jason leung gorben pijlman andrea cara wayne schroder a alexander khromykh a andreas suhrbier   a number of rna-based vector systems have been used in the construction of hiv-1 and siv vaccines these include vectors based on negative strand rna viruses 1 2 3 positive strand rna viruses such as sendai virus 4 coronavirus 5 and lentiviruses 6 and positive strand rna replicon-based vectors derived from alphaviruses 7 8 9 picornaviruses 10 and flaviviruses 11 replicon-based vectors exploit the ability of viral non-structural proteins to amplify greatly in the cytoplasm of infectedtransfected cells the replicon rna which encodes both the heterologous protein and the viral non-structural proteins this results in high-level expression of antigens and provides potent adjuvant activity via double-stranded rna replication intermediates 12 we have previously described a replicon vector system based on the kunjin virus 12 a largely non-pathogenic flavivirus found in northern australia 13 kunjin replicon rna can be packaged into virus-like particles vlps using a packaging cell line expressing kunjin structural proteins in trans
14 the resulting vlp vaccines are capable of inducing potent long-lived and protective cd8 t cell responses in several murine systems 12 15 kunjin replicon vlp vaccines encoding hiv-1 gag have also been shown to induce cd8 t cell immunity comparable to that seen after immunisation with recombinant vaccinia 11 in contrast to most alphavirus replicon-infected cells kunjin replicon-infected cells i do not show overt cytopathic effects so both double strand rna-induced danger signals and antigen production are maintained for extended periods and ii do not produce replication-competent viruses via recombination during vlp manufacture with recombination in flavivirus systems appearing to be extremely low 12 the evaluation of siv vaccines in non-human primates has proved to be an invaluable and enduring model system for testing new concepts in hiv vaccine development 16 17 18 19 most siv and hiv subunit vaccines encode gag as gag proteins are believed to be an important target of protective cellular immunity 20 21 herein we describe the construction and immunogenicity of four siv gag pol kunjin replicon vlp vaccines the first encodes siv gag using the wild-type nucleic acid sequence wt the second encodes siv gag using an rna-optimised nucleic acid sequence dx hiv and siv gag contain rna inhibitory sequence ins elements which have been shown to act at several levels to inhibit gag expression primarily via nuclear retention of rna in the absence of the rev protein rna-optimisation strategies which remove these ins elements by changing the codon usage result in significant increases in protein expression from dna-based expression vectors 22 and such rna-optimised siv gag vaccines have been used in a number of monkey trials 23 24 inhibition of nuclear export of gag rna by ins sequences is unlikely to be an issue for the exclusively cytoplasmic kunjin replicon rna however ins elements have also been reported to reduce rna stability and translation 25 26 the third siv gag kunjin replicon vlp vaccine encodes a human codon-optimised siv gag gene opt codon optimisation has been used extensively to improve recombinant antigen expression in a number of systems and the process involves altering the codon usage to the one most commonly utilized in a given species 27 28 the fourth vaccine encodes wild-type matrix and capsid from gag-linked in-frame to reverse transcriptase from pol gag-pol this approach has been described previously for hiv gag and removes from the gag gene sequences that encode proteins with potentially immunosuppressive properties whilst retaining sequences frequently recognised by t cells 29 although all four vaccines expressed gag protein at comparable levels they behaved quite differently in terms of immunogenicity protection and insert stability the rna-based kunjin replicon vector c20ubhdvrep sp6kunrep1 30 was used to construct wt dx and opt vaccines and sp6kunrep6 15 was used to construct the gag-pol vaccine these two

described and a range of largely vector-specific strategies have been adopted to limit the problem 46 49 50 51 52 53 in the kunjin replicon system deletion of inserted genes appears to occur in packaging cells during vlp manufacture for constructs with low insert stability the proportion of vlps without inserts increases if the time between rna transfection of the packaging line and vlp harvest is extended and appropriate reductions of this time period can result in vlp preparations with substantially fewer empty vlps unpublished observation these observations parallel those obtained for west nile replicons where vlps with insert deletions were also rapidly selected during serial passage of vlps in a packaging cell line 46 in contrast we have generated by antibiotic selection several cell lines stably transfected with recombinant kunjin replicon vectors and these could be extensively passaged without loss of reporter gene inserts 12 suggesting that insert deletion may be rare once a cell is transfected one might speculate that insert deletion is associated with the cellular stress that leads to the cytopathic effects which are observed in the packaging cells during vlp manufacture due to the high level of structural protein expression conceivably in such stressed cells replicon rna may gain access to the nuclear rna splicing machinery rna splicing is well known to be influenced by complex rna structure interactions with distant rna sequences able to regulate splicing events 54 why dx and opt vaccines would be more susceptible to insert deletion remains unclear but may be associated with the loss of native rna structures the dx gene was engineered to allow rev-independent expression from dna-based vector systems 23 24 however this did not provide significant improvements in antigen expression the negative influence of siv gag ins sequences on rna stability and translation 25 26 therefore do not appear to be significant in this system successful expression of wild-type siv gag by other vector systems where mrna is generated in the cytoplasm eg alphavirus replicons and vaccinia also supports the view that the major influence of ins elements is on rna export 9 55 the human codon-optimised kunjin opt construct did not result in significantly higher gag expression in vero monkey or bhk hamster cells suggesting that trnas are not particularly limiting in these replicon-based expression systems when tested in vitro why opt and gag-pol might provide slightly improved effector memory responses and wt and opt induce such poor central memory responses when delivered by kunjin replicon vlps remains unclear but is likely to be a reflection of multiple factors including the number of empty vlps in the vaccine inocula the level and length of antigen expression in vivo and the level of danger signals induced by the replicating replicon rna the better memory responses induced by the gag-pol vaccine may be due to the removal of the potentially immunosuppressive gag-encoded proteins 29 an alphavirus replicon siv vaccine with these regions deleted also showed improved longevity of t cell responses over full-length gag constructs 8 the high albeit variable central memory responses induced by dx may arise from increased levels of ifn produced 56 as a result of the large number of empty vlps that compromised 80 of the vlp inocula for this vaccine preparation table 2 the a20-egfp-siv gag challenge model fig 5 represents a new model for testing the effectiveness of t cell induction by siv gag vaccines this model is likely to represent a measure of siv gag-specific cd8 t cell activity as rejection of this tumour has previously been shown to be cd8 t cell dependent 57 protection from this model also correlated well with the magnitude of ex vivo elispot effector memory responses rather than cultured elispot central memory responses induced by each of the kunjin siv vaccines this might be expected since tumours are generally poor at stimulating the differentiation of central memory cells into effectors so prophylactic protection would rely on effector memory cells 58 the relative importance of effector memory andor central memory cells for prophylactic protection against hiv-1siv has not been extensively studied some evidence suggests central memory cells are more important than effector memory cells 59 whereas others have argued that effector activity early in infection when effector memory t cells would be most active is important for protection 60 and for slowing progression to aids 61 in summary we describe here a kunjin replicon siv gag-pol vlp vaccine which showed high insert stability good induction of effector and central memory responses and good protection against a model challenge other siv gag vaccines failed in one or more of these criteria illustrating that antigen construction and the inserts nucleotide sequences can have unforeseen consequences for the performance of these rna replicon vectors     liebe kollegen und kolleginnen in den hydrogeologischen notizen bieten wir aktuelle und fr einen groen leserkreis interessante mitteilungen damit das auch

fh-dggv anfang mrz noch recht optimistisch waren zwang uns die entwicklung des coronavirus sars-cov-2 mit steigenden fallzahlen und den gesundheitspolitischen rahmenbedingungen zum handeln allerdings lagen bereits zu dem zeitpunkt etliche stornierungen durch teilnehmer und referenten vor denen von seiten ihres arbeitgebers die teilnahme an greren veranstaltungen untersagt wurde viele beteiligte aber insbesondere ruth kaufmann-knoke und andreas musolff haben viel aufwand mhe zeit und persnliches engagement in die tagung investiert und ich selbst hoffte bis kurz vor der absage dass die tagung stattfinden kann wir haben eine verschiebung diskutiert allerdings ist aufgrund der langen vorlauf-und vorbereitungszeit fr die tagung mit langfristig erforderlichen reservierungen ein termin vor der tagung in 2 jahren in jena nicht rea-listisch auch die durchfhrung einer rumpftagung bei der eine groe anzahl an vortrgen keynotes exkursionen fortbildungen etc entfllt und nicht klar ist was stattfindet und was nicht war so unattraktiv dass wir uns gegen diese option entschieden haben auch bei einer absage der tagung bleibt ein groer teil der ausgaben bestehen die vorbereitung der tagung hat inzwischen hohe kosten verursacht ebenso die anmietung der kongresshalle der caterer sowie die anmietung von auerbachs keller fr das konferenzdinner diese kosten ohne die gegenfinanzierung durch die kalkulierten 450 teilnehmer bersteigen die finanzielle leistungskraft der fh-dggv leider ist es auch keineswegs so dass wir aus unseren finanziellen verpflichtungen ohne weiteres entbunden werden da die meisten veranstaltungsmglichkeiten langfristig gebucht werden mssen gehen auch wir als fh-dggv langfristige verpflichtungen ein wir versuchen selbstverstndlich mit dem caterer der kongresshalle dem auerbachs keller und den anderen dienstleistern eine kulante kostenregelung auszuhandeln es wird sich zeigen inwieweit das mglich ist und obwohl ihnen rechtlich die erstattung der tagungsgebhren bei der absage der veranstaltung zusteht haben wir alle teilnehmerinnen und teilnehmer gebeten zu prfen ob sie einen teil der tagungsgebhren als spende der fh-dggv zukommen lassen knnen oder durch den kauf des tagungs  unter dieses motto hat die un den diesjhrigen weltwassertag gestellt ein thema mit dem sich die kommunale wasserwirtschaft in deutschland bereits seit geraumer zeit beschftigt wie hans-hermann baas vizeprsident der allianz der ffentlichen wasserwirtschaft aw erklrt wir agieren nachhaltig und ressourcen schonend sowohl bei der gewinnung als auch der verteilung von wasser mit den millionenschweren investitionen in die infrastruktur hlt die kommunale wasserwirtschaft nicht nur die wasserverluste in den netzen bewusst gering sie sorgt zudem fr die sicherung der trinkwasserversorgung in der stadt und im lndlichen raum fr alle einwohner gleichermaen das ist eine beachtliche leistung wie die letzten heien sommer gezeigt haben angesichts des klimawandels fordert aw-vizeprsident baas ein klares bekenntnis der politik zugunsten der kommunalen wasserversorgung die nutzung fr mensch und tier muss vorrang genieen -ohne wenn und aber dieses klare bekenntnis wird nicht zuletzt im wasserdialog der bundesregierung durch andere nutzergruppen immer wieder infrage gestellt das ist fr uns nicht tragbar in den heien sommern der beiden letzten jahre htten die kunden in deutschland kaum einschrnkungen der wasserversorgung gesprt lediglich regional musste an sehr heien und trockenen phasen das rasensprengen teilweise zeitlich eingeschrnkt werden das ist der guten leistung der fachkrfte zu verdanken die kommunalen wasserversorger haben  ihre konzepte entsprechend angepasst sie haben den klimawandel als herausfordernde aufgabe aktiv angenommen und werden weitere szenarien prfen fhrt baas aus klar sei fr ihn dass das bewusstsein fr die begrenzung der ressource gestrkt werden msse -und das bei allen nutzergruppen bei den privathaushalten bei der industrie und auch bei der landwirtschaft wir alle mssen unseren beitrag leisten noch bewusster mit der kostbaren ressource wasser umzugehen fr baas gehre dazu auch dass die politik die nutzungskonkurrenzen um das grundwasser strker in den blick nehme nicht nur die men-ge sondern auch die qualitt msse langfristig gesichert werden dazu gehre die minimierung von eintrgen ins grundwasser da der groteil der wassergewinnung in deutschland aus grundwasser erfolgt ist die lokale nutzung gerade auch in zeiten des klimawandels mit dem zunehmenden wasserbedarf in spitzenverbrauchszeiten von besonderer bedeutung die lokalen vorkommen mssen nachhaltig in guter qualitt erhalten werden beim nitrat ist der anfang aufgrund des drucks aus brssel gemacht hier muss die politik konsequent weitergehen und die rahmenbedingungen schaffen die den eintrag ins grundwasser weiter deutlich reduzierenund zwar durch die verursacher hier darf nicht der wasserkunde einseitig belastet werden so der aw-vizeprsident zudem werbe er fr flexiblere lsungen fr die wasserwirtschaft um auch die bewirtschaftung in heien monaten in zeiten des klimawandels leisten zu knnen hier mussten wir erleben dass die genehmigungen nicht immer die notwendige flexibilitt aufweisen die der klimawandel mit seinen schnellen nderungen die wir in den hitzemonaten der letzten beiden jahre erlebt haben uns auferlegt um die spitzenverbruche auch weiter verlsslich abzudecken -so es das dargebot erlaubt - bentigt auch die wasserwirtschaft mehr flexibilitt der behrden auch das fordert der klimawandel ein  mein lieber

weitblick htte ich der ursel gar nicht zugetraut und europischer technologiekonzerne ein paar hundert unbewohnte griechische inseln zu energieproduktionsinseln umfunktioniert hatten es soll auch die

nondomestic farmed animals eg deer can reduceeliminate the need for shipping postnatal animals and thus has gamed the interest of the biomedical and conservation fields efficient movement of germ plasm worldwide requires established ctyobanks embryo cryopreservation has become a routinely successful technology for many species and efforts to develop usable cryobanks for many target species am ongoing recommended regulations for the movement of embryos from nontraditional ie other than domestic livestock species are nonexistent efforts are underway to establish domestic and international handling guidelines and to recommend suitable quarantine conditions to facilitate embryo importation further basic research on specific zona pellucida-pathogen interactions is encouraged to support embryo movement efforts  consideration of general guidelines and circumstances needing special attention to facilitate the international movement of embryos from laboratory animals and nondomestic species is timely and appropriate the groundwork for intematidnal efforts began in france when the office of international epixooties oie 23 based on extensive embryo-pathogen interaction research 8 30 31 32  established guidelines to address movement of livestock embryos the efforts of a group of scientists many of whom actively serve in the international embryo transfer society iets and its import-export committee and subcommittees were critical to the establishment of and later acceptance internationally by government regulatory officials of standardized embryo washing and pathogen testing procedures l2331 these have to be regularly updated based on research and risk assessment information 40 laboratory animals maintained in defined environments require practical but effective guidelines to facilitate controlled embryo movements fewer papers have been published on laboratory animals than on livestock species but the data strongly support the effectiveness of embryo transfer for eliminating microbial contamination 45 26 27  due to cost constraints and physiological limitations eg embryo availability of wildlife species it is improbable that the same degree of scientific investigation will occur before formulating regulatory policies developing and promoting standardized embryo handling practices for these nontraditional snecies will be discussed and a rationale for establishing effective guidelines based on the more limited information for nondomestic species will be orined da6 gathered for domestic species and some wildlife animal movement controls already in place may support developing guidelines and thus extensive embryo-pathogen interaction studies may not be necessary to meet regulatory requirements for the international movement of this valuable germ plasm ie embryos biomedical research demands and the need for embryo cryobanking laboratory animals in the rodentia and lagomorpha orders eg mice rats cotton rats guinea pigs gerbils hamsters rabbits play a vital role in biomedical research worldwide at the national institutes of health nih many invaluable animal models of disease and normal biological processes are maintained in the animal genetic resource nihagr for each of these species as a stock center for laboratory animals the nihagr routinely provides breeding nuclei to the biomedical research community and an embryo bank was established as an economical means to indefinitely preserve these rodent and rabbit genotypes embryo cryopreservation offers benefits for genotype management such as safeguarding against loss from disease reproductive failure natural catastrophe or genetic contamination in the future the cryobank will help minimize changes due to genetic drift by providing a resource from which defined genotypes can be periodically rederived this will allow for restandardization of foundation breeding colonies also rather than shipping postnatal animals cryopreserved embryos would offer a simpler more humane and easier method to transport requested models worldwide an equally important impact of embryo biotechnologies would be the prevention of vertical transmission of some diseases the nihagr

edition of the manual of the international embryo transfer society 31  shipment of cryopreserved embryos between research institutions although not yet routine does occur 20 36  this approach is expected to be the preferred method for transporting nihagr models in the future because the nihagr maintains small foundation colonies postnatal animals may not be available immediately banks of cryopreserved embryos will expedite requests expand distribution and facilitate the international exchange of these valuable animal models by better coordinating animal supplydemand and minimizmg the impact of environmental temperature on shipments a screen for pathogens especially zoonotics is a typical part of routine health surveillance of facility colonies documenting pathogens is necessary before the shipment of postnatal animals the health status of donor colonies is also a major concern for embryo shipments testing for the presence of certain pathogens at each institution would facilitate embryo transportation suggested agents to be tested for am listed below by species treuonema salmoneua a maenrginosa and coccidia embryo transfer technologies have proven effective in

when exporting clean embryos from a colony with a compromised health status to an existing clean colony at the importing institution colony management systems and health status must be considered before attempting to bank and rederive pathogen-free embryos these related factors determine both the complexity of the procedures to derive clean embryos and the quarantine strategy needed to ensure clean imported animals without compromising the health status of the existing facility colonies an outline of colony management systems is included in the guidelines to provide a baseline against which to assess the risk of acquiring importing or shipping exporting embryos this characterization of colony environmental conditions is a fundamental nquirement for effective embryo importexport activities worldwide the proposed guidelines 16 will suggest standardized terms to define colony housing conditions and the extent to which pathogens are present they will be based on the experiences of the nihagr to-date providing research animal models worldwide colonies are typically housed under conditions that can be placed into three broad categories defined flora conventional and undefined conditions defined flora typically would be germfree or barrier mom sterile facilities and the animals would have a pathogen-free or microbiologically-defined status barrier colonies may differ from germfree pathogen-and nonpathogen-free in that animals might be inoculated with a cocktail of a non-pathogenic microbial flora embryos collected from defined flora animals would be considered pathogenfree and would reauire the least restrictive conditions to ensum that clean embryos are available the recommendons for handling such embryos reflect those stated in the lets manual for embrvos of domestic species 31 but for embryos in this category the need for washing is mini - the health skus of the donor colony-must be documented in the cryobanking records so the importing institution can determine the quarantine requirements more restrictive measures am recommended for embryo recovery from conventionally housed not maintained in sterile conditions animals these closed colonies with a known health status would probably need to follow the lo-step washing procedure and other protocols outlined in the iets manual but incornoratine trvnsin treatment onlv if an enveloned virus is known to exist in the colony 30  qantineements would nd to be strickr than for defined flora embrvos due to the increased risk of contamination finallv colonies in undetkd flora conditions would include animals from the wild or with an unknown health status these would require the most restrictive embryo handling conditions including health testing the breeder male and the donor females use of a biological safety hood testing flush medium for pathogens lo-step washing possibly with trypsin treatment and quarandne in the importing institution following transfer of embryos these embryo handling guidelines 16  together with detailed records represent at this time the best approach to minimizing the risk of importing embryos contaminated with unwanted pathogens these may play a role in supporting the in-house need of some animal facilities and may in the foreseeable future be a requirement for exchange of animal models between institutions domestic and international complying with the guidelines can reduce the risk of acquiring pathogens but further investigation of embryo-pathogen interactions is needed the skill and knowledge of those collecting and handling embryos is critical to the success of this type of animal model exchange as well as advances in the technologies occur the guidelines should be modified to reflect the most current information the loss of genetic diversity in free-ranging and captive populations has increased the urgency for strategic plans to ensure long term species survival application of reproductive biotechnologies to wildlife populations may be beneficial for preserving this essential bit-and genetic diversity 28  the merits and strategies for establishing cryobanks for nondomestic species threatened or endangered by extinction have been detailed previously 37  germ plasm repositories will 1 interactively support species populations allowmg for the infusion of genetic diversity 2 enhance captive breeding efforts and reduce risks of disease transmission by utilizing ai embryo transfer and ivp 3 reduce animal numbers needed to ensure high levels of genetic diversity thus decreasing captive breeding costs and space requirements 4 transfuse wild germ plasm into captive programs without removing animals from indigenous habitats thereby providing insurance against epidemics natural disasters and socialpolitical upheaval 5 eliminate the risks and costs of animal transport and 6 provide increased access to rare specimens transporting healthy live animals can cause undesirable levels of shipmentassociated stress leading to an increased susceptibility to disease or death 11 19  in contrast the cryopreserved embryo suspended in a metabolic resting state is well suited to international movement following embryo transfer the fetus benefits from peri-and postnatal antibodies from the recipient that offer protection from local diseases 1 the development of strategies for semen and embryo banking as well as a greater understanding of disease transmission in wildlife populations am supported by various international conservation organizations 38 42  the spread of disease is of major concern 41 when transporting wildlife especially when the point of origin harbors pathogens such as rinderpest foot-and-mouth disease and theileriosis 19  incidents of disease transmissions by translocated wildlife were recently summarized 1941  futthermore the zoological community identitled high priority diseases at an international conference on implications of infectious disease for captive propagation and reintroduction of threatened species 6 the legal implications of managing captive breeding and reintroduction programs for endangered species also were addressed 7 in attempting to move animals health and welfare issues as well as controls imposed by the convention on international trade in endangered species must be considered many potential hazards of moving live animals can be attenuated or eliminated by shipping gametes or embryos it is generally believed that the potential for disease transmission via embryo transfer is much less than via semen ie ai or by the actual movement of potentirdly diseased animals 2930 washing procedures have been shown to remove many pathogens common to domestic and wildlife species from zona-intact livestock embryos such procedures also may prove effective for wildlife embryos the field of conservation biology unlike animal agriculture lacks the economic incentives to establish guidelines for obtaining and transporting wildlife embryos however as interest grows in the use of semi-domestic farmed animals such as deer and camelids 9 18  for agricultural production combined with an increased regard for species preservation the need for such recommendations is increasing regulatory officials in the united states department of agriculture usda import division currently consider gamete and embryo importations on a case-by-case basis karis ners comm the practices defined in the oie animal health code 23 for bovine ovinecape and swine ovaembryos will apply to all potential shipments of wildliie embryos strict sanitary procedures and accurate record keeping by a qualified team supervised by an accredited veterinary official are required categorization of wildlife diseases unlike those of livestock has not been attempted due to an absence of basic research but because of an existing permanent post entry quarantine ppeq policy for international live animal shipments such categorizations may not be necessary a few us zoological larks selected on a regional basis havebeen granted ppeq status before arriving at these zoos animals are quarantined pre-and post-shipment for disease screening and health status certification these animals am maintained permantly on the ppeq zoo premises but fl generation offspring 26 months old may be moved after appropriate disease testing routine preventative clinical and disease screenings are performed on the ppeq animals quality assurance programs including record keeping are implemented by a veterinary medical officer who makes periodic visits to the ppeq facility the current ppeq program provides a foundation for the international movement of nondomestic animal embryos this approach was successful in france where early imports of large numbers of bovine embryos under similar quarantine conditions proved effective in preventing disease transmission 34  embryo and gamete handling procedures and record keeping practices must adhere strictly to the iets manual 31 and must be supervised by an official veterinarian all nondomestic donor animals must be isolated and appropriate samples eg blood excrement tissue and nasal secretions screened for pathogens at least 30 days before and after gameteembryo collection embryos have to be stored in the exporting countrys quarantine facility 30-60 days until approved for export usda officials are also willing to consider semen importations using the above mentioned precautionary measures bovine herpesvirus-l bhvl might be eliminated from sperm preparations by serial washing 14  furthermore some believe that sperm transfected with certain viruses ie bovine viral diarrhea bvd produce embryos which degenerate before blastulation 13  representing an in situ control against transferring contaminated embryos these studies provide evidence suggesting that semen can be decontaminated unfortunately the current united states regulations do not accommodate ivm-ivf derived embryos generated from culled field sources 17 or acquired opportunistically from rare or endangered captive animals that die unexpectedly regulatory concerns arise from the unknown health status of the donor and the uossibilitv of intrafollicular transfection 2312 as a result standardized practices such k those commended for bovine ivm-ivf embryo production in the oie animal health code 23 are advised when cryobanking these potentially valuable samples pending future modifications in the regulations the development of regulatory guidelines to safeguard against disease transmission by livestock embryos resulted from extensive investigations of embryo-pathogen interactions conducted in the late 1970s and 1980s 8 30 31 32  while similar studies for many nondomestic species are highly unlikely due to limited animal resources and research funds studies using surplus wildlife eggs and embryos eg spare zonae pellucidae could provide preliminary data on the effectiveness of embryo washing and on zona adherence of selected nathoeens for examole investirrators at anriculture canada are evaluating zona adherence and pathogen transmissibility of ww to ova and embryos in free-ranging deer and elk and are collaboratine with usda on similar studies with foot-and-mouth disease singh per comm future technological developments may reduce concern about possible transmission of infectious agents with embryos and spermatozoa but meanwhile tissue and fluid sampling and storage should become a routine practice of wildlife scientists involved in applying art in addition to blood sampling of both patents flushing or follicular fluids and samples from serial washing steps should be stored for subsequent tests for pathogens for specimens retrieved from culled animal sources tissue samples should also be preserved and physical examination of the animal performed as previously summarized for free-ranging wildlife 10  non-transferable embryos and unfertilized oocytes should be preserved for future tests as well such projects are both realistic and practical and most importantly would provide an invaluable source of information if the approved importation of ivm-ivf derived embryos from wild sources is ever to occur such associated biological materials must be available by using the ppeq system it may be possible to conduct in vivo-in vivo studies in the future to definitively document the effectiveness of standardized embryo handling practices for the present however it is essential that scientists and embryo team vetetinarians using art adopt routine practices maximizing data collection emphasizing aseptic handling procedures and maintainmg detailed records as suggested in the iets manual 2931 and the oie animal health code 23  although progress is being made in species conservation biology using art 17 38 39  continuing research in the ama of gamete and embryo cryobiology is essential 28  concurrently it is vital that wildlife reproductive physiologists and veterinarians adopt stringent practices to avoid disease transmission via transported materials while adapting guidelines that comply with existing govermnental

that sound  at least on the surface  eerily like the present badiou 2020 thomas 2020 city road wanted to explore contemporary stories about the most recent pandemic through podcast so dallas and miles asked academic colleagues from all over the world to open up the voice recorder on their phones and record a twominute report from the field about their city that city road could broadcast on their podcastradio show the reports from the field were published under creative commons by the media organisation the conversation and we refer to excerpts from these public domain sources in this commentary you can listen to the reports from the field in full from httpstheconversationcomwhatdoesthecoronaviruspandemicsoundlikethevoicesofpeoplestrugglingsecludingandsurvivingaroundtheworld13553 many of those who responded to the call to submit reports from the field were struggling to make sense of their experience under covid19 in their cities the resulting stories reflected on morethanhuman cities social solidarity quarantine social control and the urban environment in cities around the world but we also discuss the themes of inequality positionality privilege and voice below new digital tools are increasing the speeds formats and breadth of the communication mediums that are available to researchers this has allowed researchers to collaborate in new ways and this podcast project pushed at the boundaries of what a research method and research community might be the sonic geographies literature shows social cultural and environmental sounds can be captured shared and processed by podcast producers in close to realtime gallagher  prior 2014 thus at city road we were interested in the ways that audio editing might be conceptualised as having analytical qualities that complement the more conventional analysis and textual writing up of research material a key claim here is that research outputs themselves can be sonic and textual and that the intersection of sonic and textual outputs can open up different questions and discussions about positionality power place and people gallagher  prior 2014 rogers  herbert 2019 themes we collectively explore below more broadly this podcast project fits within a genre of digital mediaacademic projects that aim to use sound and image to critically reflect on the nature of power and politics within cities the cities and memory 2020 project and the antieviction mapping project also see allegra lab 2020 offer different approaches to bringing a geographical sensibility together with sound the cities and memory project is a global collaborative sound  mapping project that covers more than 95 countries  where anyone around the world can send them a sound recording tell us a little about how things are wherever you live cities  memory 2020 they place these stories on a gis webbased map and invite others to listen to the sounds and read the stories on the map similarly the antieviction mapping project is a datavisualisation data analysis and digital storytelling collective documenting the dispossession and resistance upon gentrifying landscapes in san francisco bay area los angeles and new york city antieviction mapping project 2020 who partner with a range of organisations to analyse the audio material they collect and map such as oral histories graziani  mary 2020 in this case the audio editing suite is a key tool in the analytical process dallas and miles are interested in the idea of audio editing as a form of urban critique at city road too and so they asked people to send them mobile phone recorded audio clips about their cities when dallas and miles were planning their monthly episode of city road in march 2020 they were in the midst of the covid19 pandemic in sydney they discussed the role of academic experts in the debate about covid19 and cities to date such as academic experts radio commentary on covid19 and how academics might separate their expert role from their personal experience of being locked down in their cities and homes they suspected that this was a question other academics might have been struggling with at the time city road has always found the work of tanja dreher 2010 to be instructive at moments like these tanjas work reminds us that sometimes it is more important to listen to the stories of those in our cities than it is to speak at people about their cities tanja submitted an audio piece to the project in which she talks about the importance of listening at this key momentlistening for solidarity  is not an end in itself the aim is to listen for calls and cues to action this might be direct or indirect also to privilege and amplify the knowledge of those most impacted and most committed to social solidarity and to keep listening listening as a continuation keep listening to better understand how to work for more just futures beyond the contemporary crisis tanja dreher wollongong australia play audio

 with this in mind we asked academics from around the world to send us a report from the field about their city we wanted to know more about academics experiences as they confronted the many social political economic and material implications of covid19 in their city butler 2020 so we put out the following call on twitter to ask our academic audience if they would work with city road on this project as can be seen from figure 1 we did not explicitly ask for academic reports from the field on the topic of covid19 and cities but many contributors took covid19 as the context nonetheless in fact city road gave prospective contributors very little instruction at all choosing instead to allow contributors the freedom to experiment with the broad and purposely vague questions some participants asked for more clarity about the audio recording process and questions and city road offered advice on a casebycase basis for one contributor the wording of a followup tweet by dallas figure 2 made the opportunity to submit an audio clipa much less intimidating prospect  as it was immediate quick dirty and direct a snapshot of the city  i interpreted it as you seeking and us easily being able to assert our expertise about our everyday experience of our place  to which we could lay unique claim pill per comms
 a total of 25 academics1 submitted reports from the field recorded on their phones city road received well over an hour of audio content and dallas and miles decided to edit the audio material more than they had initially planned the audio reports from the field also operate as important standalone vignettes about cities under covid19 so city road provided them in full on the city road website

 as noted above city road gave the contributors a lot of freedom when it came to what their audio piece might sound like and a wide range of audio styles were submitted for example natalie says you almost discouraged sensemaking in your instructions  im thinking of how you told me not to overthink it osborne per comms some had no prior experience of podcasting but summoned the courage to go for it and to grab the opportunity of making sense of and reporting about their city alam per comms some of the contributions were raw and noisy others were academic and narrated and others were freeflowing but analytical in our discussions about this writing project carolyn talked about a difference between speaking as a civilian rather than academici was just focusing on what i was seeing and not seeing out my window it mapped well on eugenes framework which we discuss below but in that case i became so to speak a data point being fit into a postfacto theoretical framework whitzman per comms
 one of the more if not the most academically reflexive contributions to the podcast was submitted by eugene mccann other contributions ranged from more general freeflowing offthecuff observations to deeply personal reflections such roger keils keils contribution was recorded on the front step of a friends house while in lockdown and implicitly encodes his academic work on infectious diseasesi approached it in a nave way almost unthinking of the context the medium the potential audience i did it as an individual who stepped outside literally for the first time in the middle of a twoweek period of quarantine to speak into a phone despite the fact that i had spent more than 15 years since sars in toronto in 2003 studying infectious diseases in cities very little in my contribution was premeditated keil per comms
 beth watts talked about some of the contributions being personal and immediate watts per comms madeleine pill talked about the contributions operating as metaphorical sonic time capsuleswhat i find interesting is that it provides a snapshot of a moment in time  and enables you as a researcher to therefore travel back in time to reflect on your feelings and understanding of that time and how these have subsequently changed capturing the moment enables you to revisit it as a resource for reflection it also points to productive possibilities for longitudinal research  of how your own experiences and understanding of these changes pill per comms
 listening to others contributions can also lead to selfreflection perhaps even anxietyon listening to the edited version i was struck by the contrast between the academic and personal interpretations of the brief  should i have been more academic watts per comms
 we had two deeply moving contributions whereby tooran and deepti talked about the cities and people in the global south they care about from afarpeople like kurt and tanja who talked about people outside our academic bubbles and how this huge pandemic may impact their lives  and academics who talked about faraway lands iran and india to share the stories of people and places that otherwise would have been missed in this collection alizadeh per comms
 in fact all of the reports from the field blended academic and personal interpretations of cities under covid19 but these were expressed in different registers of orationi accepted dallass invitation not because i had done years of work on infectious disease or because i was a sonic geographer but because i was a captive in isolation in my own hometown but not at home speaking into my phone helped me find the ground i needed to stand on the terrain i needed to refamiliarise myself with keil per comms
 while everyone approached the report from the field audio recording task in a different way there was a shared view among those involved in writing this commentary that the podcast project was underwritten by our various positions of privilege and that the structural capacities of these positions enabled us to have our voices heard paul maginn who has written on qualitative methods posed a pertinent question after having reviewed the first draft of the commentaryis it the case that the podcast  the whole process from commissioning to publication  is in fact a methodological and empirical tool of 21st century academic praxis maginn per comms
 dallas and miles were keen to explore the methodological and collaborative possibilities of this potentially new form of academic praxis through the podcast project as the producers at city road dallas and miles were pivotal to the practical organisation of the podcast project and the conceptual organisation and presentation of the final podcast product dallas and miles initially positioned this podcast project as a collaboration but through our discussions via this collective writing project we felt that it was not a collaboration in the traditional sense of the term beth watts captured this point when she saida particular kind of collaboration  you guys were the lynchpin we havent had any dialogue as far as im aware between the individual contributors you have played an important curatorial role  worth recognising the specific kind of collaboration i think to involve so many people so quickly it had to be like this and actually at the time a more onerous collaborative process might have put me off given the other pressures watts per comms
 dallas and miles are interested in the sonic geography work of people like gallagher and prior 2014 p 268 which shows that audio recording produces distinctive forms of data and modes of engaging with spaces places and environments which can function in different and complementary ways to more commonly used media such as written text numbers and images there is an emerging body of scholarship on using radio and podcasting as a research method in media studies eg tomalin  crandall hollick 2002 rayner 2016 and in dallas and miles recent work they have argued that podcasting is being used in academia as an engaged research methodology as a research dissemination medium as a pedagogical teaching tool or as an assemblage of these rogers  herbert 2019 p 4 the city road brand as an assemblage of teaching research and dissemination is important to how dallas and miles organised and edited the reports from the field into the final podcast product after dallas heard eugene mccanns report from the field dallas asked miles who audio edited the podcast if they should use the four dialectical assemblages outlined by eugene in his piece to organise the rest of the contributions namely i invisibility and visibility ii privilege and privation iii selfishness and solidarity and iv absence and presence interestingly eugene said i was primed in what i said in the recording by the teaching id been doing and his four ideas went on to frame the podcastone of my favourite urban books is marshall bermans dialectical investigation of urbanism called all that is solid melts into air a key recurring device in the book is bermans use of the phrase and yet to complicate our understanding of what we think we know about cities there is never just one thing going on and we shouldnt assume that what we see is all thats going on  there is one thing going on in front of us and yet there is much more we cant see and none of it is permanent ive been thinking about cities as dialectical assemblage this week as vancouver has shut down eugene mccann vancouver canada play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t143
 the preface to the 1988 penguin edition of bermans 1982 pp 89 classic book readsone of my books central themes  is the importance of communication and dialogue  in a world where meanings melt into air communication and dialogue are among the few solid sources of meaning we can count on  we need to make the most of these possibilities they should shape the way we organise our cities and our lives
 bermans 1982 dialectical thinking on cities was characterised by an attention to the complexities ironies and potentialities of modernity broadly defined he was suspicious of narrow orthodox thinking and lamented what he saw as the loss of nineteenthcentury thinkers willingness to be simultaneously enthusiasts and enemies of modern life wrestling inexhaustibly with its ambiguities and contradictions and the replacement of that sensibility in the twentieth century with a lurch far more toward rigid polarities and flat totalisations he regretted open visions of modern life having been supplanted by closed ones bothand by eitheror berman 1982 p24 his attempt to retrieve the bothand approach leads him to repeatedly use and yet as a rhetorical device to undermine points he has just made and propel his narrative on to asyetunexplored interpretations figure 3 provides an illustration of how miles used eugenes four dialectical assemblages as drawn from berman as a means of thematically organising the audio edit and the submitted audio material in the podcast on seeing this visualisation of the audio editing process eugene reflectedi was also thinking about that screenshot and how it shows that editing sound is a spatialised activity whereas we maybe tend not to think about audio as spatial so does that softwares spatialisation of the audio across a grid have an impact on the way storytelling happens mccann per coms
 arguably a geographical sensibility is at work here at a number of levels first bermans ideas and theoretical insights were used by eugene to organise the insights in his audio contribution to the project second dallas and miles further used eugenes bermaninspired framework to organise the audio editing sessions and the presentation of all the audio contributions but not everyone was convinced of thisarguably this is a theoretical sensibility not necessarily a geographic sensibility i would argue that you dallas sought to find a framework to make sense of what you were hearing from different data points the fact that they were from different cities mattered less than they were from different genders ethnicities and in rare cases such as students or sessionals economic classes eugene contributed that framework just as a great quote from an interviewee sometimes frames an article whitzman per comms
 madeleine pill a city road listener further complicates the claim this could be solely understood as a geographic analytical sensibility suggesting that there were branding issues at play tooperhaps some recognition that you selected the contribution of a senior academic to provide the analytical frame for others contributions  used in an academic rather than personal way for the structure  did using this frame give you confidence about city road pods brand pill per commsthe answer is yes
 finally the soundscapes of cities often take on a familiar stereotypical aesthetic most people if asked what does a city sound like will most likely make reference to the sound of cars buses trucks trams trains and people in heavily trafficked and populated areas these cityscape sounds are representations of what we think cities sound look and feel like and city road were interested in probing if cities under covid19 sounded different as susan smith 1994 reminds us soundscapes enable us to foreground the relevance of experience and emotion in place miles allowed lots of space between the audio excerpts in the final podcast to allow the listener to listen to the soundscapes in each city we turn to the four key observations in the podcast next 
i think a lot about the sound of the city having changed so much plus and very much related the lack of people in our cities what is a city without traffic and noise and people a very uncanny weird eerie place its like a civilisation abandoned  not because the people have been driven out by war but because theyre hiding from harm in their homes strange strange strange sort of cinematic in its weirdness watts per comms
 what was fascinating about some of the reports from the field was that the covid19 containment measures had altered the soundscape of the city in some cases quite drastically as the following comment about an absence of familiar sounds in the city suggestsit emphasises what we have taken for granted in cities that they are peopled social places  but suddenly what we find is that the cities that we know are suddenly different  but it is not just a physical emptiness  but a quietness eugene mccann vancouver canada play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t311
 listening is important because there are significant structural and political questions at stake here this reporter from the field is listening to and engaging with the quietness of the city and this listening reveals an absence of people and other sounds that are otherwise familiar to this city the audio clip captures this quietness in a way that text cannot listen via the link above although as carolyn whitzman notedto be fair you asked for a quiet place certainly it was easier to find that quiet place in the covid city but  that will only reinforce the antidensity discourse that is emerging out of covid  ignoring overcrowding in homes due to insane rents and focusing on reestablishing the privilege of the quarter acre block whitzman per comms
 it is true there is a politics to the quietness of cities and that we asked contributors to find a quiet place to record nonetheless cameron murray reported from brisbane that his city was quieterits rather pleasant with a little more peace and quiet in the middle of the city but its noticeable the change it definitely feels a lot slower a lot quieter a lot less hustle and bustle cameron murray brisbane australia play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t455
 the sound of the city we hear throughout the broader podcast is almost defined by an absence of the familiar and this opens up the possibility for thinking about different futures the sounds of birds that are present in many of the recordings are not necessarily new to the city these birds have perhaps always been there however the social distancing and lock down measures have changed the urban soundscape in such a way that some reporters from the field could now hear these birds and spoke about hearing them you can hear birds the noise travels further because you dont have the hum and hisses of traffic on the streets jason byrne tasmania australia play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t2605 thus the familiar anthropocentric sounds of the city which are produced by the presence of people and their technologies in cities  such as people in cars buses and trains  are temporarily suspended and replaced by a new morethanhuman set of urban sounds these less familiar sounds are revealed through an absence in the soundscape of the city a sonic window perhaps into a different urban future where nonhuman forms of life can strive in new ways in our cities houston 2019 well yes says carolyn whitzman per comms coyotes have made it into my downtownadjacent neighbourhood our anthropocentric cities have been designed to allow people to occupy urban space in many forms from owning private property in the form of housing to separating children and adults through school and workplaces to congregating in a shared park at lunchtime to travelling on public transport to and from work as covid19 changed the city socially and structurally it was registered in soundin my soundscape you can hear me typing my toddler babbling my 9 year old practicing the violin and my neighbours daughter outside on her deck singing really loudly i recorded it in a moment of frustration i was unable to concentrate dombroski per comm play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser283789701kellydombroskisoundsofthehomeinaglobalpandemic
 dreher 2010 p100 argues that scholars and the wider public need to attend to the politics of speaking and listening because an attention to listening shifts the focus and responsibility for change from marginalised voices and on to the conventions institutions and privileges which shape who and what can be heard the transformation of parts of the urban soundscape from hustling and bustling to noisy and chaotic to quiet subdued and eerie also represents a displacement or reduction in the sounds of capitalismthe capitalist soundscape is exemplified by for example the thousands of people who travel into our cities each day for work or who interact with one another  socially and professionally  to the beeping of eftpos machines and the ringing of tills as people purchase everything from a coffee to designer clothing maginn per comms
 some scholars may see cities under covid19 as a relegation of neoliberalism perhaps there will be some kind of structural transformation but how deep and transformative that will be is an open question in the shorttermweve seen here pictures of people panic buying toilet paper and other staples in supermarkets large numbers of people still gathering on beaches and in parks not to mention incredibly distressing images of thousands of people queued up at social security branches trying to access desperately needed income support  were struggling with the effects on our members with the increased stigmatisation of communities of colour  who are being blamed for the transmission of the virus kurt iveson sydney australia play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t1330

 thus while this pandemic caused suffering for professionals including academics there were also classed racial gendered and other dynamics related to who can and cannot for example stay at home valentinodevries et al
2020 the urban soundscape as a fundamental aspect of society pointed to some of these structural issuesi was  reflecting on my privileged position two storeys above the street  i was contrasting it with folks who are still crowded in shelters longterm care etc whose health and safety is even more acutely compromised in the covid city whitzman per comms
 in the podcast beth saidi also saw four people begging on princes st i doubt earning very much money from that at the moment given the streets are so very empty and there were also either police or community support officers  speaking to some of them and i wonder if there is a bit more of an assertive response at the moment given concerns about people being out and about beth watts edinburgh uk play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t2015
 and like all structural conditions we made this podcast with multiple layers of sound from each city some of these sounds were brought to the fore while others were pushed to the background some can be heard by many people but others can only be heard by those attuned to them attuned to hearing their structural meanings these soundscapes are dynamic and temporal and will vary across time space and population eugene put it like this who is heard literally and figuratively in this city is classed racialised etc mccann per comms while carolyn saidthis podcast is great but again is it not the sonic space of privilege  those who have the technological education and equipment that allow them to share their stories does covid19 not further invisibilise or more precisely make more voiceless those who are on the street  under the bridges  without a political voice whitzman per comms
 information about covid19 was highly mediated and people were heavily reliant on the media for information about the pandemic people could not understand the pandemic through their own individual direct sensory experience alone thus it was a strange juxtaposition that voice was further removed from some marginalised people during the pandemic at the very moment they became more physically visible and exposed in cities

 during covid19 many people were unable to move through or gather in cities in the ways they had in the past and they were now gathering in different sonic domains in new ways such as though digital audio and video platforms such as zoom and using their voices and embodied sonic capacities to occupy the city in new ways around the world  perhaps more often in middle class neighbourhoods valentinodevries et al

 when research and other urban scholarship is represented in journals through text alone this form of scholarship does not account for the body or the sounds of the body harter 2019 p 126 harter 2019 p 126 argues podcasting stretches the tendencies and capacities of academics toward multisensorial forms of inquiry and this allows the sounds of the body to be more fully incorporated into the research process and outputs harter 2019 p 127 further argues that more conventional research outputs are often limited in their ability to register the visceral experience of suffering and resilience harter is referring to the participants of research in this quote but we suggest it might equally apply to those involved in this podcast project and we encourage you to listen to the audio links provided herein there were lots of references to the visceral experience of being in the city under covid19 in the reports from the field including this comment by kate murrayi can hear birds prominently usually the birds in this neighbourhood are drowned out by the footsteps and bicycle bells and cars trucks motorcycles construction sites but today its like the shutting down of all this industry and business the hustle and bustle is all swept away and its revealed underlying layers of sound that we had forgotten in the city kate murray melbourne australia play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t533

 over the course of the 30 minute podcast city road used sound in an effort to paint a somewhat textured soundscape for the listener to illustrate the changes taking place in cities around the world in developing and broadcasting this soundscape city road sought to offer an alternative take on cities under covid19 such that it would provoke peoples sonic and visual imaginations the empty and eerie sounds of cities that were at this moment in time often absent of people and technology revealed just how seriously everyone was taking the invisible threat of this virusthe church bells down the street have taken on a new meaning a kind of an eerie presence in a soundscape that has fundamentally changed matt novacevski melbourne australia play audio httpssoundcloudcomuser28378970147listeningtothecityinaglobalpandemic1t2841

 this critical commentary and the rapidly mobilised international podcast project that it reflects upon involved 25 academics from around the world city road asked academic colleagues to open up the voice recorder on their phones to create a report from the field about their experience in their city under covid19 the podcasting methodology presented here covers the curated production of the podcast and critical reflection on the podcast process through collaborative writing therefore this commentary was a key part of this broader methodological endeavour the methodology may seem unorthodox to some but it represents a development of existing qualitative methodologies eg digital storytelling collective writing and collaborative biography rather than a break from them put simply the podcast represents more than just an audio output as an exploratory curated academic project the podcast along with academic podcasting in general extends the methodological tools available to researchers to collect and analyse oralaural data alongside text it enhances the methodological tools available to us to understand cities within and beyond the context of a global pandemic a key lesson from this project is that some of the most insightful reflections about podcasting and cities under covid19 were produced through the collaborative writing process rather than through the production of the podcast this might not surprise qualitative researchers because the production of the podcast was highly curated by dallas and miles and they made all the editing decisions in the audio editing suite by comparison the writing of this commentary was described by some of those involved as being more collaborative analytical and revealing therefore each step in the methodology revealed different types of insights in the tightly controlled production of the podcast stage of the project  as with much qualitative research  the sampling strategy underpinning podcast production was purposive that is the primary aim was to elicit the experiences of a particular group or community and in this case city road targeted urban studies scholars again as with qualitative research in general the podcast does not lay claim to generalisability rather it provided explorative and situational insights at a specific moment in time from each contributor it was fortuitousness for city road that eugene mccann framed his contribution with four dialectical assemblages inspired by berman but it was ultimately dallas and miles rather than the broader collective represented in the podcast that used this conceptual framework to illuminate and bring into sharper focus the different concerns and questions raised by the various contributors the discussions about the podcast project that form the substance of this collaborative writing piece were much more revealing than the podcast production process these discussions quickly turned to positionality privilege power people place and voice although the contributors to the podcast were broadly diverse in terms of gender age academic position and geographical location with contributors from nine countries across the global north and south the views and experiences reflected in the podcast were largely although not exclusively coming from various positions of privilege while every participant was affected personally and professionally by the covid19 pandemic and these stories are important there were big silences too various minority groups voices and experiences were absent from the podcast the sacked servicesector workers sleeping rough on the streets of london or rohingya refugees in a bangladesh camp we only hear a glimpse of these types of stories in the podcast when we hear about informal settlements in india or the effects of covid19 in iran or the plight of aboriginal families in regional australia who and what was and was not heard thus became central questions in our postpodcast discussions so much of what we learnt about covid19 in cities was mediated by news current affairs and social media and by policies and laws the financial and other logics underwriting these media routinely privilege powerful voices and institutions as marginalised voices struggle to be heard it was hard to hear the full force of the virus social political economic impacts of covid19 in cities as a digital methodology then the question of who gets to speak through podcasting and who is listening deserves more attention future research could target the tension we have noted here in this emerging digital methodology that is the power and privilege that is afforded to academics to speak and the silences in our debates about cities indeed this type of critical reflexivity opens up a longer process of engaging with urban soundscapes along political social economic and other lines and beyond the moments of recording and listening being critically reflexive requires slowing down to listen and observe to ponder and reflect and to integrate and synthesise it might also require us to put the microphone down as a digital qualitative methodology podcast production with accompanying critical

but isnt stepped care meant for clinics with inadequate resources a head-hunter for an ivy league school expressed interest in my candidacy for director of an integrated wellness and counselling centre with a multi-billion-dollar endowment this school is not afraid to chart bold paths through innovation your approach might be just what they are looking for i was impressed my ego inflated an ivey league school might be interested in me not so though in the end while the head-hunter was intrigued she could not sway the committee we have lots of resources we dont need stepped care the committee chair reportedly said to the head-hunter i had originally assumed as much it had started as a model for an impoverished remote canadian province and our own under-resourced university counselling centre but ever since i gave that 10-minute conference presentation in chicago in 2015 i have been inundated with requests for consultation on our model from some of the unlikeliest places one of the first is known by many as canadas ivey league leader initially i had been invited to co-lead an administrative review of their mental health programming i mentioned my work on stepped care during that visit and was invited back to present the model at the time this university had about 50 clinicians for 40000 students it has since increased the number of staff dramatically somehow they still struggled with a long waitlist they had an abundance of resources the students were unhappy the staff were unhappy change was necessary while the change process was complex and not without storming and controversy the model was adapted to the unique culture of the institution and its commitment to be the best of the best
 our small consulting team cornish  associates stepped care solutions ltd has worked with over 100 colleges and universities across north america who have expressed interest in sc20 recently provincial and territorial governments in canada have contracted with us to introduce the model more broadly through the countrys publicly funded healthcare system a core feature of sc20 is its flexibility and adaptability some have remarked that it is more of a recovery care design process than a treatment model it is certainly not a manualized program in keeping with the principles of distributed co-design it looks different in every location the case study presented below describes co-design stories across all six stages of the implementation cycle these have been drawn from experiences on our own campus and work we have done with a variety of institutions in both canada and the united states many details have been changed to preserve anonymity i thought that was the end of my work with the university however about 1 year later i was invited to present on the stepped care model to all clinical and administrative staff in the three wellness departments i worked in advance with leaders of two wellness departments the only two who were intrigued to plan the agenda the leadership teams of the two departments sat at the same table as me near the front of the room i thought this was a good sign the leaders were in this together collaboration was happening there was both excitement and apprehension throughout the day of the workshop many were intrigued however a handful of very vocal critics held sway these clinicians some from each department were sceptical their questions at times bordered on hostility it was it turned out the beginning of a period of significant storming some of the clinicians filed grievances with their union others consulted with their professional organizations sc20 was considered a potential threat to their professional autonomy ethical practices and even their livelihoods the model was perceived as prescriptive  mandating low-intensity low-quality programming some of which they feared would be facilitated by other professions paraprofessionals or peer supporters i soon discovered that all was not well between two of the three leadership teams one leader expressed serious concerns about sc20 and dropped out of the consultation process with us another leader while not hostile to the sc20 model did not see it as relevant at the time her department was not slated for amalgamation like the other two the third leader continued to work with us convinced that stepped care held promise despite the internal conflict the university administration decided to go ahead with adapting the model they invited me to visit again this time to work with a smaller design team the group on this team were enthusiastic and committed this group knew why they were working on transformation and were wowed by sc20 however one of the two departments had completely disengaged the why did not seem clear to them as such collaboration between the units deteriorated the one department that decided to go it alone received some institutional support lower intensity programs were launched including e-mental health tools and a rapid access system the departmental leadership seemed pleased and i was too but the transformation process was on shaky ground our sc20 consulting team offered to help resolve some of the conflict between leaders of the two separate units that were to be merged at a future date the unit that was more engaged with us was comprised of counsellors psychologists and social workers they identified as non-medical the disengaged unit was more medically oriented the mental health counsellors worked alongside health clinic staff including physicians psychiatrists nurses and nurse practitioners i was surprised initially that the medically oriented unit was not as interested in the model stepped care was initially developed for medical settings to improve coordination and transfer of care between primary care physicians and psychiatrists but the drive for change had historically come from primary care practitioners who were frustrated with challenges accessing psychiatric care or consultation for their patients at this university psychiatrists were the majority among the staff of physicians nurses and nurse practitioners the unit was led by a psychiatrist all the staff psychiatrists worked fee-for-service which was covered by students insurance it was a private practice model of care they did not receive benefits from the university and their allegiance was to their patients rather than the institution first we met with the leaders separately to gauge their interest in mediation they agreed only if the sessions would be structured according to an agenda developed in advance with their input over the course of 5 months we met four times via web conference with the two leaders an agenda was developed collaboratively prior to the first meeting and notes were flip-charted using the screen share feature we carried forward the same agenda across all meetings adjusting as we went along common goals were identified which include developing recommendations forthe relationship between the two leadersmore consistent revenue structurescampus-wide consultations on mental health service reform and possible restructuringhow they envisioned their roles adapting through restructuringfull implementation of an adapted version of sc20 while the relationship between the two leaders had been strained we got a sense that they liked each other they recognized how their different styles were complementary one was thoughtful and cautious whereas the other was passionate and eager to act early on we also named the elephant in the roomone of them might be vulnerable was one of their positions at risk with restructuring we agreed after some discussion that it would be useful to explore the kinds of roles they envisioned with restructuring it turned out that the administration was not in a rush to complete restructuring instead they were interested in what both leaders would recommend following campus-wide consultations that had begun prior to our first contact with them the university had a reputation for consulting widely and repeatedly on many issues the focus of the consultation was vague it was intended to gather all and any input on mental health experiences and ideas after 5 months of consultation and support from our team the two leaders completed their report it recommended a flatter organizational structure with a variety of adjacent lead roles to facilitate development of the new care model yet to be designed the following lead roles were adopted healthy campus lead primary care lead mental health lead collaborative lead and stepped care lead the report also recommended that the merger would ensure that all staff would be funded by a blend of insurance and operating revenue and that all would be eligible for benefits the new money and matching central funds would allow for this in hindsight we had attempted to move too quickly to solutions we had only gotten to the first step in the distributive design cycleworking at the inner circle with leaders while we had made strides with the internal leadership team we had underestimated conflict among staff we thought we had solved some problems to their satisfaction low-intensity programming including e-mental health tools was helping to curb student demand already aligning revenue streams would bring clinical staff on board and flatter leadership roles would ensure meaningful roles or existing leaders following restructuring but the buy-in was not there the two leaders had heard a number of complaints but collectively we assumed we already had answers low-intensity programming and stepped care yes consultation had happened broad input had been obtained but not true co-design while all stakeholders agreed that demand for care had been exceeding supply there was no shared perspective on why this was the case  disregarding sineks appeal to always with why sinek 2009 we had moved directly to what and we were nowhere near a well thought out implementation method how a public relations crisis made the false start obvious although never proven rumours circulated that some disaffected staff had warned the student union that the stepped care program was a threat to good service in an effort to save money and decrease wait times service quality would be compromised some clinical staff left the university they were uncomfortable with the prospect of altering their practices in alignment with the model that was already being adopted highly critical articles were published in the student newspaper the university communications team became involved senior administration officials had no desire to reverse the course on stepped careafter all early indications were contrary to the press reports that it was working secondly funders were very interested in the model however with input from the public relations office a decision was made to rebrand the change instead of stepped care the new approach was labelled cooperative care this was a brilliant move because not only would there be a commitment to stepped care principles but in addition the issue that had derailed implementation internal and inter-department conflict could be addressed with a focus on relationship-building the crisis became an opportunity to implement a formal process of working through storming at two levels level 1 among clinicians and leadership and level 2 with persons with lived experience students and the student union leadership after the dust settled it became clear through deliberate engagement with clinicians student union representatives as well peer helpers what the problem areas were the why change became more obvious students found the current organization of programming confusing why were there two departments offering similar services which one do i go to why do i have to wait so long when we have more funding and more staff than many other colleges and universities do we really have quality programming cant we do better by pausing implementation and asking stakeholders whether andor why anything whether it be programming clinical roles or leadership structures should change motivation to participate in the design process increased when the clinicians learned that changes would address inequities in funding between the two units preserve their professional principles and values through horizontally organized process leadership roles and that the decisions on how and what to implement would involve them directly buy-in further increased likewise when the students learned that access to care would be streamlined and the new model would only add programming not remove anything they valued they were on board finally both groups were reassured that future steps would include consideration of a wide range of possible solutions and that they would be involved in the process they were invited to search for and create innovations that addressed the issues of importance to them the fact that staff and students were supported to engage in blue-sky thinking to address their own needs indicated a shift from why to wow we had completed stage 2 identifying why change and inspiring some wow among the leadership team clinical staff and the students persons with lived experience we could have stopped at stage 2 the core stakeholders were engaged why do we need to keep moving outward the university leaders had researched innovations contracted with us as thought leaders for innovative practice students and clinicians were part of the co-design process should this not be enough a wide range of expertise and experience had been tapped but as gino cautions accumulated expertise and experience can be restrictive in her npr interview she referred to a study she conducted on cardiac surgeons who had been notified by the food and drug administration that a routine technique was no longer considered safe the results indicated that the more experience a surgeon had the less likely they were to change their practices in response to the fda warning gino 2018 the clinicians managers and students at the university we had worked with thus far had considerable experience as a result of this experience we wondered if they might be too deep in the forest to recognize out-of-the-box ideas compared to outsiders would their collective years of experience with established practices make them less receptive to novel experimental ideas outsider perspectives according to gino are crucial for innovation following the two suicides at memorial university chap 101007978-3-030-48055-43 it was conversations with residence leaders not counsellors managers or students attending counselling that led us to recalibrate what needed to be changed before these conversations the suicide prevention strategy had created an atmosphere of high tension and fear the risk paradigm had not been challenged we had not even recognized its presence the protesting residence leaders alerted me to its presence and the conversations that followed inspired a vision of a more engaging vibrant residence community that could be cultivated in the very space occupied by postvention puppies the idea of bringing fun and games back to that multipurpose room was a wow moment the residence leaders who helped us to see where we were going wrong with the risk paradigm would not have been invited at a stage 2 level had the distributive design cycle method been in place at memorial university but they might be considered for participation as external stakeholders at stage 3 at memorial university group counselling programming had been poorly attended for years the student peer network at memorial could not attract interest in their activities they had helped to market the groups with us but with no success the experts and students with the most experience were stumped given the increasing demand and the full waiting rooms why was there no uptake we had no answers but when a new director of the botanical gardens approached me expressing interest in mental health we discovered an alternative he had a background working in psychiatric hospitals as a horticultural therapist he wondered if there might be opportunities for collaborating with the counselling centre he came to a staff meeting and presented on his work one of our counsellors had expertise in mindfulness the concept of green mindfulness was hatched at this meeting together they launched a 90-min weekly walk-in event in a high traffic area of campus it quickly became known as a place to get a new houseplant when students wandered in they were invited by students from the peer network to take a cutting and plant it mindfully in a small pot they were encouraged to feel the texture of soil its temperature they could take a mint leaf and absorb the aroma of fresh mint tea an average of 100 students attended each week it took an outsider the director of the botanical gardens to solve the problem of failed group work and the lack of uptake from peer mentors before his appearance we kept offering the same kind of groups somehow continuing to think people might start coming the peer mentors determined to build a successful peer counselling program continued to host drop-in hours for 2 years despite few takers none of us considered that we should stop doing this or try something different while undoubtedly success stories bringing fun back to residence and green mindfulness the prompt for change was random and could easily have been missed what would have happened if the resident assistant the director of the botanical gardens and all kinds of other outsiders had been deliberately invited to answer the question why change maybe innovation would have happened more smoothly and rapidly returning to our mid-sized public university what might the broader community think about change would extending the why change your practices question be of interest to academic advisors to the fitness centre to the student residences to faculty partners and then what about the city beyond the campus are there no other influential organizations asking questions about change could we engage in a broader conversation about change in policies with potential external partners who else wants change are others being inspired by new ideas can we share our wow blue sky ideas not surprisingly conflict also emerged when we got to stage 3external stakeholders campus staff and faculty invited to participate in the discussion were divided some said the problem was that the clinicians were not seeing students fast enough and did not have time to consult with them when they called others simply wanted the clinicians to take the mental health problems off their hands they did not want to learn more about how to support students because that was not part of their job it appeared that at least one common problem among all stakeholders clinicians managers students staff and faculty was the sense of being overloaded with no room to do anything new or more what were their needs all stakeholders needed something to make their experiences easier more manageable and more comfortable how could wow be facilitated for external partners we already learned that moving too quickly to how or what will fall flat resolving tensions cannot happen without some consensus on the question why change some tensions were traced to conflicting opinions about what constitutes best practices in mental health care about a year after implementing cooperative care the manager of counselling services received a complaint from a student union board member the board member said that students were complaining about the new model the manager called the board member to suggest they host a joint meeting with all who might have concerns several board members attended along with a representative from a student society group focused on mental health awareness programming the student society representative complained about the quality of care they received at the counselling centre what did they say about the quality did they have negative experiences asked the counselling manager no replied the student but they both see dr x at the health clinic operated by the faculty of medicine and he said to them that they should be getting weekly cbt treatment with hour-long sessions for up to three months that is best practice and their symptoms warrant this the manager thought for a few moments and then said sometimes care providers on our own teams disagree about what constitutes quality care if you are interested i can show you part of a presentation i give frequently which shows how we are both right cbt is evidence-based but so is our model would you like to see what i have been presenting to my colleagues at conferences about our cooperative care model the students agreed they asked pointed questions and seemed to leave the meeting both satisfied and intrigued the counselling servicer manager made a note to set up a meeting with the chair of family medicine as external consultations at stage 3 continued it turned out there were several philanthropic organizations interested in participating when they joined we learned of their concerns about current practices and more importantly how eager they were to fund change for years these organizations had been funding regional and national projects gathering data in support of innovation they hinted that some of their funders were now ready to donate large sums of money to support change their raison detre was to fund broad systemic innovations aimed at serving all stakeholders they were committed to well thought out strategies based on implementation science a one-day forum was hosted by one of the philanthropic groups with a focus on implementation science an expert facilitated the workshop participants learned about the drivers of successful design and implementation they were introduced to tools that would help focus the work at stages 4 5 and 6 of the multi-sectoral design cycle they agreed to engage the implementation science expert again at later stages to support their work prior to the engaging stakeholders on the why and wow process at stages 2 and 3 consultations had been reactive and unfocused previously when students or other campus stakeholders complained or worse published scathing reports in social media or the campus newspaper administrators and public relations staff were only able to work on putting out the fires by the end of stage 3 however all parties the sc20 leads clinicians managers persons with lived experience and external stakeholders agreed on the why of change and were more inspired wowed by what could be with agreement that change was needed and shared understanding of issues to be addressed all stakeholders were ready to begin identifying solutions they had been inspired enough by opportunities but there was no agreed upon process for building solutions or a clear sense of what those solutions might look like it was time for an environmental scan field trips were organized representatives of the mental health strategy committee arranged visits to three campus that were a little further along in their transformation process in their visits they asked about their process the changes what did and did not work and why following the visits a workshop was held to debrief stakeholders at all levels were asked to think about how to move forward one of the lessons learned by an institution they had visited was to resist the allure of the shiny object the manager of counselling at one campus they had visited admitted to having a reputation for saying yes to every new and exciting e-mental health program that promised to solve the challenge of increased service demands while programs were evidence-based or evidence-informed little attention had been paid to implementation strategy the utilization rates had been low the committee agreed that they did not want to fall into the shiny object trap one of the members had recently attended a conference where a psychiatrist now a canadian senator warned that the bloom will eventually fade and fall off the rose of e-mental health while this committee member was not so pessimistic she was wary of the promise of technology the hype can be overblown the committee struggled with a common implementation tension one side cried for bold action now mental health reform here is long overdue weve been working on this forever one more study will sit on the shelf gathering dust and nothing will change while perhaps less passionate but equally pointed another committee member countered shiny-object syndrome will lead us down blind alleys we should proceed carefully and cautiously in the end they agreed that balance was needed there might be some things that can be actioned immediatelyinitiatives that have already been researched and subjected to broad consultation politicians for better or worse are masters at balancing quick wins with carefully planned drawn-out strategies requiring exhaustive consultation a few carefully selected immediate actions can satisfy pent up demand and inspire others to commit to change was there anything in line with their cooperative care model that could be implemented without further delay what needed more careful consideration a representative from the universitys marketing and communications department spoke up i think what we need is a good communications strategy so that we can leverage anticipation the way apple does but of course within an academic values frame a counsellor on the committee added that managing expectations is very important in mental health treatment expectations are key to positive outcomes but she admitted that this was not part of her skillset and cautioned that our licensing board actually prohibits any type of promotion of psychological services due to the potential for manipulating vulnerable persons advertising is considered unethical another counsellor countered this caution we are masters of persuasion our practices sell hope some psychotherapy schools are explicit in this respect ericksonian hypnotherapy for example has influenced many contemporary methods including solution-focused narrative and positive psychology approaches has the ethical code proscription on promotion been interpreted too broadly other committee members were intrigued this could work on so many levels one said the transparency about our process is in keeping with recovery principles and a more proactive approach could stimulate feelings of anticipation and hope perhaps promotion aimed at the principles underlying the system of care would be considered outside the scope of the profession especially if it is guided by external partners and administrators and not the practitioners alone a ripple of excitement spread through the room the first clear action-step an example of what was emergingcommunications the committee would work out a full implementation strategy with input from the communications experts sitting on the panel a communication strategy would roll in tandem with implementation steps the committee prepared a report with recommendations organized along six guiding principles 1 access to care needed to be streamlinedthere should be a clear point of entry 2 options for care need to be expanded since one size does not fit all 3 the care system needs to be nimble and informed by continuous co-design by all stakeholders 4 the care system needs to be accountable with its mission to improve outcomes 5 implementation should follow best practices informed by implementation science 6 a communications strategy is needed to stimulate hopeful help-seeking at stage 5 the work was transferred back to internal stakeholdersclinic managers clinical staff representatives from student affairs and students with lived experience one of the first tasks was to re-engage with the implementation science consultant this was deemed essential to ensure the what would not get ahead of the how implementation science has been defined as the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice and hence to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services eccles  mittman 2006 the practice has evolved to address what is referred to as the implementation gap that exists between research and practice while evidence may exist to support care practices the practices are often not adopted if they are adopted they may not be used with fidelity to the intervention originally tested and even if they are used with fidelity to the originally tested intervention the practices may not be sustained and if they are sustained in one setting they may not be scaled up or replicated in other settings multiple gaps may interfere with impactful knowledge mobilization our six-stage sc20 distributive design cycle is an example of an active implementation framework metz  bartley 2012 in addition to organizing the process through phases that extend across 24 years an active implementation framework specifies useable interventions drivers for successful implementation processes for improvement and composition of teams an initial step in developing an implementation framework is to articulate a clear description of the program second the essential and gold standard features of a program or model are identified third core interventions are clearly operationalized in line with underlying principles finally practice guidelines and standards are developed to allow for performance and fidelity assessment typically few programs are implemented with attention to all these features of implementation science while most programs are clearly described few identify the core or essential components and most fail to operationalize or test for fidelity in practice settings our team recently compiled standards for stepped care 20 in collaboration with the mental health commission of canada mhcc in press the standards are currently being applied through the implementation of a digital platform that extends sc20 to all canadians as part of the government of canadas covid-19 mental health response wellness together canada 2020 the platform provides the technological infrastructure for not only tracking and enhancing outcomes but also treatment fidelity to the new sc20 standards as indicated in fig 71 meaningful outcomes for any new program depend on the efficacy of the intervention how it is implemented and the context in which implementation occurs in our six-stage implementation model enabling contexts are nurtured first by asking why change is needed and by inspiring blue-sky wow thinking this nurturing happens long before effective interventions are selected the what and before application of implementation science the how the implementation science consultant met several times with the team the goal was to develop useable cooperative interventions the university wanted a clear description of what cooperative care really is but first the team worked through another full-day workshop aimed at developing cooperative care practice profiles practice profiles were developed using a toolkit designed to operationalize care principles the toolkit ensured that treatment protocols were based on research and information about best practices it also ensured that competencies aligned with innovations and that the innovations would be phased in gradually it was important that the incremental process of adoption met the expectations of all stakeholders the facilitator began the day by asking what are the critical non-negotiable components of your cooperative care model to know if a component is critical ask yourself if it were to be missing would you no longer be able to think of it as cooperative care the team defined cooperative care and came up with five critical components see table 71 then for each of the five components workshop participants operationalized in turn what ideal implementation acceptable variations and unacceptable variations might look like beside each they also specified what outcomes could be expected if acceptable variations were applied with fidelity for example the first component flexible approaches was operationalized first by deciding the number of step categories and then populating them with existing programs the team decided on a 10-step model ranging from prevention at the lower end to psychiatric consultation at the higher end but because of the sensitivity to hierarchy and the long-standing discomfort with the word stepped care the category list on their graphic was unnumbered in the prevention category four programs were specified orientation events outreachdistress activities training for professors and other campus staff and departmental talks for the various faculties the second component treatment that gives students choices was operationalized in several ways one stemmed from a mock webpage storyboard created by participants to map out the envisioned help-seeker experience they drafted a counselling services webpage with the title what kind of support are you looking for four top-level options were drafted 1 mental health support 2 support for a physical health condition 3 academic support 4 i want to learn more about mental health and self-care if the student were to click on the first option mental health support three options would appear a i need to speak with someone right now b its not a crisis but i still need to talk c i am not in immediate distress or i am open to online resources then if the student were to choose option 2 its not a crisis but i still need to talk they would see four options speaking to a professional right now speaking to a professional in person speak to a peer or speak to an academic advisor by the end of the day practice profiles were completed for all five components of the cooperative care model participants were cautioned that none of these operationalized care components would succeed without careful attention to enabling factors what needed to be in place to support implementation what were the implementation drivers for their campus these were identified at the next meeting as indicated in fig 72 several drivers were specified on organizational leadership and competency dimensions on the organizational level support was needed to adapt policy fund new initiatives support the implementation process and develop technological infrastructure managers had to develop new procedures for operations and strategies for anticipating and mitigating team dysfunction that might arise through the transformation process clinical and organizational training was needed to adapt practices and develop new competencies a system of coaching or mentoring was needed to support ongoing adjustments to care at stage 6 the co-design process was complete the implementation team was in full operation useable interventions had been defined and enabling structures were in place funding from donors had been received and matched by the university architects and contractors were hired to redesign and renovate the space to facilitate smooth integrated cooperative care technological infrastructure for self-check-ins shared record-keeping therapeutic monitoring and web-page improvements was developed policies and procedures were adapted or created anew new staff with experience in walk-in single-session counselling and e-mental health care were recruited and hired none of these new staff were hired within the existing counsellor collective bargaining unit this decision was made in collaboration with the union representing counsellors vacancies within the bargaining unit would continue to be filled for the next 3 years and hiring outside of the bargaining unit could only be made with new funds this agreement helped resolve some of the anxiety expressed by existing staff about the future of their roles on the other hand it meant that some of the existing staff no longer felt obligated to adjust their practices in line with the new cooperative care model since this new way of practicing was only required by the new hires outside of the bargaining unit we reminded the managers of the units to use the same approach to change management as counsellors use with their clients in the context sc20 rather than urging staff to become more ready for change the job of managers was to connect with staff where they were already this pivot to where people are ready did not mean that any staff would be isolated from the new model training was provided to all staff on recovery principles stepped care decision-making collaborative care walk-in care interviewing techniques case management and e-mental health tool use weekly meeting agenda structures were adapted to facilitate modified operations for example case conferences shifted focus to sharing successes and failures with single session care stepping decisions therapeutic monitoring and using time more flexibly staff were supported to join community of practice webinars on stepped care attend relevant conferences and conduct research on topics related to the new model at the time of writing stage 6 implementation had just begun the renovations were complete and a more centralized collaborative care hub was in operation a flatter organizational structure was in place with six leads reporting to a new assistant dean of campus wellness the two mental health managers as well as the manager of primary care services had received promotions to campus lead roles there was still a lot of work to do before the new wellness hub would be truly integrated the physicians were still operating in isolation and there was no unified health record a new cycle of design would be needed to move to fully collaborative care francesca gino

run around practicing sly deviance and disruption lets make room for all three  lipid moieties of mycoplasma pneumoniae lipoproteins are the causative factor of vaccine-enhanced disease arlind mara b tyler gavitt d edan tulman r steven geary j steven szczepanek m   mycoplasma pneumoniae mp is a highly contagious and widespread human respiratory pathogen causing over 2 million cases of community-acquired pneumonia cap and 100000 adult hospitalizations annually in the united states1 additionally innate resistance to commonly used -lactam antibiotics increasing resistance to macrolide antibiotics and mortality in certain demographic groups establish mp as a high-risk pathogen capable of causing acutely severe disease27 critically no vaccine against mp is available as experimental vaccine-enhanced disease ved after infection has stymied further development m pneumoniae ved was first reported in human volunteers in the 1960s in these studies prisoners and military recruits were vaccinated with formalin-inactivated or a serially passaged live-attenuated strain of mp then subsequently challenged with a virulent strain of the bacterium while some protection was observed many vaccinated individuals in both studies exhibited more severe clinical symptoms than those receiving a placebo control89 recent studies by our group and others have since recapitulated ved in an animal model by utilizing live-attenuated or crude extract mp vaccine candidates respectively1013 in these murine models ved is characterized by more severe histopathology post-challenge when compared to sham vaccinated mp challenged mice ved has also been observed in vaccine candidates against other mycoplasma species making the identification of the causative factors a crucially important task for vaccine development against these atypical pathogens to identify the specific causative factors for mp ved we utilized tx-114 phase partitioning to fractionate mp proteins into three fractions a lamp hydrophobic detergent phase an aqueous phase aq harboring mostly hydrophilic cytosolic proteins and an insoluble phase ins containing the insoluble triton shell and a spontaneously forming phospholipid-rich precipitate14 an initial pilot study indicated that vaccination of balbc mice with lamps resulted in ved after challenge with virulent mp we performed proteomic analysis to reveal lipoproteins elongation factors chaperones and chaperonins and cytadherence proteins previously found to induce strong antibody responses1517 as the most abundant immunogenic and antigenic components of the lamp fraction fig 1af of these lipoproteins are the most abundant 3179 fig 1a and include twenty-two lipoproteins representing all six mp lipoprotein families fig 1b c family 2 lipoproteins paralogs of the immunodominant mycoplasma gallisepticum nucleotide-binding virulence factor msla1819 were the most abundant lamp lipoproteins making up 4322 of the lipoprotein fraction fig 1c lipoproteins not belonging to a multigene family were the second most abundant lipoproteins in the lipoprotein fraction 3283 followed by family 4 lipoproteins 1173 family 3 lipoproteins 553 then family 6 lipoproteins 436 fig 1c members of family 5 lipoproteins which are specific to mp were also identified in the fraction albeit at minute relative quantities 067 fig 1c mycoplasma lipoprotein lipid moieties are known to be potent immuno-stimulators inducing expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-6 and il-1 following the recognition of their lipid moieties by toll-like receptor complexes20 given that these cytokines are frequently associated with immunopathology we hypothesized that sensitization by mp lipoprotein lipid moieties during vaccination induces ved upon challenge with virulent mp to test our hypothesis tx-114-derived mp fractions were treated with exogenous lipoprotein lipase to generate delipidated fractions dlamps daq and dins which could be tested for immuno-stimulation in vitro and as vaccine candidates in vivo successful delipidation was assessed via a tlr2 bioassay in murine macrophages lamps stimulated higher levels of tnf- than aq and ins fractions delipidation significantly reduced lamp-stimulated tnf- production notably to levels lower than those stimulated by aq or ins fractions fig 2b surprisingly delipidation also reduced aq fraction-stimulated tnf- production suggesting that some lipoproteins may have sequestered to the aq phase during tx-114 phase partitioning delipidation did not affect the ability of the ins fraction to stimulate tnf- production in vitro fig 2b to test the effect of lipoprotein delipidation on ved native and delipidated mp fractions lamps dlamps aq daq ins and dins were used to intraperitoneally vaccinate mice according to the schedule illustrated in fig 2a with 50 g of protein from each fraction per dose shortly after vaccination mice receiving non-lipase-treated fractions began to display clinical signs consistent with mild septic shock supplementary table 1 supplementary fig 1 which we quantified as a group clinical score fig 2c while these clinical signs abated by 48-h post-vaccination they point to potential immediate safety concerns for vaccine candidates containing intact lipoproteins notably early clinical signs were absent in mice vaccinated with delipidated fractions given that in vivo data mirrored those obtained in vitro fig 2b early clinical signs may have resulted from the over-stimulation of peritoneal immune cells by the lipid moieties of native mp lipoproteins in terms of ved only mice vaccinated with lamps containing native lipoproteins exhibited histopathological lung lesions that were more severe than sham-vaccinatedchallenged animals consistent with lamp-mediated ved fig 2d f furthermore vaccination with lamps did not reduce bacterial loads suggesting that the induced inflammation is solely pathologic and consistent with ved fig 2e importantly vaccination with delipidated lamps dlamps did not exacerbate lung pathology fig 2d f demonstrating that the factors responsible for ved are the lipid moieties of mp lipoproteins compared to controls dlamp-vaccinated mice also had significantly lower bacterial loads fig 2e these data suggest that the dlamp vaccine preparation includes protective antigens that improve bacterial clearance and can reduce mp-induced lung disease when freed of the ved effects associated with mp lipoprotein lipid moieties mice vaccinated with mpla-sm adjuvanted dlamps and challenged had significantly reduced lung lesion scores when compared to sham vaccinated mp challenged mice supplementary fig 2a c but did not differ in bacterial loads recovered supplementary fig 2b this was unsurprising as lesion scores did not always correlate with bacterial loads these data further indicate that the choice of adjuvant will be critical in developing a vaccine that reduces bacterial loads while also protecting the host from unnecessary pulmonary inflammation the identification of mp lipoprotein lipid moieties as the cause of mp ved is a breakthrough for the field overcoming a major roadblock for mp vaccine development the findings presented here may be broadly applicable to other mycoplasma species for which vaccine induced disease exacerbation has been reported vaccination of calves with inactivated whole cell vaccines and partially purified membrane proteins of mycoplasma bovis resulted in increased pulmonary pathology upon virulent challenge2122 additionally vaccination of cattle with inactivated whole cell mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides sc and a subunit lipoprotein q lppq vaccine also were reported to exacerbate the effects of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia cbpp in challenged animals23 these studies did not identify the lipid moieties of lipoproteins or any other factors as the causative factors of ved in these cases given the parallels of these studies with our data however it is attractive to speculate that the lipid moieties of the lipoproteins included in these vaccine candidates may have been the maladaptive factors responsible for disease exacerbation indeed vaccination of cattle with the n terminus of lppq which includes the region where the lipid moieties attach failed to be protective and was also associated with adverse events24 it is important however to note that more studies need to be conducted to demonstrate the maladaptive effect of lipoproteins in ruminant mycoplasmosis vaccines in terms of m pneumoniae our data indicate that caution should be used when considering the inclusion of native mycoplasma lipoproteins in future vaccine formulations against this significant human pathogen furthermore the findings here may be broadly applicable to other bacterial pathogens for which ved is observed and suggest that the potential role of lipoproteins in this phenomenon should not be easily dismissed tx-114 partitioning25 of m pneumoniae proteins was performed as detailed in the supplementary methods see extended methods fractions were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in ts

michael setzen peter svider f kim pollock   numerous groups have taken the lead discussing rhinology-specific concerns related to covid-19 and have identified items of special importance for example the stanford rhinology division the british rhinologic society and the american academy of otolaryngology  head and neck surgery have emphasized issues relating to the recognition of anosmia as a symptom that cannot be ignored we are approaching these issues from a different perspective both with regards to the acute phase of the pandemic as well as being prepared for upcoming waves that may happen over the coming months and the future of rhinology this is an important topic for which to develop guidelines not just for the immediate portion of the pandemic but with an eye to the future in case there are subsequent waves as expected an established consensus backed by an organization would be helpful for this specific purpose some cases are clearly elective while others are obviously urgent there are however some cases in a grey zone that are not as obvious prior to establishing a guideline-backed consensus for which surgeries are not elective safety considerations must be addressed for sinonasal surgeries including exactly which personal protective equipment ppe is required in the or rhinologists from the stanford university group have performed a valuable service by publicizing their communications with colleagues abroad and their experiences with covid-19 there have been reports that during a transsphenoidal resection performed in china all 14 individuals in the operating room ranging from the surgeons to ancillary staff contracted covid-19 despite some of them using n95 masks and other ppe they have posited this may be due to viral particles becoming aerosolized during epithelial disruption and that these viral particles may stay in the surrounding air for 3 hours or longer similarly covid-19 cases were contracted following other endoscopic endonasal cases surgeon and staff covid-19 infections anecdotally appear to be eliminated with the use of powered air purifying respirators paprs in addition to these communications the stanford group suggests covid-19 testing for all surgical patients if possible two tests due to the prospects of a false negative especially in those groups that had previously tested positive in practice a significant number of rhinologists perform in-office procedures consequently guidance is needed on many of the same safety measures as for or cases similar to the or the chief concerns are whether the otolaryngologist and assisting staff need n95 or full papr masks and what type of gowning and other ppe are required these should be considered in light of the fact that many of these procedures are more minor than the ones performed in the or and whether that makes a difference recommendations for office visits are necessary both during the crisis and thereafter the same questions remain and guidelines would be helpful importantly if no procedures are performed knowledge about which type of mask is sufficient is important as well as whether gowning and eye protection are needed the transition from or-based cases to in-office procedures has been increasing tremendously 23 common procedures include debridement cryotherapy eg clarifix balloon sinus dilation eustachian tube dilation limited ess with or without a micro debrider turbinate reduction various methods and external nasal implants eg latera most important of all is when and how to perform nasal endoscopy the diverse array of sinonasal procedures above may represent completely different risk profiles covid-19 patients harbor the virus in the nasopharynx as a result the stanford rhinology division has recommended avoiding aerosolized sprays and instead using pledgets to mitigate this risk in the outpatient setting this also presents the question of whether all patients or just high-risk patients undergoing these procedures in the office obtain covid-19 testing furthermore do different procedures harbor different risks to the otolaryngologist and staff our hope is that a reliable and rapid test is widely available by the time of this commentarys publication but that may not be the case there have been numerous studies demonstrating that otolaryngology is amenable to telemedicine consultation gilani et al performed telemedicine consultation on patients with ear-related complaints and found that more than 80 did not even require in-person followups 4 another analysis noted patients with ear problems were also most appropriate for telemedicine 5 although these are relatively recent studies we would argue that in our current circumstances rhinologic patients are amenable to consultation on a remote basis as well additionally there are already available telemedicine platforms used in otolaryngology that demonstrate its potential benefits in evaluating patients in remote and underserved areas 6 such as quintree quintree medical llc detroit michigan usa the easiest concern to address is that history taking is obviously accommodating to telemedicine providers can take this opportunity to triage who needs nasal endoscopy but this requires guidelines to be developed on this for the future in our practices we feel that this involves several categories of patients patients with unilateral sinonasal symptoms warrant a repeat in-person visit after telemedicine for nasal endoscopy as well as patients with imaging demonstrating unilateral disease high-risk patients such as immunocompromised patients present a quandary particularly during these covid-19 times these are the individuals who you would want to stay home and that would certainly be appropriate during the initial telemedicine visit nonetheless there should be a low threshold for considering nasal endoscopy on them if they are having troublesome new onset symptoms such as severe pain fevers and other systemic symptoms patients with a known tumor history need appropriate surveillance and are not amenable to simply a telemedicine visit without nasal endoscopy however depending on the severity of the previous lesion perhaps some of these routine surveillance visits can be performed remotely with imaging replacing endoscopy for surveillance finally while many epistaxis patients can be seen remotely and instructed on conservative measures for minimizing epistaxis this is not always possible particularly in this day and age characterized by an expanding repertoire of blood-thinning medications the department of health and human services dhhs has relaxed guidelines on using certain platforms for telemedicine during the covid-19 pandemic hippa violations are relaxed as long as the visit is in good faith when telehealth is used for any treatment or diagnostic purpose 7 in addition software supporting video platforms including skype zoom google hangouts and apple facetime are allowed for use but those with social media capabilities facebook live twitch are still not allowed to be used several changes have been implemented by cms for medicare patients that make it easier to perform telehealth visits in otolaryngology importantly retroactive to march 1 2020 telehealth visits are considered the same as in-person visits and are paid at the same rate as regular in-person visits 8 this removes the prior stipulation that the patient had to be in an approved originating site dhhs will not perform audits examining for a pre-existing patient-physician relationship for codes that are considered established patient only while the covid-19 public health emergency continues in addition patients can be seen and billed via telemedicine across state lines assuming your state medical board approves there are several documentation requirements that are important to include for telehealth visits similar to requirements for a regular visit statements or variations on them as appropriate are helpful to include and optimize appropriate reimbursement the statements that we are suggesting to meet documentation requirements are detailed in table 1
 additionally physicians should be familiar with the difference between telehealth visits virtual check-ins and e-visits prior to the public health emergency virtual check-ins and e-visits were for established patients not seen within the previous 7 days and did not lead to an in-person visit within 24 hours 8 however cms now allows virtual check-ins and e-visits to be performed on new or established patients 9 patients need to provide verbal consent to qualify for these visits a medicare telehealth visit for an outpatient service is reported using cpt codes 99201-99215 as noted previously a virtual check-on may now be provided to new and established patients and are reported to medicare with hcpcs code g2012 this 510 minute service may be performed via telephone text or patient portal and is used to determine whether an office visit or procedure is required the last type of visit recognized by medicare is an e-visit which involves communication with a patient through an online patient portal the cpt codes used for e-visits which also may now be used for new and established patients are 99421 99422 and 99423 9 additional hcpscpt codes used for ed or inpatient visits can be used for telehealth but are less applicable to rhinology during the covid-19 epidemic more information can be found on the cms website depending on practice setting many patients are supported by commercial payers rather than medicaremedicaid most commercial payers are supporting these telemedicine guidelines however this is anecdotal patients and providers should check with individual insurances for individual insurance guidelines in an attempt to facilitate telehealth consultation and maximize its usefulness thought needs to be given to the role of ct as a substitute for nasal endoscopy in the positive patient the hazards of nasal endoscopy to both the otolaryngologist and the staff with whom they work have been suggested to be considerable in light of the covid-19 epidemic particularly with the possibility of future waves of this virus impacting our healthcare delivery system planning in advance for how to deal with patients now and in the future should be kept in mind aside from obvious indications for nasal endoscopy including unilateral symptoms immunocompromised patients and patients in whom malignancy is suspected failed appropriate medical treatment and complications of rhinosinusitis telehealth offers an excellent opportunity to gather an appropriate history supporting the need for imaging as an alternative to nasal endoscopy be it in the office or radiology suite to decrease nasal endoscopy procedures and minimize risk organizations such as the american rhinologic society ars should consider guidelines examining when it is appropriate to go straight to ct in select cases of possible covid-19 now and in the future for a patient who is being seen in person in an office with ct capability it may make sense under appropriate circumstances to utilize this instead of nasal endoscopy to our knowledge there has not been a direct comparison of in-office ct versus nasal endoscopy as diagnostic modalities nonetheless in these times this is another issue that may need to be addressed by any guidelines coming out in the current litigious environment that characterizes the practice of medicine the medicolegal risks of not performing nasal endoscopy need to be further determined malpractice litigation has had an impact on the practice of all aspects of otolaryngology including sinonasal disease and endoscopic skull base surgery 10 11 12 13 as the pandemic continues and as there are risks for subsequent waves this fall and winter guidelines for when imaging can be considered in lieu of nasal endoscopy can be a helpful resource on which to fall back in addition to surgical misadventure missed diagnoses have been demonstrated to play a role in pursuing litigation therefore in patients in whom we decide to perform imaging for the purposes of facilitating telehealth visits and follow ups we need to still maintain a low threshold for in-person consultation when there are findings in imaging warranting follow-up communication with patients is key in this regard as perceived inadequacies in informed consent play a large role in medicolegal litigation we need to be clear that in these cases ct imaging is a valuable tool that we are using as an alternative to nasal endoscopy to minimize in-person visits and risk in-office ct sinus will continue to play an important role as a point of service procedure in lieu of nasal endoscopy in patients with covid-19 or suspected thereof the covid-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted our entire society including healthcare providers those serving on the front lines including those working in hospital settings the emergency department and critical care units are at greatest risk otolaryngologists harbor unique risks due to the viral particles residing in the nasopharynx and nose this makes nasal endoscopy and other in-office rhinologic procedures a concern for the otolaryngologist with increased risk for infection rhinologists need to develop standardized guidelines with an eye to both the present and the future due to the troubling potential for additional waves of the pandemic and what the rhinologist needs to do as they get back to work both in the office and the or these include protocols pertinent to safety the substitution of imaging for endoscopy when appropriate and importantly understanding the role of telemedicine additionally it is important for rhinologists to be prepared with practical information about the differences between various types of telemedicine and how to bill appropriately none kp is an employee

 ein wichtiges kriterium bei der diagnostik von harnwegsinfektionen ist die quantitative keimzahlbestimmung  galt frher ein nachweis von 105 keimenml als entscheidendes kriterium fr den nachweis einer aktiven infektion so gelten mittlerweile bereits niedrigere keimzahlen ab 103 fr bestimmte klinische symptome und patientengruppen als schwellenwert fr eine klinisch signifikante bakteriurie insbesondere beim nachweis typischer uropathogene in reinkultur der nachweis von leukozyten erhrtet die diagnose eine bersicht zeigt tab 82
 bei nachweis von drei oder mehr uropathogenen keimen sollte die diagnostik wiederholt werden da hier mit hoher wahrscheinlichkeit eine kontamination vorliegt mehrere erreger in hoher keimzahl knnen jedoch bei rezidivierenden oder chronischen harnwegsinfektionen ebenso wie bei patienten mit regelmiger einmalkatheterisierung  z b bei querschnittslhmung tiologisch relevant sein die kontaminationsrate ist nicht so hoch wie bei der gewinnung von mittelstrahlurin als verdchtig gelten keimzahlen zwischen 103ml und 104ml der nachweis von 104 koloniebildenden einheiten pro milliliter gilt als infektionsnachweis bei nachweis von kontaminanten ist eine erneute einsendung sinnvoll hufig wird nur die besiedlung des systems nachgewiesen was zu hufigem erregerwechsel und mischkulturen in den mikrobiologischen befunden fhrt die interpretation sollte stets die klinik und laborvernderungen mit bercksichtigen im zweifelsfall sollte vor beginn einer antibiotikatherapie eine blasenpunktion durchgefhrt werden bei adquater entnahmetechnik sollte punktionsurin steril sein deshalb gilt jeglicher keimnachweis als relevanter erreger der im labor entsprechend differenziert wird kontaminationen durch hautflora bei nicht sachgerechter hautantiseptik sind mglich gegebenenfalls ist eine wiederholung erforderlich da erkrankungen des magen-darm-trakts mit den symptomen erbrechen und durchfall sehr unterschiedliche ursachen haben knnen ist eine abgestufte stuhldiagnostik sehr sinnvoll sie orientiert sich an folgenden kriterienmakroskopiestuhlkonsistenz fest breiig wssrigschleim- oder blutbeimengung

 neben kommerziell erhltlichen standardisierten testverfahren sind immer noch viele in-house-verfahren verbreitet die im rahmen einer diagnostischen anwendung ebenfalls validiert sein sollten in solchen situationen sollte ein enger kontakt mit dem mikrobiologischen labor bestehen um die mglichkeiten und einschrnkungen des jeweiligen testverfahrens bei der interpretation und bewertung der ergebnisse zu bercksichtigen bei der typisierung von mikroorganismen kommen fr unterschiedliche fragestellungen verschiedene methoden zum einsatz eine bersicht bieten mellmann und harmsen 2009 antikrper werden bei kontakt mit entsprechenden antigenen mit einigen tagen bis wochen verzgerung gebildet sodass sie in vielen fllen fr die akute diagnostik nicht geeignet sind aufgrund der einfachen materialgewinnung werden antikrperuntersuchungen jedoch hufig durchgefhrt und sind fr die beantwortung spezifischer fragestellungen auch sehr hilfreich grundstzlich kann beim nachweis einmalig erhhter titer oder eines mindestens vierfachen titeranstiegs von einem ersten oder erneuten kontakt mit den erregern ausgegangen werden auch die antikrperklassen sind abhngig von der jeweiligen erkrankung fr die differenzialdiagnostik von groer bedeutung in der regel werden bei akuten infektionen iga oder igm gebildet indikationen fr antikrperuntersuchungen sindtiologische klrung von infektionen insbesondere auch nach abklingen der entsprechenden klinischen symptomenachweis bzw ausschluss von folgeerkrankungen nach bakteriellen oder viralen infektionen z b bei reaktiver arthritis  guillain-barr-syndrom oder erythema nodosum

 fr die diagnostik akuter erkrankungen ist der antigennachweis gut geeignet so lassen sich zum einen erregerbestandteile nachweisen zustzlich besteht jedoch auch die mglichkeit bakterielle toxine nachzuweisen z b bei c difficile die hersteller bieten unterschiedliche testverfahren an die von klassischen antigentests elisaeia bis hin zu schnelltests reichen die teilweise als point-of-care-test poct
direkt auf station am krankenbett oder in der arztpraxis eingesetzt werden knnen und kein labortechnisches equipment erfordern die am markt verfgbaren tests weisen unterschiedliche sensitivitten und spezifitten auf was bei der auswahl bercksichtigt werden sollte in einigen fllen konkurrieren sie mit anderen diagnostischen verfahren wie der pcr oder der kulturellen anzucht fr die anfertigung eines antibiogramms ist die kultur erforderlich dies gilt auch fr epidemiologische untersuchungen und in ausbruchssituationen wenn eine vergleichende typisierung gewnscht ist antigennachweise sollten nicht zum screening sondern zur diagnostik bei verdachtsfllen mit hoher klinischer erkrankungswahrscheinlichkeit eingesetzt werden tab 88
 beim nachweis meldepflichtiger krankheitserreger nach  7 ifsg ist der leitende arzt zur meldung an das gesundheitsamt verpflichtet dies gilt auch fr nachweise die mithilfe von point-of-care-tests im rahmen der klinischen versorgung in der klinik bzw arztpraxis erfolgen praktisch relevante beispiele sind tests fr influenza oder legionellen das lipopolysaccharid lps aus der zellwand der bakterien ist bereits 24 h nach infektion nachweisbar und wird ber wochen ausgeschieden aufgrund der langfristigen ausscheidung ist der test nicht zur therapiekontrolle geeignet da das antigen bei anderen bakterien nicht vorhanden ist ergibt sich fr alle kommerziell erhltlichen tests eine hohe spezifitt von ber 999  in den meisten tests werden jedoch nur antikrper gegen l pneumophila
serogruppe 1 verwendet sodass fr infektionen mit dieser serogruppe eine hohe sensitivitt von 80  bis zu ber 97  besteht kreuzreaktionen zu anderen serogruppen kommen gelegentlich vor weisen jedoch eine niedrige sensitivitt auf ein nachweis von infektionen durch non-pneumophila-spezies ist nicht mglich tests zum nachweis von legionella-antigen im urin sind nur zur diagnostik von infektionen durch l pneumophila serogruppe 1 geeignet sie verursachen mehr als 85  der ambulant erworbenen und ber 95  der reiseassoziierten erkrankungen nosokomiale infektionen hingegen sind zur hlfte durch andere serogruppen bedingt daher sollten in diesem fall zustzliche diagnostische methoden wie kulturelle und pcr-verfahren aus respiratorischen proben veranlasst werden eine kulturelle anzucht ist auch bei epidemiologischen fragestellungen und gehuftem auftreten von erkrankungen sinnvoll der nachweis des legionella-antigens im urin ist beweisend fr eine legionellenerkrankung der test kann jedoch nicht nur bei einer legionellenpneumonie sondern auch in fllen von pontiac-fieber positiv sein da die antigenausscheidung variiert ist eine legionellose bei einem negativen testergebnis nicht ausgeschlossen bei anhaltendem klinischem verdacht sollte die untersuchung daher wiederholt werden der nachweis von legionella-antigen im urin ist nach  7 infektionsschutzgesetz meldepflichtig das c-polysaccharid von streptococcus pneumoniae

 bei der betrachtung von antibiogrammen und resistenzstatistiken ist die kenntnis und analyse intrinsischer und mglicherweise erworbener resistenzen wichtig primre resistenzen bestehen aufgrund des zellaufbaus oder der genetischen ausstattung der mikroorganismen solche primren resistenzen auf antibiotika werden in aller regel in mikrobiologischen befunden nicht aufgefhrt sie mssen dem anwender also bekannt sein so wird vancomycin bei gramnegativen bakterien nicht getestet da es die polymerisierung der mureinstrnge hemmt die ausschlielich bei grampositiven bakterien von bedeutung ist eine bersicht der wichtigsten intrinsischen resistenzen zeigt tab 812
 
erworbene resistenzen beruhen in der regel auf einem der folgenden mechanismen und werden im antibiogramm mitgeteiltvernderung von zielmoleklen z b verndertes penicillinbindeprotein pbp2a bei mrsa 
berproduktion von zielmoleklen sodass die antibiotikakonzentration am wirkort nicht ausreicht um mikroorganismen in ausreichender zahl abzutten z b bei folsureantagonisteninaktivierung durch enzyme z b betalaktamasen mit unterschiedlichem wirkspektrum u a penicillinasen cephalosporinasen extended-spectrum betalactamase esbl carbapenemasennderungen der permeabilitt der zellhlle z b imipenemresistenz von pseudomonas aeruginosa

 viele solcher sekundren resistenzen sind bekannt und plausibel erklrbar sodass beispielsweise beim auftreten einer chinolonresistenz bei e coli oder bei penicillinresistenz von s aureus keine weiteren diagnostischen schritte erforderlich sind in einigen fllen ist jedoch eine erweiterte z b genotypische untersuchung notwendig beispielsweise bei verdacht auf mrsa oder vre die sekundre resistenzlage muss bei jedem einzelnen antibiogramm bercksichtigt und sollte in regelmigen abstnden auch als resistenzstatistik vom mikrobiologischen labor zur verfgung gestellt werden diese muss dann von den verantwortlichen z b den hygienebeauftragten rzten in zusammenarbeit mit der apotheke und dem mikrobiologischen labor kritisch bewertet werden hierzu gehrt notwendigerweise der abgleich mit dem antibiotikaverbrauch in den einzelnen abteilungen sowie den in der einrichtung etablierten empirischen therapieempfehlungen treten vernderungen in einem der genannten bereiche auf mssen entsprechende anpassungen erfolgen dem personal mitgeteilt und umgesetzt werden  23 abs 4 infektionsschutzgesetz ifsg vom 20072000 zuletzt gendert am 10122015 fr die bewertung der antibiotikaresistenzen sowohl im einzelbefund als auch in der resistenzstatistik sind die in tab 813 dargestellten erworbenen resistenzen von besonderer klinischer bedeutung daneben gibt es seltene resistenzen die immer anlass fr weitere besttigungsuntersuchungen sein sollten

defects in cell-mediated immunity eg malnourished infants organ transplant recipients and patients on immunosuppressive chemotherapy since the commencement of the aids pandemic masur et al 1981 there has been an exponential increase in the incidence of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp in the western world currently pcp accounts for 60 of initial aids diagnosis and approximately 85 of aids patients will develop this form of pneumonia during the course of their illness kovacs  masur 1989  pcp is suspected on the basis of the clinical symptoms of cough night sweats and increasing dyspnoea with chest x-ray changes of diffuse interstitial shadowing and low arterial oxygen pressure pa02 in a person in a high risk group the diagnosis can only be confirmed by the microscopic detection of typical pneumocysts in alveolar tissue or bronchial secretions since the emergence of aids there have been considerable changes in the treatment of pcp in the 1950s pentamidine administered intramuscularly was the treatment of choice however the high incidence of sterile abscess formation at the site of injection and the finding that hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias are not encountered more often with intravenous administration led to a preference for slow intravenous infusions mallory et al in the 1960s the development of cotrimoxazole trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole changed treatment strategies it appeared to be as effective as pentamidine but was associated with a much lower incidence of adverse drug reactions cotrimoxazole therefore replaced pentamidine as the treatment of choice hughes et al 1978  with the rapid increase in the number of cases of pcp related to aids in the early 19808 it became apparent that there is a higher incidence of adverse drug reactions with cotrimoxazole in these patients than in the non-aids groups approaching 100 in some studies jaffe et al 1983  most investigators now feel that cotrimoxazole has no advantage over pentamidine as a first-line treatment for pcp in aids patients  recently a number of other regimens have been advocated by various centres as efficacious against p carinii table   i figs 1 and 2  these include pentamidine pentamidine isethionate administered as an aerosol oral dapsone-trimethoprim eflornithine dfmo  difluoromethylornithine trimetrexate and calcium folinate folinic add and clindamycin plus primaquine although all regimens show reasonable effectiveness a range of toxicities is often encountered the major features of each regimen are discussed briefly below treatment of pcp and is commonly used as firstline therapy either intravenousl y or orally the duration of treatment is 14 to 21 days depending on the severit y of the episod e adverse reactions are common with cotrimoxazole necessitating drug withdrawal in up to 50 of patients wharton et al 1986  the major adverse effects include nausea and vomiti ng rash  fever bon e marrow suppression in 20 to 50 of pat ients  stevens-johnson syndrome rare and hepatotoxicity some centres prefer intravenous administration rather than oral in the belief that there may be less nausea it is becoming quit e clear that a number of the toxiciti es associated with cotrimoxazole such as nausea or haematological toxicity are dose related and that mon itoring drug drugs 42 4 1991 concentrations and dose reductions may redu ce toxicity  for man y centres however monitoring drug levels is not possible and as newer regimens appear to be as effective many physicians readily change to alternative therapy besides changing drugs man y physicians are trying to decrease cotrimoxazole toxicity by either starting treatment with lower doses 960 rugday trimethop rim 4800 rugday sulfame tho xazole or decreasing treatment courses from 2 1 to 14 days some centres are able to maintain certain patients on cotrimoxazole throughout a full treatment course by treating through any hypersensitivity reactions that occur or by desensitising the patient to the drug finegold 1986  pentamidine at a dosage of 4 mgkg approximat ely 300mg adm inistered as a slow intra venous infusion is an effective treatm ent for pcp response rates are approximately80 depend ing on the severity of the episode unfortunately the effectiveness of pentamidine is limited by a high incidence of adverse reactions  up to 50 of patients in some studies wharton et al 1986  the most common drug reactions include renal dysfunction hypotension and dysglycaemia goa  campol i-richards 1987  renal impairment appears to be a dose-related effect and is more likely to occur if patients have been treated with pentamidine in the past have pre-existing renal impa irment or are given a prolonged course of treatment 631 hypotens ion often occurs as the drug is being infused and can usually be countered by slowing the infusion rate mallory et al 1987  dysglycaemias occur as a result of direct toxicity to the fj islet cells of the pancreas and may result in long term diabetes waskin et al 1988  although these toxicities are potentiall y life-threatening close monitoring of blood pressure and serum biochemistry can detect abnormalities early usually before the patient becomes symptomatic  the high incidence of toxicity associated with parenteral pentamidine has led to modification of the standard regimen 4 rugkgday intravenously for 21 days in an attempt to diminish these adverse effects one such modification has been to administer the drug as an aerosol directly to the lungs monk  benfield 1990  although initial pilot studies using this regimen showed promising results montgomery et al 1987  later comparative studies of intravenous versus nebulised pentamidine showed an unacceptably high failure rate conte et al 1990 soo hoo et al 1990  the disadvantage with using nebulised pentamidine for treatment is that even the most efficient delivery system can only carry aerosolised drug to those parts of the lung with adequate ventilation if patients are having difficulty in getting enough oxygen into their alveolar spaces then it is highly unlikely that they will be able to get adequate amounts of drug to the alveoli as well we therefore would not use this method in patients who are hypoxic or whose chest x-rays show any marked degree of interstitial shadowing one disadvantage with the nebulised route is that patients are more intolerant to the presence of high concentrations of pentamidine every day when they are acutely unwell personal observations unlike prophylactic therapy where wide margins of error can be tolerated in terms of amount of drug deposited in the alveoli with treatment courses the unknown variables of drug concentration droplet size flow rates and nebuliser types become more important despite these disadvantages nebulised pentamidine may be suitable for the treatment of patients with mild pneumonia normal resting arterial blood gases minimal changes on x-ray intolerance to sulfa-based drugs or those keen to be treated as outpatients one modified regimen that has been tried consists of concurrent intravenous and nebulised pentamidine for the first 3 days of treatment followed by alternate-day intravenous administration until the course is complete the rationale behind such an approach is that it takes 3 to 5 days of intravenous therapy before adequate lung tissue concentrations are achieved donnelly et al 1988  due to the strong protein binding properties of pentamidine therefore the use of aerosol delivery should rapidly elevate lung concentrations into the therapeutic range  once initial pulmonary loading has been achieved alternate-day intravenous administration should prevent accumulation of pentamidine conte et al 1990  and drugs 42 4 1991 hence result in less toxicity we have found that since the introduction of this new regimen there has been a significant reduction in pentamidinerelated reactions with no loss of efficacy eflornithine is a decarboxylase enzyme inhibitor which interferes with polyamine synthesis important for cell growth sjoerdsma  schechter 1984  we have shown this drug to be an effective salvage treatment in patients who faii to respond to conventional therapy smith et al 1990a  it is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 400 mgkg for 14 days an oral formulation is available but it is not well absorbed and causes diarrhoea response rates are approximately 60 when used as salvage therapy the major toxicity with eflornithine is related to bone marrow suppression occurring in up to 40 of patients other adverse reactions are phlebitis at the injection site and alopecia although an effective second-line agent in patients with a poor prognosis studies nearing completion in our unit comparing eflornithine with cotrimoxazole as a first-line agent have not shown cornparable efficacy smith et al i990b  there are 3 possible explanations for eflornithine being less effective when used as primary therapy rather than salvage therapy firstly eflornithine has no activity against possible secondary bacterial chest infections which may play a more important role in unresponsive pcp than initially thought when patients are switched to eflornithine because of apparent failure of primary therapy they are usually also treated with antibacterial and antituberculosis agents secondly the polyamine inhibition of eflornithine in tissue cultures can be bypassed by the addition of exogenous polyamines cushion et al 1985  it is possible that in very ill patients in an increased catabolic state who have exhausted polyamine supplies the effects of eflornithine are enhanced finally in animal models of trypanosomiasis there is pronounced synergism between eflornithine and other anti-protozoal agents bac-chi  mccann 1987  such may also be true for human pcp trimetrexate is a potent folic acid antagonist which is taken up by both mammalian and pneumocystis cells it produces a fatal blockage of folic acid metabolism allegra et al 1987a  calcium folinate is administered concurrently to rescue mammalian cells from this blockage as only mammalian cells possess the mechanism to actively transport calcium folinate into the cell the net result is the selective destruction of pneumocystis cells while leaving the host cells relatively undamaged this therapy is being investigated as both first-line and salvage treatment results to date are encouraging with response rates of 66 to 88 although reports of early relapses allegra et al 1987b and the practical difficulties in administration the drug must be given by medical staff on a strict 6-hour regimen will probably mean that this regimen never gains widespread acceptance as with eflornithine bone marrow toxicity is the biggest drawback although this usually responds to an increased dose of calcium folinate elevation of liver enzymes has also been reported trimetrexate is administered intravenously at a dose of 45 mgm 2day in 50ml 5 dextrose in water for 21 days and the calcium folinate 20 mgm 2 every 6 hours for 24 days although the 2 agents cannot be infused concurrently in the same intravenous line as precipitation will occur currently this regimen is used only as salvage therapy by a few centres  the combination of dapsone 100 mgday and trimethoprim 20 rugkgday has been shown to be of some benefit in the treatment of pcp with 100survival reported in one small study leoung et al 1986  however the incidence of adverse drug reactions was also high at 95 of patients treated in another comparative study dapsone-trimetho-633 prim was shown to be equal in efficacy to cotrimoxazole but with less toxicity medina et al 1990  the majority of drug reactions were minor rash nausea neutropenia and asymptomatic methaemoglobinaemia this combination therefore seems an attractive alternative to pentamidine or cotrimoxazole in the treatment of mild to moderate episodes of pcp it is only available as an oral preparation an unusual drug reaction that has been noted with the combination of dapsone-trimethoprim is haemolytic anaemia especially in patients with glucose-6-dehydrogenase enzyme deficiency rashbridge  scott 1973  this regimen is now commonly used in ambulatory or outpatient treatment of pcp clindamycin and primaquine have only recently been used in patients after studies in the rat model of pcp showed this combination to be effective initial pilot studies in patients gave response rates of 92 to 100 ruf  pohle 1989 toma et al 1989  although rashes diarrhoea nausea and mild methaemoglobinaemia were seen the regimen was generally well tolerated this combination is attractive in that many of the sulfa-based hypersensitivity reactions seen w ith other regimens do not occur and the bacterial secondary infections which commonly accompany pcp are treated as well it is expected that this regimen will gain widespread acceptance as more experience accumulates pseudomembranous colitis secondary to clostridium difficile toxin has not been a major problem corticosteroids have been advocated as being of benefit in the prevention of adult respiratory distress syndrome ards-type deterioration and a number of stud ies have shown improvement in oxygenation and resolution of clinical features bozzette 1990 gagnon et al 1990  steroids certainly have a dramatic effect in some hypoxic patients with rapid improvements in paoz clearance of infiltrates on chest x-rays and a resolution of fever their ultimate place in the management of pcp however is the subject of debate kovacs  masur 1990  the difficulty in deciding where to use steroids comes from the observations that maximum effectiveness is achieved if steroids are given before profound pulmonary inflammation occurs it is well recognised that deterioration in lung function occurs in the first 3 days after the initiation of treatment this is probably due to cytokine stimulation in response to the release of antigenic protein from disrupted p cariniicells steroids have proven effectiveness at preventing these effects when initiated concurrently with antipneumocystis therapy the role of late or rescue corticosteroid use remains unclear in clinical practice corticosteroids would be given to those patients with poor prognostic markers on admission to hospital  ie paoz of  80 kpa severe interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray and elevated lactic dehydrogenase ldh levels  700 ul  there is still debate as to the optimum dosing regimen but current recommendations suggest prednisolone 40mg 2 to 4 times a day for 5 days followed by 40mg daily for 5 days then 20 rugday until the end of treatment masur et al 1990  worries have been expressed that too long a course could result in further immunosuppression or that other concurrent infections such as herpes tuberculosis or candidial infections may be more severe and difficult to treat sattler 1991  certainly  refractory oral and oesophageal candidosis is a problem during corticosteroid therapy although pcp can be treated with a reasonable degree of success the underlying immune dysfunction that allowed the pneumonia to develop rema ins this means that reinfection or relapse is likely patients appear to be most at risk for pcp relapses 6 to 9 month after an initial attack golden et al 1989  since subsequent episodes carry a drugs 42 4 1991 higher mortality than the first attack prevention of relapses should result in better long term survival in some patients rainer et al 1987  the choice of agents suitable for pcp prophylaxis includes cotrimoxazole  dapsone  pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine pentamidine and clindamycin  primaquine cotrimoxazole given daily or 3 times a week has been shown to be effective in preventing pcp in patients without aids hughes et al 1987  and more recently in aids patients as well raviglione et al 1990 ruskin  la riviere 1991  the recommended dose is 5 mgkg trimethoprim and 25 mgkg sulfamethoxazole in 2 divided doses as tablets although probably the most effective form of prophylaxis its use is somewhat limited in a number of patients with aids due to adverse reactions the most common is skin rash nausea is another compla int that patients often find intolerable in a medication that they will need to be on for the rest of their life dapsone has been shown to be effective in the prevention of pcp at a dose of 50 to 100 rugday kemper et al 1990  with long term follow-up under 5 of patients had a relapse again adverse reactions are common the most worrying being haemolytic anaemia and methaemoglobinaemia some investigators have suggested that lower doses 50 to 100 rugweek may give adequate protection ogata-arakaki et al 1990  but this has not been our experience when dapsone is given with pyrimethamine it may also protect against cerebral toxoplasmosis clolet et al 1991  myelosuppression in patients concurrently on zidovudine azidoth ymidine therapy has been seen in some patients  particularl y if combined therapy has been given for more than a year the combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine has been reported to have some benefit in preventing pcp despite its lack of success in treat-ment it does not appear to be as effective as cotrimoxazole with a relapse rate following first-episode pcp ofabout 23 over 6 months fischl  dickinson 1986  it is usually given as i or 2 tabletsweek and it is likely that its poor efficacy is related to inadequate drug concentrations rash and nausea are common side effects the stevens-johnson syndrome which may occur in up to 4 of patients is a severe limitation to its use pentamidine has recently received considerable attention as a potentially beneficial drug for pcp prophylaxis corkery et al 1988 monk  benfield 1990 thomas et al 1990  nebulised pentamidine has been used with success by a large number of centres dealing with aids patients the rationale for its use as an aerosol is to deliver the drug specifically to the site of infection and avoid toxicity to other organs it is theoretically possible to do this with pentamidine for a number of reasons firstly it is possible to aerosolise the drug to form droplets that can reach the alveolar spaces secondly it adheres strongly to alveolar macrophages and so does not enter the systemic circulation in significant amounts and finally the long half-life of the drug together with its concentration in the lung means that long dosing intervals of between 2 and 4 weeks are possible conte  golden 1988 hirschel et al 1991 kronawitter et al 1991  adverse reactions seen with this form of administration include unpleasant taste approximately 100 cough 30 bronchoconstriction dosedependent and reversible with a bronchodilator smith et al 1988  nausea 5 and increased saliva production 30 there have been very few reports of systemic toxicity leen  mandai 1988 and on the whole this method of prophylaxis appears well tolerated  as with the use of nebulised pentamidine for the treatment of pcp prophylactic regimens have been developed ad hoc by each major centre seeing aids patients so that nebuliser equipment dosage and dosing intervals have varied widely making direct comparisons difficult doses have ranged 635 from 60 to 600mg of pentamidine dosing intervals from weekly to monthly administration there is also wide variation in the types of nebulisers used to deliver the drugas most commercially available nebulisers were designed for the administration of bronchodilators and thus target the large airways these have had to have been modified redesigned simonds et al 1989 or new models developed to give a nebuliser that produces large quantities of aerosol capable of alveolar deposition unfortunately some of the nebulisers in current use do not achieve these criteria and result in inadequte lung protection and dissatisfaction with this form of therapy although there is considerable debate about which nebuliser to choose odoherty et al 1988 smalldone et al 1988  it is unlikely that one particular brand is clinically significantly better than any other both jet and ultrasonic nebulisers throwaway or reusable are currently being advocated as the most efficient however any nebuliser is appropriate as long as it can consistently deliver enough droplets of adequate size to coat all the alveolar spaces in practice this means that the majority of droplets should be less than 5jlm in size preferably 2 to 3jlm newman 1985 stahlhofen et al 1980  droplets smaller than this may not settle in the lungs but be exhaled larger droplets will impact in the oropharynx and large airways increasing adverse effects such as cough and bronchoconstriction and decreasing efficacy the efficacy of nebulised pentamidine has been established in several large scale controlled studies among them one placebo-controlled study from canada montaner et al 1991  one from france comparing nebulised pentamidine and zidovudine with zidovudine alone girard et al 1989  and one dose-ranging study comparing a large dose of pentamidine 300mg monthly with a much smaller dose 30mg fortnightly  however doubts about its widespread applicability remain it is not known whether long term use of nebulised pentamidine will result in interstitial lung damage a study of 173 patients on long term prophylaxis at our centre showed that there is no de-terioration in peak expiratory flow rates over time smith et al 1991  however more extensive studies on lung function are needed worries have also been expressed about the failure of this form of prophylaxis to protect against the possibility of disseminated p carinii and about an increasing incidence of pneumothoraces in aids patients although a number of case reports of disseminated p carinii infection have been published northfelt 1989  no comparative studies have been reported against other forms of prophylaxis less than 60 cases have been reported in the world literature most associated with concurrent severe pulmonary infection or in patients with a past history ofpcp it is likely therefore  that disseminated p carinii infection is very rare  similarly the increase in cases of pneumothoraces martinez et al 1988  seems to be more related to the number of episodes of pcp a patient has had rather than what form of prophylaxis he or she is on pneumothoraces are probably caused by the rupture of thin-walled pneumocoeles which appear during recovery from pcp as patients live longer following their pcp harris 1990 it is likely that more of these events will be seen another major problem with this form of prophylaxis is the considerable expense of the drug the equipment required for nebulisation and of trained personnel however despite these concerns about long term adverse effects and the considerable cost of this form of prophylaxis it will always be widely used as a considerable number of patients will not be able to tolerate the adverse effects of the other currently available systemic forms of pcp prophylaxis especially as they all contain a sulfa moiety to which many hiv-positive patients are intolerant clindarnycinprimaquine has only been used as a prophylactic regimen in a very small number of patients who have responded to this combination as treatment of their pcp kay  dubois 1990  although data are sparse it appears to be well tolerated and probably effective a dosing schedule drugs 42 4 1991 of clindamycin 150mg 4 times daily and primaquine 263 mgday has been proposed kay  dubois 1990  further experience in larger numbers of patients is needed before this combination can be widely promoted with the necessity for prevention of relapses of pcp acknowledged by most doctors many investigators also feel that it is equally important to prevent first attacks -with primary prophylaxis -as opposed to prevention of subsequent episodessecondary prophylaxis primary prophylaxis has been used in patients with kaposis sarcoma where it was found that preventing pcp resulted in improved survival fischl et al 1988  as it is possible to predict which patients with hiv disease are at high risk for the development of pcp phair et al 1990  these patients should be offered prophylaxis centres for disease control 1989 this would include patients with kaposis sarcoma other non-pcp opportunistic infections adults with cd4 counts below 200mm 3 and children with a cd4 of less than 20 centres for disease control 1991 it would be unnecessary to use prophylaxis in hiv-positive patients with normal or near-normal immune status  as pcp accounts for 60 of aids diagnoses and 85 of aids patients will develop it during the course of their disease the elimination of this infection whether initial or recurrent with prophylaxis is now starting to affect morbidity and mortality figures survival figures for patients with pcp have improved considerably compared to patients with other opportunistic infections over the past few years harris 1990 lemp et al 1990  this improvement is undoubtedly due to the effects of both antiretroviral treatment with zidovudine plus the reduction in mortality from pcp with the widespread use of pcp prophylaxis considerable advances have been made over the past decade in the treatment of pcp with a resultant reduct ion in mortality to below 10today an increasing number of agents are available but all are plagued with major toxicities cotrimoxazole the standard remains the drug of first choice and is still an effective therapy if patients can tolerate it perhaps the most significant advance in this area has been the realisation that survival is improved most not by different treatment regimens but by early diagnosis and initiation of therapy with outpatient treatment becoming more common side effects are seen with all regimens but are predictable and should never be a cause of major morbidity modifications of dosing regimens to prevent drug accumulation will reduce most of these side effects as with treatment regimens there are also an increasing number of prophylactic regimens available to the clinician hlv-infected patients should be commenced on chemoprophylaxis when there is evidence of marked immunodeficiency cd4 count  200mm 3  oral candidiasis or opportunistic infections and tumours cotrimoxazole is the most effective agent but is not tolerated long term by up to 50 of patients dapsone and nebulised pentamidine are also effective but the optimum dose and dosing frequency remain in doubt patients are still prone to other opportunistic infections as their survival is extended and agents in the future with dual or triple activity against pneumocystis toxoplasmosis andor cryptosporidiasis are desired dapsone-pyrarnethamine and the naphthoquinone 566c80 are already showing early promising results in pneumocystis and toxoplasmosis

in the emergency department ed febrile patients were placed in the back rooms which were under negative pressure except for the day when a fellow resident noticed that the paper he tucked under the door whooshed back out at us i wished the glass was not embedded with wire decreasing one of the only views i had of my patient after 10 minutes of tedious dressing procedures i entered the room looking sounding and feeling like an astronaut i could not see the young man before methe hood had fogged up i extended my neck as far as i could to gain visual access to the lower left corner of the plastic window and i saw by his skin that he was african american yet no matter how i turned i could not see his eyes have you noticed any yellowing of the whites of your eyes lately his voice sounded strong so i wrote nad on his chart
 residents provide the bulk of direct patient contact within teaching hospitals thus they are a population inherently at risk of exposure to communicable disease this is not a novel issue because emergency medicine residents are exposed to the potential transmission of tuberculosis hepatitis and other infectious diseases5 6 7 8 9 however there is security in the established means of preventing transmission of these diseases during the sars epidemic especially in the early stages there was little confirmed information regarding optimal personal protective equipment thus 108 43 of 251 cases of probable sars in canada were health care workers10 which included residents as physicians contracted sars and became ill the role of patient contact for practitioners-in-training was called into question medical students were removed from clinical placements as were nursing and other student health care providers11 emergency medicine and other residents continued working 
when allison was admitted to the sars ward we were shocked we shouldnt have been as a fourth-year resident in the emergency medicine program she was specializing in critical care so naturally she would have supervised the infamous icu intubation of a sars patient and fellow physician she was quarantined on the sars ward taking her own temperature and communicating her physical examination findings by means of a bedside phone to the nurse who guarded her door she was not intubated and the in-laws she visited days before becoming symptomatic were not infected
 emergency medicine is a discipline that lends itself best to one-on-one clinical teaching as eds were quarantined and other hospitals became overwhelmed with the influx of redirected patients the time for faculty to teach around a case was severely restricted as week dragged into week the garb of goggles gowns gloves caps booties and the hated n-95 masks progressively drained faculty and senior residents of the energy required to engage medical students and residents as friends became sick and physicians found themselves quarantined from families morale plummeted stripping enthusiasm for clinical responsibilities including bedside teaching all of these factors contributed to a morale in which the teaching environment was suboptimal given the circumstances it is difficult to imagine how anyone could maintain a productive teaching environment during a sustained epidemic of more than 4 months 
on the first day of my anesthesia rotation the anesthetist sent the patient back out of the operating room to get his temperature checked it had been done the nurse assured us but not written in the chart nerves were frayed and the anesthetist next door said its from the high ambient co2put the co2 detector in your mask and youll see on the fifth day another anesthetist insisted on absolute sars precautions despite the elective nature of the case once i passed the tube through the white target i attached the tubing and put down the laryngoscopeonly to be upbraided by a voice from over my shoulder you just contaminated the ventilator and the tape too i looked down at the ring of salmon pink cupped in my tainted hand impressed that this step had become instinctive already i changed my gloves as instructed and with his eyes on my own the anesthetist leaned over the lax head of the patient to turn on the ventilator i hadnt perceived the alarm having been disrupted from the tenuous sequence of my new induction skills later i found a former priest-turned-anesthetist who had worked for many years in africa his view of life afforded him peace of mind in these times and me the ability to learn airway management
 the question is often posed as to how the system continued when it was overwhelmed to begin with because ed crowding was already a daily reality12 13 14 15 some experts suspect that the cancellation of elective cases and a decline in walk-ins led to an overall decrease in the number of patients seen in toronto eds during the sars epidemic16 if this was the case it would offset some of the crowding precipitated by the closure of other eds in the city however this was likely site-dependent because we suspect that hospitals closer to those with ed closures bore the brunt of redirected patients whereas more distant centers experienced less impact subsequently medical students and residents at the former sites enjoyed less teaching time than those at the latter hospitals 
we signed in and out every day lining up to have our temperatures taken we offered our ears to a probe like fingers to an ink pad the job changed significantly under the influence of sars and im not sure i could have stayed if sars had
 new clinical rotations were delayed in an attempt to diminish intersite contamination when residents changed locales11 in the end many rotations were abbreviated or omitted entirely in an effort to prevent the spread of disease beyond toronto out-of-city electives were either not permitted medical students or required a quarantine period residents the restricted mobility impinged on specialized clinical electives and even mandated a delay in the national residency match17
 
when sars arrived in toronto i was playing neurosurgeon and the daily shipments of head-injured patients from around the province decreased dramatically reducing my neurosurgical exposure to the acutely operable or unstable some patients would make it part way before mounting a fever en route only to be sent back to the referring hospital to await the shifting of their brains
 learning was also affected in the nonclinical setting grand rounds workshops seminars and simulations were either cancelled or greatly diminished in scope the reduction stemmed from 2 predominant factors the first was that to limit cross-contamination between hospital sites mixing of residents and faculty from a university program with 6 teaching centers was severely retarded thus for a period spanning nearly one third of the academic year the normal course of educational activities was altered 
i woke up one morning and coughed just once i didnt feel very energetic and i wondered if i should board the subway to go to work having already missed significant training because of the restrictions i didnt want to miss any more of the rotation i focused on my breathing in the quiet subway car during those months in toronto all heads would turn on a single cough when i left the subway i felt short of breath and i wondered if i would be the case that brought toronto to its knees but on stepping into the fresh air i realized i had just ascended 30 stairs and i recalled the previous late night hence my lack of energy
 the other factor impinging on nonclinical education involved new administrative roles of emergency medicine faculty at a municipal and provincial level numerous emergency medicine faculty were providing leadership and administrative support in detailing and containing the epidemic with these additional time-sensitive unanticipated roles previous faculty commitments to education were impaired 
when i started my icu rotation in august one of my patients had sars written on the board under diagnosis yeah but he doesnt have the disease any longer intoned the icu fellow yet some nurses gowned up while others did not i wanted to gown but i did not want to publicly dress up in my fear so i avoided the patient for the first week until i saw that others who cared for him remained healthy
 at an informal level there were attempts to limit resident exposure to potential sars patients the attending staff often facilitated resident learning by seeing the rule-out sars cases the resident would see a patient in the time it took the staff physician to gown in this way resident exposure to a variety of clinical cases was somewhat maintained 
when the sanctions were finally lifted i was amazed at our tolerance and endurance when i put on an n-95 mask now i smell sars but the association is merely of a time of uncertainty and even a modicum of security now that we survived it
 rarely does a month pass without the toronto media heralding the next plague even the most optimistic physician recognizes the high probability of recurrence of infectious epidemics there are lessons to be learned from the toronto experience so far the emphasis on such lessons relates to the more pressing issues of disease surveillance and containment yet the education of future physicians in the midst of an epidemic is not an issue that we can afford to dismiss the balance between the educational necessity of direct patient contact and exposure of practitioners-in-training to lethal diseases without established transmission mechanisms will have to be evaluated from the loss of formal educational sessions to the time required to treat patients in isolation to the disenchantment of altered job descriptions these factors need to be acknowledged in order to conceive of potential means of mitigation as emergency physicians we have the capacity to weather nearly any transient storm regardless of whether the storms become more frequent or protracted it would be wise to consider and address the impact of infectious epidemics on the education of future practitioners of emergency medicine before the next storm arrives  identity health kazuhiko shibuya   who the world health organization has already published their warning reports on gaming disorder and its mental addiction who 2015 and their site also says gaming disorder is defined in the 11th revision of the international classification of diseases icd-11 as a pattern of gaming behavior digital-gaming or video-gaming characterized by impaired control over gaming increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences those who can be identified as icd-11 case are not globally well known but suspicious cases are roughly estimated as adults approximately 42 million and youths approximately a million in japan data at 2017 since the beginning of the internet revolution internet communication and online activities among the youth had been frequently accused by serious concerns in mental health the first is violent behavior induced by playing violence game until recently video game has been argued by media psychologists xu 2018 they often verified violent behavior of adolescents related to experiences and the extent of game playing the causal relationships across those patterns have not been clarified enough yet some reasons endorsed by experimental designs are still difficult to interpret clearly bruner and bruner 2006 secondly there are still controversial issues on online addiction cases griffiths 2013 turel and colleagues 2012 2016 have been publishing serial reports on online addictions the number of people diagnosed with the condition of addiction for internet usage has been increasing in the era of social media especially adolescents and young adults are eager to immerse in online cyber-world activities they consume their time through browsing web watching online video participating in online games and internet communication in japan mic2 ministry of internal affairs and communications at 2018 reported the latest statistics that the total average of internet usage time of young citizens ages vary from 10 to 17 was 2 h and 49 min every day their motivations for internet usages diversified categories such as watching online movie 79 playing games 76 and communicating by sns and emails 66 multiple answers the most important is how we think about such online additions and youths sound development these are a kind of mental illnesses and conditions as a maladaptation of gaming and social withdrawals from actual society or they are over-adaptation in somewhat online communities rather than physical environment the former is to step further grounding in social living and the latter may suggest that they extraordinarily prefer to online human relationships it should be clinically observed in each case thus online gaming and social networking sites are indeed based on somewhat human relations and such online communities organized by providers often offer to share some comforts cooperative achievements and entertainments among active participants and simultaneously those services require much engagement among participants and then such mental obligations enforce each participant to keep playing online game and committing with the other online partners during longer times oberst et al 2017 here it experientially indicates that group commitments reduce anxiety of members and enhance comfort and mental bonding among members leary and baumeister 2000 baumeister et al 2005 their group life intends to maintain such conditions in in-group memberships and commitment belonged in group whether offline or not has crucially important meaning for them to date advanced data analysis on our phr personal health record and personality dispositions has been conducting in medics pol and thomas 2013 further the advancement of big data and the ai driven medical services is to rush into the daily life contexts marin et al 2016 king et al 2017 namely these services can offer to assess and promote both mental and physical health of each individual first as mentioned valuation by the ai at chap 101007978-981-15-2248-24 those services already contain some questionnaires on psychological assessments related to personality characteristics health attitudes and social adaptation in daily life those assessed data might intend to statistically reveal our strength of mental health and degree of adaptation in social relations and then automatic prediction for those who answered personality tests enables to trustfully measure financial limitations for loans and transactions in actual contexts therefore our mental conditions and its social adaptations to date have been unveiled by such ways and those applied services could be built for somewhat vigilance system on mutual trust among citizens mental disorder and maladaptation of each individual have possibilities to further pervade unsound influences among the others and vice versa financial bad-debt by personality dysfunctions of individual will also engender chain bankruptcy among stakeholders but those services would intend to predict such consequences in advance through checking personality maladaptation in daily life hence our digital life has been already founded in those mechanisms and the ai and big-data operations indeed interlude into our mentality secondly wearable devices and sensing tools for human behavior can help monitoring and analyzing latent patterns of physical and mental conditions in daily life morahan-martin and schumacher 2003 clifton 2016 zhu et al 2019 and telephone communication patterns using smart phone can be interacted by identifiable chronotype of each user in daily activities aledavood et al 2018 medical cares in each country has the demands to organize national health information systems and it includes big data in the relations to national assurances for health cares medical quality demographic statistics financial investment quality of life qol quantifications for modeling shibuya 2006 and other social welfares brady et al 2012 those information systems may be governing own centered database but it will be replaced by distributed blockchain database in the future during the previous era there were some troubles yet to bridge between clinical psychology and sociological studies as well as computational models and experimental cases sympathy interpretations for clients latent mental process and their needs should be taken carefully but case studies often mean that there are no effective ways to explore future patterns and expectations based on past clinical cases in the daily interactions leary 1983 kircher and leube 2003 traditionally the clinical psychological way is usually beneficial to manage mental dynamics that are impossible to be generalized and formalized clinical psychology and its fundamental assumptions usually hesitate to do generalizations from clinical case studies that is because each personal condition and mental distress may be too individualized and rather researchers in this field recommend qualitative and intensive caring ways for understanding each personal experiences embedded in actual conditions historically emerging diseases have been suffering us ever since our civilization roeser et al 2012 human history could be said as somehow survival process from lethal diseases for example there were smallpox pest dysentery tuberculosis and other diseases otherwise recent outbreaks of emerging diseases such as hiv ebola sars severe acute respiratory syndrome shibuya 2006 zika and others are still ongoing matters and those medical ways such as drugs and examination tools have not completed enough yet in contrary smallpox can be exemplified as a success case the humankind had finally achieved the extinction of this disease threat in natural conditions using vaccine as a land-breaking medical way parts of above diseases could be cured by specific medicines but known well there is another problem on resistant bacteria against those medicines to date in those fields immunological and medical investigations have been accelerated by biotechnological and gene-technological advancements those who obtained the nobel prize in physiology or medicine and nobel prize in chemistry contributed toward enhancing medical progress for well-being of the humankind in fact there were contributions by japanese scientists in the medical field eg tonegawa s yamanaka s ohmura s ohsumi y etc but the humankind cannot completely repel both disease and death according to the who report top 10 causes of death globally 20163 infectious diseases such as lower respiratory infections over 2 million deaths diarrheal diseases nearly 2 million deaths and tuberculosis nearly 2 million deaths still remain within list of top 10 otherwise the worst three cases were ischemic heart disease nearly 10 million deaths stroke nearly 6 million deaths and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease approximately 3 million deaths additionally total deaths caused by alzheimer disease and other dementias can be estimated to approximately 2 million per year globally in those areas as mentioned before computational searches by the ai driven system and big-data analysis will boost enhancing diagnosis of subtle symptoms image processing on medical data pharmacologic utility discovery and statistical precisions for future risks of each patient precision of diagnosis by the ais pattern recognition systems on medical images has outperformed more accurately than human doctors zhang et al 2019 as larger growing size of knowledgebase on medical science increasingly requires much experience for them and it will be impossible to operate any clinical cases unless the ais supports can be provided and other computational contributions to epidemics can enumerate such as computer simulations of mathematical models on spreading infectious diseases eg sir susceptible-infected-recovered small-world networking model moore and newman 2000 newman 2002 gene analysis of virus in bioinformatics ksiazek et al 2003 and risk management on health data of patients and medical policies for future controls of emerging diseases shibuya 2006 in terms of medical cares epidemiological actions should lay weights on governmental policy because there are great needs to control against secondary contagions and predict precisely dynamic trends on diseases traditionally those fields must be accumulated from onsite clinical data on diagnosis of patients and analyze statistical trends which localized in each region regarding these concerns to date online query results mostly reflect citizens intentions and latent needs for specific actual events in society recently ginsberg and his colleagues 2009 had unveiled such facts by their big data and their findings by statistical analyzations on logistic positive correlations between actual trends of data from cdc4 centers for disease control and prevention usa and web-query data among citizens had become a pioneer for big-data age namely this study clearly suggested that citizens were usually apt to seek more accurate and necessary information in uncertainty conditions such as disaster see chap 101007978-981-15-2248-210 unwelcome infectious disease terrorism and other fascinated events their study seemed to be a first breakthrough for researches using web data analysis as an implication of this finding many researchers realized significant meanings on synchronizing and corresponding evidence between web trends and offline events namely big data can be analyzed by computational engineering methodologies such as artificial intelligence statistical machine learning techniques and natural languages processing and it can open the gate to investigate novel findings automatically let me exemplify an actual case according to data from the who56 from the spring of 2009 to 2010 global pandemic caused by new type of influenza h1n1 had suffered global citizens the total amount of the death was estimated as 14286 in globally the present data at 2010 at the peak of this pandemic the author investigated those trends using google insights for search services japanese patients were roughly estimated as totally 156 million it finally includes at least 203 death cases nevertheless many citizens have traditional customs encouraged to treat and keep their hygiene in daily living below fig 111 indicates a trend of google query result inputted into keyword influenza in japanese at 2009 it was certainly that there were mostly three peaks during this year and fig 112 in contrary shows only seasonal trends of ordinary influenza except for data of pandemic patients and both peaks earlier weeks of this year and the late of year can be identified during 2009 year seasonal trends on influenza can be also recognized in each year and only bizarre peak around the middle of this year can be specified namely because the pandemic caused by new type of influenza virus occurred around the beginning of may 2009 it can understand that the middle peak in fig 111 was underlying in above pandemic influences and then in this japan case google trends could entirely indicate correlational patterns between information needs among citizens and actual influenza trends and each peak corresponded with seasonal or pandemic ones as an alternative of google query using twitter as one of microblogging tools signorini et al 2011 revealed synchronizing phenomena on online tweets about influenza corresponded with actual trends of influenza given from cdc data and they could find efficient results those metrics have stronger merits being qualified for online and real-time analyzation than trend data obtained from google query similarity broniatowski et al 2013 reported significant correlation between normalized prevalence data on influenza filtered from twitters real-time tweets data and cdc actual trends of influenza they further attempted to forecast influenza trends using data from twitter paul et al 2014 and then social media consequently enables to do real-time sensing among citizens as succeeding previous chap 101007978-981-15-2248-210 in the digitized society disaster environment and climate data have also become a target for big-data analyzation larger natural disasters and human-made hazards have globally potentials to corner to the crisis of humanity because our global society has been endlessly threatened by various disasters unisdr 2018 more than 160 million citizens have been globally harming by natural disasters every year and this data contains more than 100000 deaths per year natural disasters are almost interrelated to numerous factors such as climate demography environment and anthropogenic events further it seemed obvious that complicated factors related to climate changes in global level have been influencing those meteorological disasters eg hurricanes drought flood etc of course the anthropogenic factors eg industrial damages to the environment carbon gas emissions should be occupied in system models in order to examine detail mechanisms meadows et al 2004 especially at 2015 after serial tragedies of the tohoku quakes and fukushima nuclear disasters the unisdr as a part of the united nations at 2019 unisdr was renamed to undrr7 the un office for disaster risk reduction held the global conference on disaster management at both tokyo and sendai city of japan as consequences of much discussion the committee finally proposed following the four priorities for global actions which entitled sendai framework for disaster reduction8 priority 1 understanding disaster riskpriority 2 strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster riskpriority 3 investing in disaster risk reduction for resiliencepriority 4 enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to build back better in recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction disaster management means just our preparedness against disasters certainly the digitized global world can offer artificial space satellites wireless internet mobile computing social networking services and other mechanical relief robots and the ai driven systems and big-data analyzations on the disaster can be useful for us recently noaa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration usa has released their online services which is named as the coastal inundation dashboard9 it visually enables people to know and prepare for floods in this way nevertheless digitized systems for global monitoring the earth collaboration with each nation and analyzation of vast necessary data had been pervasively equipped but our acquired technologies for forecasting and preventing disasters have not been achieved enough yet as above four priorities said the undrr as a part of the united nations lays heavier weights on rather mitigations and resilience from disasters because of such inevitable reasons why our survival efforts from the tremendous disasters are never diminishing there are still greater needs to consider the human existential issues in disaster management here as introduced a bit at chap 101007978-981-15-2248-210 the author had a chance to conduct own researches on the tohoku quake and nuclear disasters in fukushima and this time a part of findings and evidences can be exhibited in health topic shibuya 2012 2015 2017 2018 2021 in press after 2011 the fukushima case10 of nuclear power plant accident had incubated another problem oecdnea ines international nuclear event scale ranked level 7 the worst this fukushima case can be called as a nuclear power plants crisis nrc 2011 roeser et al 2012 oecdnea 2016 shibuya 2017  at the time many of fukushima citizens lost not only hometown but background of their identities in this point they forced to be laid in identity crisis according to theoretical sociologists berger et al 1973 and giddens 1991 they commonly argued that western post-modernizations could reconstruct mindsets on reality and social identification ways among citizens during achieving industrial progresses if above severe incidents of nuclear power plants and those systems failures could be regarded as malfunctions as a symbol of modernity above consequences of nuclear crisis on the fukushima case and other human-made disasters might be contextualized to reexamine social adaptation and consciousness among fukushima citizens by sociological verifications how did daily belief systems among fukushima nave citizens against the safety surrounding in nuclear power plants deal with their attitudes had been rather steadily stabilizing among many of them before the crisis however risk cognition social constructive senses of reality and meaningful understanding against nuclear disasters among citizens would be collapsed in those conditions they were betrayed by advanced technologies government and optimistic beliefs shared among them it is probably that their theoretical discussions have few suggestions for any policies on fukushima case more than awkward theoretical bases and rather there are quite needs to tackle grounding in actuality resilience of identification purifying environment and rebuilding community for the fukushima citizens science council of japan scj 2011 shibuya 2021 in press actually this fukushima case was a reluctantly controversial issue on an accident of nuclear power plant by academic researchers in japan since the tohoku quake many natural scientists in japan were very criticized by ordinary citizens especially these were academic scholars such as nuclear physicists government-side natural science researchers and engineers at nuclear power plant and of course politicians must be also confronted with such serious criticisms funabashi and kitazawa 2012 with deep reflections the science council of japan scj 2011 published globally their investigated documents by belonging scientists and researchers in various academic fields this report laid stress on the fact description of the fukushima nuclear power plant accidents and the statement of actual conditions for researchers in foreign countries here the author conducted to investigate this scjs statement 2011 in depth using text mining table 111 shows a result by text mining analyzation on the whole contents of scjs statement and it depicted a part of frequent and important words it extracted around top 10 words among the most frequent words and its total counts within above scjs statement text at a glance it appeared that their motivations were implicated by some words such as nuclear radioactive cooling accident safety emergency evacuation and so on tepco means an abbreviated name of administrative company for electric power plants in fukushima figure 113 shows an example of network structure of words co-occurrence in this case it configured mathematically to color each separated subgraph structure that limited to important co-occurrence words the author found some clusters of words on radioactive materials fukushima nuclear plant accident inside-out and others these patterns were weighted and frequently articulated by document writers otherwise fig 114 depicts a result of three-dimensional visualization which analyzed by mds multi-dimensional scaling this time was configured by kruskal and jaccard models this method located statistically each word in cubic dimensions and it appeared some clusters such as power plants eg power plant nuclear and fukushima quake eg tsunami earthquake situation and operation and others as result of these malfunctions confidence for ruling party critically had been fallen down what text mining analysis made clear was that this report concluded the negative consensus against the nuclear hazard among scientific community in japan and their statements explicitly described that mythical beliefs among stakeholders were no avail in the case of fukushima nuclear power plant accident obviously they intended to publish the truths for globally foreign academicians and citizens in terms of mainly nuclear physics and energy engineering after the fukushima crisis as mentioned at 101007978-981-15-2248-210 without doubts many of global citizens were eager to know more accurate and immediate information in detail at that time of moment those results by text mining could exhibit japanese governance of risk management against nuclear power plants and energy policies before the fukushima case there were no rational reasons for excuses that risk communication and consensual discussion had not been openly organized among stakeholders in fukushima as it was differently the canadas case johnson 2008 rather tepco and governmental ministry had oppressed to scientifically contemplate and examine nuclear risks and their published data by ordinary citizens and external professionals with these backgrounds the focal point of disputes on the compensations has been accused by plaintiff ie citizens evacuees and victims under trials in courts oecdnea 2016 for the digitized society this fukushima case indicated further unneglectable facts iot and xaas will be deployed anywhere geng 2017 many of those systems such as computational controls and sensing networking related to power plants and sensitive artifacts will be impossible to keep under controls unless electric power can be continually provided nuclear power plants and its control systems per se always also require independent electric power for controlling those mechanisms serial incidents of the fukushima nuclear power plants can be determined by the serious factors on both the loss of external electric power supply and vent malfunctions for refrigerating systems caused by tremendous tsunami attacks besides until now the ai-driven robots sensing inner-damaged power plants cannot be activated over the physical limitations because inner-damaged power plants still remain with higher radiation dose ie the human dies immediately and computational mechanisms will be disabled by radiations sooner then the lessons for the digitized future must be intensively deduced and learned by convincible investigations in the usa after this disaster a taskforce team was immediately assembled for investigations to report the cause of the nuclear power plants reconstruction of the nuclear power plants for safety and future policy on energy management in the usa nrc 2011 their 12 recommendations within this report should be carefully read for future engineers after that it should turn eyes to persevering purification from the radiation damage caused by the nuclear accidents its environmental restoration health monitoring and socioeconomic reconstruction in community nrc 2011 iaea 2011 consequently the fukushima case definitely needs to solve nuclear accidents and future design for long-term reconstruction on their devastated communities and hometown at least the following points should be tackleddecommissioning work for the wrecked nuclear power plants in fukushimaremoval of nuclear fuel and substanceschemical management on nuclear substancespurifications in polluted placestemporary storage and final disposal of contaminated soil water and garbagemedical health survey and care for victimsrisk assessment against environment and people exposed by nuclear substancescity and socioeconomic reconstructions as consequences of serial incidents of the nuclear power plants in fukushima nuclear pollution provoked the severe disputes on human rights health radiation contaminations to foods and environmental restorations both environments soil waters and air as well as ordinary peoples who lived in fukushima were polluted and exposed by both nuclear substance and radiation gibney 2015 merz et al 2015 oecdnea 2016 sampling data accumulated by agricultural scientists endorsed that many of crops absorbed radioactive substances such as 90sr 134cs 137cs and others takahashi 2016 and excessive intake and exposure of radioactive pollutants will endanger citizens and workers health hiraoka et al 2015 consequentially enacted provisions often reflect social actualities for conquests against those hardships of citizens and evacuees the basic act on reconstruction in response to the great east japan earthquake 24th june 2011 enacted the basic policies for reconstructions for example a part of provisions clearly stipulated as followsarticle 2 the reconstruction in response to great east japan earthquake will be implemented based on the followingthe unprecedented disaster resulted in enormous damage where countless lives were lost numerous people were deprived of their basic living infrastructures and have been forced to evacuate in and out of the disaster-affected regions also the disasters influence extends over the entire nation the economic stagnation in the disaster-afflicted areas is affecting business activities and peoples lives nationwidehereafter omitted at the 2014fy the total budget of fukushima prefecture for reconstruction after the disaster was approximately 17145 billion yen including both quakes and nuclear disaster countermeasure portion of 8705 billion yen and it includes population declining and aging countermeasures as well as restoration of birth number 1423 billion yen in addition other items were 2455 billion yen for environmental restorations 1443 billion yen for living reconstruction assistance 36 billion yen for expenses to protect medical health of the citizens 316 billion yen for expenses for children and youths who will be responsible for the future and other expenses further in addition to above costs the fukushima case requires unprovoked compensations and its litigation disputes are ongoing matters in courts shibuya 2017 namely there are still requirements to solve future designing for reconstruction from devastation in their hometown next the total amount of casualties in japan was more than 20000 at the time of 2012 moreover as aftermath of the fukushima disaster one of the hardest matters was collective immigration of evacuees from their hometowns to other places in japan akabayashi and hayashi 2012 library of congress 2013  at the peak may 2012 gross migrants from fukushima eg total population of evacuees were estimated over 160000 and including this gross migrants eg total evacuees in japan were estimated over 340000 at the time of 2012 this estimation was not too low please recall similar past cases for example the case of chernobyl in 1986 reported that total population of evacuees was approximately 116000 around 30 km ines level 7 and in 1979 the case of the three mile island accident was estimated over 240000 around 24 km ines level 5 table 112 shows a part of outflow data on migrants across major cities it includes mobility data within same city it queried into big data of mic eg demographic data of migration and population and the geospatial information authority of japan eg geospatial data and distance information the numbers of citizens lived in fukushima prefecture has been notably decreasing from 21 million 2011 to 19 million 2015 and this area is statistically 13780 km2 the third widest area in japan and it compares fukushima with people lived in major metropolis such as tokyo area total population is approximately 13 million people and within 9 million people in 23 special districts nagoya area approximately 22 million people within central city and osaka area approximately 26 million people within central city in japan it namely denotes moving flows within fukushima cities moving toward one of metropolises from fukushima and moving patterns between metropolises actually there is still another problem in residential data in year 2015 a national census every 5 years was carried out in japan and it has achieved to unveil many data discrepancies and inconsistencies of population in each local area of fukushima comparing with statistics on resident data holding municipal government office and actual population from census the latter cases were almost too lower than estimated populations in many cases of fukushima to date these missing populations have not been traced properly and many evacuees did not intentionally apply immigration cards to municipal government office it means that many of them still have strong intentions to go back to fukushima in the near future however the stumbling blocks still remain against their returns even though the government purifies radioactive substances and pollutions around their towns according to the general surveys by tokyo capital government for evacuees and interviews for evacuees by the author shibuya 2017 they found that evacuees motivations which choose the destination and refuge were relying on following critical factors 1 to tie with any kindred relationships a factor of human relationship 2 rich opportunities for jobs in the new address a factor of new job opportunity 3 conveniences to manage their own real estates farms livestock and factories in their hometown a factor of holding estates first factor implies mutual cooperation and helping among local acquaintances and second answer clearly reflects their needs for jobs in new dwelling and third factor relates to geospatial location and parts of them have been living in two places of both fukushima and refuges namely their conditions were back and forth between hometown and refuge thus they could not leave to far refuges and geographical area around 300 km within fukushima and refuges satisfied their above motivations using transportations such as the bullet train highways and other land transportations it drives toward the destination within 2 h for those who required living needs tokyo and nearby area of tokyo could properly offer new job opportunities and dwelling availabilities for them our identifications are often determined by not only own cognitive factors but human relational and spatiotemporal factors and their daily conditions of mental health would be interlinked with those internal and external surroundings the fukushima case similarly indicated those mental malfunctions of evacuees caused by the human-made disaster when such individuals lose all or a part of the linkages with both human relationships and living place their mental foundation for identification will be seriously damaged in severe situations such accidents and events caused by both natural and human-made disasters will be easy to engender secondary damages against social adaptation and subjective well-being of each individual it is too important to care for each but there are resilient needs to wholly repair and revive the community among them and their human relationships such as social capital putnum 2000 kawachi and berkman 2003 kawachi et al 2008 oecdnea 2016 and family bondages even though digitized communication styles renewed our daily commitment for online community physical-contact based commitments in onsite community have still special meanings for their well-being frey and osborne 2013 reported how will contemporary industries and jobs be changed and replaced by computerization and the ai-driven robotics and they simulated socioeconomic trend patterns of jobs fitted by gaussian stochastic model their estimations have indeed shown that the ai society will engender emerging job market and require other skills for citizens but it will be clearly understood whether correct or not in the future but will a meaning on working life be steeply altered by such innovation some theorists said that both living and working are indispensable relations each other as one of the renown episodes psychoanalyst freud answered that it requires lieben und arbeiten for becoming sound and independent adult the former lieben means the accepting and loving for the others as a partner and the latter arbeiten devotes to achieving the goals for maintaining daily living by own works and pursuing enhancement of own intellectual abilities and skills both are still certainly the fundamental necessary factors for people and a life-course approach in developmental psychology has much

 the digital transforming society will enlarge our working from actual physical space to virtual online space through tele-existence and online collaboration tools and our working skills and abilities will be required conquering the harder roads of uphill progress of the ai and data sciences boyd and holton 2018 further traditional stressful working environments can be attempted to quantify and coordinate with each parameter of employees such as personality characteristics demanded skill levels abilities chemistry among members and other necessary factors now such hr human resource technology ie a case using business microscope12 enhances our working styles and improves productivities in various situations khartri and samuel 2019 analytics teams have vividly rushed to dive into the ocean of big data but matching between the needs and their analyzed solutions can be improved by further efforts active workers are usually facing issues at the marriage and family in their life courses in some developed countries the reasons due to which unmarried rate during the lifespan of the youth generation has been increasing may be understandable in worklife balance context in japan statistical data of ipss national institute of population and social security research japan13 show such facts mens case of unmarried rate excessed 20 and womens case was 106 at 2010 many adolescents frequently hesitate to lose their free time and conformity and it simultaneously means that they hate any interruptions by others and physical contacts as necessary they can choose tentative friends online su and hu 2019 using smartphone many matching service applications for marriage among future partners have been launched in japan and then the matching needs can be bridged with the youths for their marriages those matching services might be applied by stable matching problem in economics of mechanism design roth 1982 such algorithm can be formalized for matching pairs of stable marriage otherwise daily living enriches its big data ganchev et al 2019  especially there are strong requirements for children and elder people in their local community and living environment first smart sensing and ubiquitous technologies aim to enhancing our daily life shibuya 2004 and smart cities and smart house have cutting-edges for improving health services for us lee 2012 for example the digital human research center in japan proposed an autonomous caring system and simulators14 for toddlers and little infants due to their sudden and unpredictable manner of behaviors serious accidents such as injuries and death at home often happen this system intends to monitor and analyze daily patterns for improving their safety of course those systems which are equipped in smart houses are also applicable for elder people to watch their daily cares and health monitoring on the other hands secondly airbnb and similar sharing house services have been launched in many nations and big data on those paring patterns between house-owners and visitors will be arranged to analyze such trip purposes sharing durations other preferences by the ai-driven services koh et al 2019 in these regards digitization has already reshaped our quality of living in those contexts using smartphone mental health monitoring can be possible recently ben-zeev et al 2015 bakker et al 2016 especially using social media data there were innumerable examinations to analyze the relations with mental health and diagnosis of discourses on twitter and sns services for example there were enumerable cases on depression trends in community corresponding with data of geospatial location yang and mu 2015 depression detection on twitter guntuku et al 2017 adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis using discourses on twitter coppersmith et al 2015 and other borderline cases in clinical psychology eg hopeless loneliness social withdrawal as social networking services clearly indicate a part of human relationships online lazakidou 2012 it can consider that their relations itself still have sharing illness personalities and depressed mental health namely there is a possibility that latent patients were apt to be participating in such social media and some of them flocked online each other inclusive cares within communal and relationship level can be also very effective for each person traditionally in the studies of communication and communal health the concept on illness identity in interactive communication has potentials to recognize identification process for caring illness and health hecht et al 2004 illness identity could be regarded as interactive processes from personal to communal layers in terms of the communication theory of identity these mechanisms should be inclusively cared by various viewpoints from personal to social communal level that is because for example social anxiety depression and other mental and physical illness could not be easily emancipated from not only individuals but also more diverse interactions and social groups according to wegner et al they discussed mental control and relationships with the others and their findings can be understood only by including perspectives of social contexts that is it should pay attention to not only individual experiences of depression and mental distress but social relationship and interaction process with standpoints from the others aneshensel et al 2012 as implied earlier rapport interaction between clinical psychologists and clients has been better focused in empathy oriented understanding as client-centered therapy rogers 1995 clinical psychological cases such as autism psychopathy and other diagnoses usually display specific patterns of behaviors and assertions especially those who have specific disabilities against soundly interactions with the others are managed by tom theory of mind and this study intends to reveal our mental manners to recognize and coordinate with the others in dyad models semeijn 2019 freitas et al 2019 such client cannot understand any intentions asserted by the others and they often confuse meanings pretending and deceptions by the others namely understanding for the others flexibly requires more imaginable coordination in social context and the loss of such basic intellectual skills becomes difficult for them to behave appropriately against troublesomeness with the others in other words some evolutionary psychologists and neuroscientists told that the humankind could be evolved both to lie against the others and detect deceptive intentions they further said that acquisitions for those neural mechanisms of social intelligence took advantages of beating against other wild animals during surviving history of ancient peoples according to attachment theory by developmental psychologist bowlby it authorized that physical attachment between mother and children offers strong and comfort foundation during child development bretherton 1992 suggestively serial experiments also shown that an alternative of mother could be sufficiently replaced for children for example a fluffy doll as alternative of mothership could fulfill having comfort emotions for child in their experiments they tried to use a child of monkey in this concern personal intelligent robots have potentials to assist our daily life coeckelbergh 2010 as an example case paro already achieved improving many patients of mental illness and alzheimer diseases it calls assisted by ai and adorable doll-like robots such new services can be adapted in the social welfare institutes daily cares in home and hospitals wada et al 2007 yu et al 2015 their attachments with physically autonomous entities may offer them some reliefs and comforts in such ways as mentioned earlier there are certainty to automatically diagnose clients by the ai using telecommunications and smartphone sensing data accumulated by wearable devices in daily life has strong potential to detect mental illness and bad mental-physical conditions in earlier stages  vanadium risks and possible benefits in the light of a comprehensive overview of its pharmacotoxicological mechanisms and multi-applications with a summary of further research trends agnieszka scibior lukasz pietrzyk zbigniew plewa andrzej skiba   with its unique features vanadium v receives a great deal of attention from chemists biologists biochemists toxicologists and pharmacologists the biological activity of this element has prompted investigations of many organic v complexes and its inorganic compounds in terms of their potential use in the treatment of certain diseases in humans studies carried out so far on v have shown that the bioactive complexescompounds of this metal can be therapeutically active at low concentrations 12 taking into account the clear interest in the anti-viral anti-bacterial anti-parasitic anti-fungal anti-cancer anti-diabetic anti-hypercholesterolemic cardioprotective and neuroprotective activity of v and in the possibility of using this element in the treatment of obesity the present review focuses on mechanisms underlying the pharmacological potential of this metal and obstacles to use it as a metallopharmaceutical in the future key information about the mechanisms of the toxicity essentiality physiological role and metabolism of v is collected as well along with selected aspects illustrated on the timeline the review paper also summarizes the available literature data on the use of v in the tissue engineering and industrial sectors with a brief description of the risk for human health in addition our report draws attention to the directions of further research on v and to interactions of this metal with other elements especially those with antioxidant potential comprehensive research on the interactions of v with antioxidant elements summarized graphically in a separate chapter of the present report is particularly important in view of minimization of the adverse effects of v resulting from its strong toxicologicalpro-oxidative potential vanadium v is a part of the 4th period group 5 vb of the periodic table of elements it is a transition element with atomic number 23 and relative atomic weight of 5094 capable of forming various compounds and functioning as an anion or a cation 3 it exists in 2 3 4 and 5 oxidation states most commonly in the tetravalent and pentavalent form 2 fig 1
 in body fluids and extracellularly v predominates in the pentavalent form usually as a vanadate anion vo3
 conversely intracellularly it exists mainly in the tetravalent form as a vanadyl cation vo2 fig 1 associated inter alia with proteins 4 it is estimated that about 1 of intracellular vo2 occurs in an unbound form 5 it is known that the form in which v exists in the cell depends on the ratio of the total pool of reducers to cellular oxidizers 4 as presented in fig 2
 vanadium was first discovered at the beginning of the 19th century in 1801 by spanish mineralogist andrs manuel del ro who named it erythronium from the red color of the compound however the discovery was not attributed to him due to a mistake made in 1805 by one of the members of the commission of the french national institute in paris ie chemist collet-descostills the discovery was not accepted this was followed by a rediscovery of the element in 1830 by swedish physician and chemist nils gabriel sefstrm who named it vanadium 6 in polish chemical literature radwaski described this element for the first time in 1839 giving it a polish name wanad which is still used 7 vanadium is ubiquitously detected in the environment - in soil water and air 8 it plays an important biological role 4 and has a very wide area of applications which are graphically summarized in fig 3
and described in the further subsections of the present report as illustrated in fig 3 vanadium v is commonly used in many industries especially in glass paint ceramic photographic chemical electrochemical and refining industries it is also used in metallurgical industry for production of steel and non-ferrous alloys 1910 vanadium-containing steel with high hardness strength elasticity and abrasion resistance has been widely used as spring steel tool steel and high-speed steel currently steel with the addition of v and v-containing non-ferrous alloys are used to build jet engines machine parts including construction equipment as well as aircraft and automobile components non-iron alloys containing v are also used in space technology and nuclear power industry moreover steel with v was well suited for production of armored fighting vehicles used during the second world war 11 12 13 14 15 16 more details about v-containing steel and alloys which were and still are used to produce various structural components of aircraft weapon rocket engines etc are summarized in the following table table 1
 as shown in fig 3 vanadium is also a potential candidate for therapeutic applications its anti-viral anti-bacterial anti-parasitic anti-fungal anti-cancer anti-diabetic and anti-hyper-cholesterolemic activity and cardioprotective neuroprotective and anti-obesity effects have been arousing interest of many research centers worldwide for many years it has been reported that in human beings pharmacologic amounts of v ie 10 to 100 times higher than the normal intake affect cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism influence the erythrocyte shape and stimulate hepatic glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis 21 in addition v in certain conditions has been found to act as an antioxidant fig 3 as evidenced in animal studies 22 23 24 25 more details about the mechanisms of the pharmacological activity of v are graphically illustrated and summarized in another part of the present report the research on certain aspects of the biological activity of v presented in fig 4
 has demonstrated an essential role of this element in the metabolism of carbohydrates through the effects on the glycolysis glycogenolysis glycogenogenesis and gluconeogenesis pathways lipids by stimulation of lipogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis phospholipids and cholesterol the influence of v on bone mineralization thyroid and erythrocyte metabolism accumulation and transport of calcium in the cell and the synthesis of secondary transmitters mediating in the transduction of intracellular signals is known as well furthermore v also regulates the activity of key enzymes involved in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins kinases and phosphatases taking part not only in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism but also in cell proliferation and differentiation 1242627 with its physiological duality vanadium is essential in trace amounts 005 m and toxic in excess 10 m 2829 fig 5
 its deficit and excessive concentrations can lead to a range of pathologies and cause irreversible damage to various tissues and organs at low concentrations v has been found to exert a beneficial effect on the growth and physiological functions of some microorganisms plants and fungi the essentiality of this element has been demonstrated for bacteria genus azotobacter cyanobacteria genera nostoc and anabaena certain algae genera scenedesmus chlorella fucus and bumilleriopsis brown algae ascophyllum nodosum fungi genera aspergillus culvularia and amanita and lichens 35 36 37 fig 5 a positive effect of v on nitrogen n fixation by azotobacter has been suggested by bortels in 1933 fig 6
 in 1984 and in 1986 v turned out to be essential for the activity of certain enzymes 42 43 44 such as bromoperoxidase brop nitrogenases and chloroperoxidase isolated from algae nitrogen-fixing bacteria and fungus culvularia inaequalis respectively 363745 fig 6 furthermore vanadium has also been recognized as essential for proper growth and development of certain animals 2935 the first suggestion about the essentiality of v for animals appeared in 1949 ie nearly 150 years after the first discovery of this metal after 38 fig 2 about 22 years later in 1971 schwarz and milne hopkins and mohr and strasia reported that v is necessary for rats and chicks fig 6 in turn in 1989 anke and co-authors also reported that v is essential for goats fig 6 in the meantime in 1981 the first review about the physiological and biochemical effects of v was published fig 6 to date symptoms of v deficiency have been described inter alia in birds chickens rats guinea pigs and goats 353846 the most substantive evidence for v essentiality was found in rats and goats after 35 on this basis nielsen and uthus proposed considering vanadium as an essential trace element for proper growth and development of higher animals 38 in contrast the essentiality of this metal for humans is unproven fig 5 although some authors suggest that it is an essential trace element for man 38 mostly because vanadium has broad pharmacological activity which points to the biological importance of this metal the american dietetic association amdassoc considers v as essential in human nutrition after 41 fig 5 nevertheless no symptoms of v deficiency in humans have been described yet the final proof for the essentiality of v for humans requires confirmation of the specific function of this element as in the case of algae or fungi however it is definitely known that the high content of v in the environment and diet is harmful to animals and humans 1 as generally accepted the toxicity of v is dependent on many different factors including the composition of the diet type of the v compound inorganicorganic nature of ligands attached to v complexes valence dose route of entry of this metal into the organism duration of actionexposure and individual and species sensitivity fig 7
 the history of research on the adverse effects of action of this metal dates back to 1876 when priestly described toxicity of v in certain animals fig 6 as regards animals rabbits and guinea pigs were found to be more sensitive to this element than mice and rats 54748 fig 7 in turn a classic paper about the toxic and pharmacologic action of vanadium was written in 1912 and analyses of the content of v in various organisms were initiated 18 years later in 1930 fig 6 it is known that in some conditions v can act as a strong pro-oxidant and interact synergistically with other oxidants enhancing oxidative stress 23149 which in turn can result in many negative consequences including disintegration of cell membranes denaturation of proteins and degradation of dna 50 fig 7 it may also weaken the antioxidant barrier 4951 52 53 and intensify lipid peroxidation lpo 4953 54 55 56 57 58 ie the free radical process underlying one of the mechanisms of cell damage 50 fig 7 in addition v can reduce the thiol status 4959 release some transition metals 60 interact with other elements 495361 and accumulate in certain internal organs including the liver and kidneys 465662 63 64 evoking hepato- and nephrotoxic effects respectively fig 7 in higher concentrations v can also act as a pro-apoptotic factor by induction of oxidative stress and lead to programmed cell death apoptosis with damage to mitochondrial membranes cytochrome c cyt c outflow and activation of caspases and poly adp-ribose polymerase parp 5 fig 7 which plays a role of a cell death promoting factor 65 disorders of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation resulting in a decrease in the level of atp 1 are the other adverse effects of v action fig 7 the mechanisms of toxicity of v require further experimental work as they have not been fully elucidated yet some of them have been reported to be implicated in the adverse effects of v action for example the mechanism by which v produces a reprotoxic effect is believed to be linked to oxidative stress 66 andor actin cytoskeleton damage 67 fig 7 it has been suggested that the hepatotoxic nephrotoxic 486268 69 70 71 cardiotoxic 72 genotoxic 7374 neurotoxic 727576 and carcinogenic 4877 effects of this metal as well as inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the lungs 78 are associated with the pro-oxidative potential of v and its ability to intensify lpo fig 7 it is known that lpo products can stimulate the expression of oncogenes 79 which in turn can lead to transformation of normal cells into cancerous cells fig 7 epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to elevated levels of v may be a risk factor for cancer development 80 studies on an animal model have revealed a positive correlation between the frequency of neoplasia and susceptibility to v-induced inflammation 80 which is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases not only malignant diseases and results from v-induced oxidative stress in turn long-lasting oxidative stress with simultaneous weakening of the antioxidant system present in every living organism can lead to permanent celltissue damage and consequently to initiation of the disease process therefore the generation of reactive oxygen species ros under oxidative stress one of the main factors affecting morbidity can lead to damage to dna and consequently to initiation of carcinogenesis the risk for animal and human health related to exposure to v is largely dependent on the degree of its oxidation state it has been highlighted that v at the highest oxidation state 5 is the most toxic vanadium form 9 one of the compounds of this metal vanadium pentoxide v2o5 which contains v at the highest oxidation state 5 has been reported to easily reach the alveolar surface subsequently enter circulation directly and diffuse in the entire organism inducing diverse injuries 9 the risk of poisoning with the pentavalent v form is constantly growing due to its extensive release into the environment by metallurgical industry chemical plants oil refineries and coal and mazut-fired heating plants 894581 moreover relatively high pollution of the environment with v2o5 is also caused by dust derived from the combustion of liquid and solid fuels as well as municipal waste 1081 resulting in an increased risk of exposure of anyone who lives near such areas consequently the level of this metal in the soil increases in turn higher concentrations of v in the soil lead to more intensive uptake of this metal being by plants due to the lack of a selective mechanism protecting plants against excessive absorption of the element thus v can enter the animal and human organism via the food chain additionally the lack of proper industrial wastewater management containing this metal can be another risk factor for animal and human health 982 in the case of occupational exposure workers repairing thermal power boilers and high-pressure combustion engines as well as those responsible for production of v2o5 and replacement of v-based catalytic converters are the most vulnerable to the most toxic pentavalent form of this metal 9 in the literature occupational exposure to v2o5 is described as the etiological factor of the asthmatic syndrome known as boilermaker disease 83 the most important symptoms of exposure to v via the oral route presented in fig 8
 include gastrointestinal disorders abdominal pain nausea vomiting diarrhea loss of appetite weight reduction and green-black tongue in turn the symptoms of exposure to this metal through inhalation illustrated in the same figure include rhinitis chest pain pharyngitis bronchitis pneumonia bradycardia cough dyspnoea bronchial asthma headache dizziness conjunctivitis blurred vision apathy and depression 9318184 85 86 the most important issues of the metabolism of v and forms in which this metal is present in physiological fluidstissues are collected in fig 9
 as illustrated v consumption which depends on the diet is estimated to be around 1520 gday typical daily dose consumed by humans or 1060 gday daily dose ingested by the us population 887 after intake vanadate mainly as vo4
 reaches the gastrointestinal gi tract and in the acidic environment of the stomach most of the anionic vanadate absorbed more effectively than vo2 is transformed into vanadyl vo2 precipitated to insoluble vanadyl hydroxides vooh2 in the slightly alkaline medium of the intestine and excreted with feces 9498  3339 in turn resorbed v is removed from the organism through kidneys 8788 probably in the form of unidentified complexes with high-protein-bound and low-molecular-weight species vo2-complexes 3889 the level of v in urine is estimated to be around 12  of the intake amount 87 as reported the absorption of v from the gi tract is mainly estimated in the range of 022  although amounts greater than 10  have been indicated to be absorbed as well fig 9 21469293 additionally sanchez et al 94 found an absorption rate of v at the level of 52  in rats treated with bismaltolatooxovanadiumiv bmov 622 mgday in drinking water for five weeks it has been highlighted that such differences may be associated with several factors inter alia the diet composition andor chemical form of ingested v 38 furthermore after entering the bloodstream 8090  of v is bound by albumin alb which plays a pivotal role in the transport of various metals 95 or transferrin tf preferably which is the main v transporter in the blood plasma 833 both tf and alb bind v in the 4 and 5 oxidation state 96 it has been reported that v in the form of vanadyl vo2 tetravalent v4 state binds to tf at the same binding site as the fe3 ion 97 and that v5 for which the cationic form dioxovanadium cation vo2
 has been indicated also occupies the same pockets as fe3 98 studies conducted by azevedo et al 99 have confirmed that both v4 and v5 can bind to apo-tf and holo-tf thus they can be efficiently up-taken by cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis of tf in addition tf can bind viii forming di-vanadiumiii-tf viii2-tf which can be up-taken by cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis as well 100 it has also been reported that v species can enter cells via membrane citrate transporters the lactate transporter and the organic anion transporter organic-at 101 additionally vo2 can be up-taken via passive diffusion 102103 and bound by immunoglobulin g igg or low-molecular components of plasma such as phosphate citrate lactate and oxalate 333991104105 in turn v5 ions such as h2vo4
hvo4
2- can enter cells through anion channels ie phosphate or sulfate channels 106 in cells v5 is reduced to vo2 by some reducing substances such as ascorbic acid and thiol-containing cysteine 107 for instance in erythrocytes rbc v5 is principally reduced by glutathione gsh to vo2 which binds to hemoglobin hb 108109 fig 9 the total content of v in the organism of adults is about 100200 g equivalent to the mean tissue concentration of about 40 nm 6 half of this amount is located in bones which are the major storage pool for long-term v accumulation and where vanadate can substitute phosphate in the mineral hydroxyapatite ca10po46oh2 3337106 fig 9 the other amount is mainly deposited in the liver kidney and spleen 108 due to the importance of these organs in detoxification of the organism and excretion of harmful substances muscles lungs and brain are the other sites of v accumulation 108 fig 9 as regards v speciation most of this metal in the liver is present in the transferrin and low-molecular mass fraction tff and lmmf respectively 108 as well as a vanadyl-ferritin vo2-fer complex 26 the fer-v and lmmf-v fractions have also been identified in the spleen 108 in kidneys v was divided between a high molecular mass fraction hmmf and lmmf additionally an exchangeable fraction of this metal has been indicated 108 fig 7 in turn large amounts of v in the lungs have been identified in the hemoglobin and tf fraction hb-f and tff respectively and in the readily exchangeable fraction 108 fig 9 two titanium alloys with v such as ti-6al-4 v and ti-6al-4 v eli are used as biomedical materials mainly in bone surgery due to their good mechanical properties very high resistance to corrosion and biocompatibility 11 table 2
 in addition 2v-49co-49fe named permendur is another vanadium-containing alloy 2v-49co-49fe with 2  of v is mainly used for production of devices supporting the work of the heart table 2 11 the presence of vanadium in biomedical materials requires our additional comment since implants made of titanium alloys containing v are exposed to body fluids v may be released into surrounding tissues exerting adverse effects the fact that the implant surface has a significant impact on reactions that occur at the implant-tissue interface should also be taken into account therefore the surface layer of the implant is often modified in order to induce a specific reaction of the tissue to the implant in the case of some implants eg orthopedic and dental implants a surface with appropriate bioactivity and roughness is created to achieve rapid osseointegration and a durable connection between biomaterial and tissue 11 as reported layers with varied composition are often applied on the surface of metallic alloys in order to improve the biological activity of the implant and provide an additional barrier against the release of metals from metallic biomaterials 11 for example titanium oxidetio2-based coating containing nano-hydroxyapatite n-ha and silver particles ag is applied on the ti-6al-4 v alloy table 2 120 the tio2 n-ha ag layers are used as bioactive coatings with antimicrobial properties to increase biological activity osseointegration and biochemical stability in implantable medical devices table 2 moreover polymeric v-based coatings made of a polylactide-co-glycolide copolymer plga with antimicrobial activity table 2 122 and a diamond-like layer including v v-dlc are also formed to be used as implant materials 11 table 2 the mechanisms of antibacterial activity of v which have not been fully elucidated yet include a inhibition of the activity of nak-atpase fig 11 26123137143 b generation of ros fig 11 c impact on transport of substrates eg thymidine uridine leucine glucose into the cell through the bacterial cell membrane fig 11 along with induction of potassium k outflow from the cell 137 d interaction with topoisomerase type ii gyrase fig 11 which is necessary for the proper functioning of the genome and bacterial growth with the atp-binding site used as a target for antibacterial drugs 144145 e interaction with dna in an intercalative manner 133 resulting in modification of the dna structure unwinding stiffening and elongation of the double helix with formation of an intercalative complex 146 f interaction with components of the cytoskeleton which results in morphological alterations of bacterial cells thereby preventing proper division 137 and g other nonspecific mechanisms of action fig 11 with emphasis on the better bioavailability of v complexes due to the presence of a specific ligand allowing the complex to penetrate the hydrophobic lipid-rich bacteria wall acc to 123 124 most data in this area were obtained in in vitro studies of the influence of v on human immunodeficiency hiv-1hiv-2 virus 33 some complexes of this element have been shown to inhibit the activity of viral reverse transcriptase rt after33123 which is responsible for the synthesis of dna on the viral rna matrix in the reverse transcription process facilitating integration of the viral dna into the genome of the host cell thus by inhibiting rt activity vanadium blocks viral replication furthermore the binding of v complexes to the cd4 molecule present on the surface of t-helper cells and the chemokine cxcr-4 co-receptor has been suggested as well fig 11 this leads to blockage of the passage of the virus to the host cell after 123 thereby preventing its multiplication and protecting against the development of infection among the mechanisms of the anti-fungal activity of v complexes which likewise the mechanisms of the anti-bacterial and anti-viral activity of this metal have not been fully recognized yet interactions with dna by intercalation have been proposed 133 additionally inhibition of biosynthesis of an important component of the fungal cell membrane ie ergosterol 134 fig 11 by affecting the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of this compound 135 have been suggested the mechanisms of the anti-parasitic activity of vanadium against trypanosomiasis amoebiasis and leishmaniasis mainly suggested in in vitro studies include a intercalation of v complexes into dna fig 11 after 123 anti-tryposomal and anti-amoebiasis activity b inhibition of the activity of phosphatases 125 fig 11 due to the structural similarity of vanadate to phosphate 3945 these enzymes are involved in gluconeogenesis - a metabolic pathway necessary for the growth of leishmania spp 126 c inhibition of the activity of acid phosphatase sacp fig 11 127 which is a virulence factor most commonly secreted by leishmania during growth 128 and d activation of macrophageth1-type response with the release of ros and pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 and il-6 129 capable of destroying intracellular pathogens 147 activity against leishmania among the mechanisms of the antitumor activity of v compoundscomplexes which still require further studies intensified ros generation including iron-induced ros following ferritin disintegration due to v action is suggested 33 fig 11 ros production is commonly known to lead to disturbance in cellular metabolism and damage to lysosomes and mitochondria critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis 148 resulting in activation of caspases and apoptosis 123149150 inhibition of the cell cycle by hyperactivation of the ras-raf-mek-erk pathway is also proposed after 123 fig 11 this pathway activates inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and thus maintains the retinoblastoma protein prb in the hypophosphorylated form capable of blocking the cell cycle 151 the involvement of v in suppressing neoplastic transformation through apoptotic signaling andor cell cycle arrest has also been suggested by chakraborty et al 152 as based on evidence from animal studies moreover focus is placed on a interactions of v with the components of the spindle 123 b intercalation with dna 33 fig 11 c potentiation of anti-proliferative activity 136 d inhibition of the activity of ib topoisomerase top-ib 153 fig 11 capable of relaxing highly twisted dna molecules 154 e inhibition of the activity of neutral endopeptidase nep 155 which inactivates anticancer enkephalins 156 f modulation of phase i andor ii xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes 157 158 159 160 and g alteration of antioxidant status as 158160161 fig 11 a reduction in the gshgssg ratio 153 fig 11 which can lead to intensification of oxidative stress in the cell 49 is highlighted as well additionally some v compounds have been reported to be able to counteract tumor metastasis 155 much attention is still focused on studies of the design of v compounds for cancer treatment as evidenced by recently published articles however all v compoundscomplexes used in these studies were mainly tested in different cell lines not in vivo conditions in an animal model for example the results from a study conducted by ni et al 162 showed that certain multidentate oxovanadiumiv complexes have promising anti-cancer activity against human hepg2 and smmc-7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cells one of these compounds exhibited much more potent anti-tumor properties and turned out to be less toxic to normal human cells than the cisplatin complex it suppressed tumor cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest and directly induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as emphasized by the authors structural elements ie metal components variations of the coordination mode labile water molecules and chelated ligands probably exert an essential cooperative effect on the anti-tumor activity another in vitro study demonstrated that v as oxido-vanadiumiv complex volbipy was able to induce early apoptosis more efficiently in the hepg2 cell line than in normal l929 cells 163 moreover the authors revealed that the rates of necrosislate apoptosis were also induced in the hepg2 cells more potently than in the l929 cells based on these results they suggested that the volbipy complex can be considered as a new strategy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in addition they hypothesized on the basis of studies conducted by other researchers that the volbipy complex may be modified by co-application with an antioxidant to be safer than the administration thereof alone in turn a study reported by kowalski et al 164 revealed that oxidovanadiumiv coordination complexes containing a 2-methylnitrilotriacetate ligand are good candidates for preclinical development of novel anticancer drugs targeting pancreatic cancer as suggested the molecular mechanisms of cytotoxicity of these complexes were dependent on generation of ros and cell cycle arrest in the g2m phase with simultaneous activation of the p53p21 pathway an earlier study conducted by the same author 165 showed a selective cytotoxic effect of v complexes containing phenanthroline and quinoline as organic ligands against a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line panc-1 the results from this work revealed that v complexes caused cell cycle arrest in the g2m phase and induced a significant increase in ros generation in a time- and concentration dependent manner in addition at a higher concentration v complexes induced a mixed type of cell death in panc-1 cells including apoptotic and necroptotic processes 165 the authors emphasize that the type of cell death induced by v complexes is mainly determined by ligands and recommend further studies supporting the therapeutic potential of v in pancreatic cancer treatment in turn data from another research group 166 who examined the effect of a substituent in the hydrazone ligand of a family of -oxidodivanadiumv hydrazone complexes on the structure dna binding and anticancer activity have revealed that v complexes exhibited promising anti-cancer activity against siha cervical cancer cells their experiments demonstrated that these complexes acted in an apoptotic mode and were non-toxic to the normal t293 cell line 166 more recently the anticancer properties of a family of vanadiumv complexes with a diaminotrisphenolato chelating ligand have been explored by reytman et al 167 who demonstrated their promising in vitro efficacy against ht-29 ovcar-3 a2780 a2780cis and a2780adr cells in addition a new promising effect of v compounds involving oncolytic viruses and their potential to combat cancer has recently been suggested the authors reported that the infection of oncolityc viruses in resistant tumor cell lines was enhanced by v compounds 168 as emphasized this is of particular interest because it offers new opportunities for the development of strategies for the treatment of cancer one of the mechanisms suggested for the insulin-like effect of v is linked to the inhibitory action of this element on the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases ptp 123 fig 11 this effect results from the antagonism related to the structural similarity of vanadate anions vo4

3 3945 by inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b ptp-1b responsible for inactivation of the insulin receptor ins-ir which plays a key role in glucose metabolism vanadium contributes to activation of the receptor presumably by preventing dephosphorylation of tyrosine phosphorylated residues of the beta subunit of ins-ir 169 this in turn activates the pi3k-akt pathway 3-phosphatidylinositol kinase pi3-kakt protein kinase responsible for the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids 2 and thus leads to potentiation of insulin-induced signal transduction in consequence the transport of glucose into cells increases 39 fig 11 the inhibitory effect of ros generated by v compounds on the activity of ptp-1b is also proposed 170 fig 11 in addition vanadium a causes an increase in the number of glucose-type 4 glut-4 transporters in the cell membrane 171 fig 11 which allows glucose molecules to be transported to adipocytes and muscle cells 172 b affects the insulin-like growth factor receptor igf-ir by inactivation of associated ptp c activates receptor and non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases ptk d stimulates glycogenogenesis and e inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis 172173 fig 11 it has also been highlighted that the interaction with membranes may be important in the stabilization of v complexes and structural changes in membrane proteins may contribute to their insulin-mimetic mechanisms and toxicities 102 as illustrated in fig 12
 the first report describing certain effects of v action in patients with diabetes mellitus dm appeared in 1899 some 80 years later tolman and co-workers 175 demonstrated that v can directly influence glucose glu metabolism and suggested that it may play a role in the regulation of glu in vitro over the same period other authors reported that v in the form of vanadate and vanadyl can stimulate glu oxidation in rat adipocytes 176177 in turn in 1985 heyliger et al 178 described the antidiabetic properties of v in vivo for the first time since then the number of experiments in an animal model in which some v compounds ie vanadyl sulfate - voso4 vs sodium metavanadate - navo3 smv sodium orthovanadate - na3vo4 were used as potential antidiabetic drugs has been constantly growing for example in 1987 meyerovitch and co-investigators 179 reported that v is able to normalize the blood glu level in vivo model fig 12 besides other authors described the use of v in diabetes mellitus dm fig 12 in 2000 one of the organic v compounds ie bisethylmaltolatooxovanadiumiv beov first synthesized in the late 1990s 180 was used in the first phase i clinical trial in non-diabetic volunteers fig 12 a few years later in 200708 the same v compound was used in a phase iia trial in seven type 2 diabetic subjects 180181 fig 12 however in 2009 the diabetes program was ceased fig 12 akesis pharmaceuticals inc in january 21 2009 announced it has discontinued its sole clinical development program for akp-020 a phase iia drug candidate for the treatment of diabetes mellitus 182 as reported the renal changes resulting from the doses used in the preclinical safety program were the cause of this decision 174 fig 12 vanadium is well-known to be nephrotoxic in vivo data on the effects of this metal on the animal kidney are available in the literature for example a study conducted by de la tore et al 183 showed that certain markers of nephrotoxicity such as the serum creatinine and urea levels as well as the urinary creatinine concentration increased and decreased respectively after v administration compared to the v-untreated animals the creatinine clearance was also found to be lowered in the v-supplied rats 183 moreover v-induced morphologic changes in the kidney and a significant influence of age on the renal effects of this metal were observed as well 183 all those findings gave rise to the following statement the obtained results can be of concern if in the future vanadium compounds can be administered in the treatment of diabetic patients 183 in addition another study in rats demonstrated v-induced kidney fibrosis 184 at glomerular tuft preglomeruli pretubules and interstitium cortex and medulla 185 in turn an earlier study conducted by boscolo et al 186 also showed alterations in the urinary excretion of certain electrolytes in rats chronically treated with v vanadium compoundscomplexes are generally known to exhibit ins-mimetic properties through which they are involved in the regulation of glu metabolism as illustrated on the timeline fig 13
 vanadyl sulfate vs was one of the inorganic v forms most often used in studies with diabetic patients overall the history of these studies dates back to 1995 when cohen and co-workers 187 conducted the first trials on the effects of vs in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus niddm in 1996 halberstam et al 188 and boden et al 189 also used vs in niddm patients fig 13 in turn sodium metavanadate smv was administered in patients with niddm and in those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus iddm by goldfine et al 190191 the researchers used vs in studies with niddm patients in 2000 192 fig 13 in the subsequent years ie in 2001 193 2008 194 and 2013 195 vs was applied in studies with niddm obese and iddm patients respectively fig 13 it has been estimated that the dose of v capable of normalizing the glu level in the blood of rodents is about 100 mg vkgday at the level of v in the blood within the range of 1020 m the same effect in humans was achieved at a dose of 15 mg vkgday at the level of v in the blood within the range of 15 m 30 fig 14
 to sum up the highest scientific interest was devoted to studies on the potential use of vanadium in the treatment of diabetes which is related to its antidiabetic properties positive results of administration of v compounds were demonstrated both in diabetic animals and in human patients with regard to various animal models of diabetes many reports in this research area have been published and there are ongoing studies focused on this issue as evidenced by the works by adam et al 196 and kroniak et al 197 briefly adams research group focused on the synthesis of a new anti-diabetic complex containing vanadiumiv and vitamin a the authors showed a reduced blood glucose level a lowered creatinine concentration and a decrease in the activity of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase gpt in the serum of diabetic mice treated with a viv-vitamin a complex compared to the untreated diabetic mice group in turn data from mouse studies conducted by kroniak et al 197 in which the influence of eight new v compounds on organs mass were tested revealed that v complexes had a remarkably different effect on organ weight despite the similar composition and the same co-ligand as stressed by the authors this may point to separate metabolic pathways of these compounds in the body and a role of tridentate l schiff base ligands more recently a report has been published by szklarzewicz et al 198 showing studies that compared v complexes with diverse structures and correlated them with their properties the investigators synthesized three new complexes of this metal at three different oxidation levels iii iv and v with schiff base ligands showing differences in the coordination of the metal with the ligand in order to compare their physicochemical and spectroscopic properties as potential antidiabetic drugs as far as application of v in diabetic patients is concerned this may be a considerable problem and may pose a risk of toxicity as this element is highly toxic and is able to accumulate and interact with other metals a summary of its serious side effects including tissue v accumulation in experimental animals in rats with diabetes treated with this metal orally was reviewed in the work by domingo et al 62 other reports by domingo 48199 provided a summary of side effects derived from the oral administration of v compounds observed in diabetic patients as known such diseases as diabetes mellitus or cancer are chronic diseases requiring chronic treatment therefore as emphasized by the author the long-termchronic administration of v may be unavoidable and can lead to long-term side effects resulting from significant tissue v accumulation thus the toxicity of v that could derive from the chronic treatment with this element is of particular concern hence researchers 174199 question the legitimacy of the possible application of v in oral diabetes therapy fig 13 moreover as stressed by some investigators 168 it also has to be kept in mind that diabetes mellitus is sometimes characterized as a metabolic disease with which patients live for many years therefore low toxicity of potential drugs should be of particular concern the results of previous studies on both organic and inorganic v compounds have shown that this element can act as a cardioprotective agent it may protect the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury prevent hypertension and hypertrophy of myocardium and improve heart performance 200 inhibition of ptp activity and activation of the 3-phosphatidylinositol kinase pi3-kakt protein kinase signaling pathway pi3k-akt have been proposed as mechanisms responsible for v-induced cardioprotection 200 fig 11 akt known as protein kinase b pkb is responsible for the phosphorylation of many different proteins involved in basic cellular processes such as proliferation growth migration and metabolism 201 and plays an important role in the regulation of myocardial hypertrophy and in angiogenesis acc to 33 activation of the pi3k-akt pathway results in the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos responsible for catalyzing nitric oxide no production fig 11 in turn as an initiator and mediator of cardioprotection no has anti-hypertrophic activity and plays an important role in the regulation of vasorelaxation 202203 diffusion of no from the endothelium to vascular smooth muscle activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp which inhibits the influx of ca2 ions into the cell andor the activity of the calcium pump ca2-atpase and activates potassium channels leading to vasodilation 202 furthermore stimulation of glucose transport by the influence of v on the glut-4 glucose transporters fig 11 resulting in normalization of their level in myocardial cells 204 is another mechanism of the v cardioprotective action 200 proposed in studies conducted on rats with pharmacologically induced diabetes in addition vanadium as vanadate which shows pro-hypertensive properties 186 can induce vascular smooth muscle contraction acting as a vasoconstrictive agent by increasing the intracellular calcium ca2 concentration 205 fig 11 in vivo studies carried out on smooth muscle isolated from guinea pigs airways 206 have shown that the inhibition of the activity of the sodium-potassium pump nak-atpase by this element 143 does not seem to be linked to the mechanism responsible for smooth muscle contractility 206 a vasoconstrictive effect has also been demonstrated for vanadyl for which a different mechanism of action was suggested compared to that proposed for vanadate 207 in addition vanadium as vanadyl may also have an anti-hypertensive effect as demonstrated by studies conducted on spontaneously hypertensive rats shr and in those with hypertension induced by a fructose-rich diet fhr rats receiving vanadyl sulfate voso4 or bismaltolatooxavanadiumiv bmov 208 209 210 in terms of mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of v it has been speculated that this element activates the pi3k-akt signaling pathway survival signals by inhibiting ptp thereby inactivating forkhead box class o foxos family members such as fkhr fkhrl1 afx and finally resulting in suppression of expression of apoptosis-inducing factors such as bim and fas ligands fasl it has also been assumed to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk 211 212 213 214 215 fig 11 in vivo studies in a rodent model on rats have shown that v administered in the form of bmov leads to an increase in the intake of v and a decrease in the water and food intake body weight and serum leptin lep concentration leps 216 fig 15
 the influence of this metal on the signaling pathway through lep jak2stat3 pathway 217218 was suggested as a mechanism underlying these changes 216 fig 15 it is believed that the increase in the activity of ptp-1b blocks janus tyrosine kinase 2 jak2 ie a substrate for ptp-1b 219220 resulting in blockage of leptin signaling jak2stat3 and cascades of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pi3-k involved in the signaling pathway of both insulin ins and leptin lep 220221 fig 15 therefore the signal from ins and lep is blocked fig 15 in turn by inhibition of the activity of ptp-1b 222 vanadium leads to activation of the jak2stat3 leptin signaling pathway 217218 fig 15 and thus inhibits the synthesis of neuropeptide y npy and its release in the hypothalamus consequently appetite body fat mass and body weight are reduced 221223 fig 15 there is also an increase in leptin lep-s and insulin ins-s sensitivity and a decrease in insulin ins-r and leptin lep-r resistance 138218220224 fig 15 ins-r which causes disturbances in the synthesis of lipoproteins and their changes in blood plasma 225 along with lep-r and lep-r-related hyperleptinemia hyper-lep have been reported to be significant risk factors of hypertension type ii diabetes dyslipidemia atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases 138226227 fig 15 thus by affecting the activity of ptp-1b v induces the jak2stat3 signaling pathway which improves sensitivity to lep and ins and makes this element as suggested useful for treating obesity 138217218 an increase in ins-s was found in diabetic rats receiving vanadyl sulfate voso4 for 30 days 228 and in type i and ii diabetes patients after administration of sodium metavanadate navo3 for 2 weeks 190 noteworthy is also the fact that through its direct influence on the organization of membrane lipids and cholesterolsphingolipid-rich microdomains where proteins involved in signal transduction are concentrated eg the ins receptor v enhances the effects caused by ins and consequently results in ins-r reduction 229 a decrease in ins-r was demonstrated in obese rats fafa zucker rats receiving v in the form of an organic derivative bmov for 6 weeks 230 and in hypertensive rats chronically treated with voso4 209 both v compounds were administered in drinking water the mechanism of the anti-hypercholesterolemic action of v is related to the effect of this element on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway shown in fig 16
 in vitro studies have demonstrated that v can inhibit the synthesis of this steroid 231 by blocking the utilization of mevalonate 232233 which is formed from 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme a 3-hmg-coa in a reaction catalyzed by hmg-coa reductase and further transformed into isopentenyl-5-pyrophosphate ipp in phosphorylationdecarboxylation reactions 234 fig 16i an increase in the catabolism of cholesterol by v is another possible mechanism of action of this element 235 fig 16i the impact of v on stimulation of the lipoprotein lipase lpl activity has been highlighted as well 29236 the lpl enzyme controls many metabolic processes eg it participates in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins 237 thus any disorders in its proper functioning during ins-r 211 result in development of atherosclerosis obesity and type ii diabetes 237 unfavorable changes have been found in the lipid profile of individuals that are occupationally exposed to v working in production of v-containing steel fig 16ii there was an increase in the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl-c and apolipoprotein a apo-ai main hdl apolipoprotein in the serum and a decrease in such atherogenic indices as tchdl-c ldl-chdl-c and apobapoa-i 238 fig 16ii a decrease in cholesterol andor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl-c have also been found in the serum of type ii diabetes patients after 6 weeks of administration of voso4 192193 and in type i and ii diabetes mellitus patients after 2-week treatment with sodium metavanadate navo3 191 fig 16iii a reduced cholesterol level has been demonstrated in the blood of healthy rats receiving v2o5 056 mg v2o5kg once a month for 12 months 78 in obese rats fafa zucker rats treated with sodium orthovanadate na3vo4 08 mgml in drinking water for 4 months 239 and in diabetic rats receiving voso4 075 mgml 1 mgml 11 mgml or 05 mmolkgday 240 241 242 243 sodium metavanadate navo3 020 mgml sodium orthovanadate na3vo4 050 mgml 241 or organic v complexes such as v5dipic-nh2 01 mgml 244 or biscurcuminooxavanadyl bcov 005 01 or 02 mmolkgday 243 in drinking water for different periods 20 days 2 4 and 10 weeks or 5 months in turn a decrease in the level of triglycerides tg in the blood was found a in obese rats fafa zucker rats receiving na3vo4 08 mgml in drinking water for 4 months 239 b in obese non-diabetic zucker fatty rats zf and diabetic zucker fatty rats zdf after administration of organic maltolic vanadium derivatives ie bismaltolatooxovanadiumiv bmov 019 mmolkgday in drinking water and bisethylmaltolatooxovanadiumiv beov 01 mmolkgday with a probe respectively for 3 weeks 245 and c in diabetic rats receiving voso4 240242 243 244 v5dipic-nh2 244 or bcov 243 bcov has also been shown to reduce the serum ldl level significantly in these animals 243 given the increasing practical application of v in medicine and the fact that accumulation of this metal in certain internal organstissues during the treatment of chronic diseases may be a significant problem it is still advisable to carry out studies on v toxicity and mechanisms of its toxic action fig 17
 it is also necessary to study the pharmacological activity of v as well as the mechanisms of absorption and excretion thereof moreover the mechanisms of transport of v to target organs and its uptake by cells as well as the in vivo form of this metal and its influence on the immune system deserve further exploration fig 17 the mechanisms of immune response upon v exposure should also be better clarified additionally comprehensive research on the interactions of v with other elements is needed as well fig 17 metal interactions affecting the cell metabolism action of organs and consequently the function of the entire organism is still an important issue in toxicology pharmacology and medicine therefore examination of the consequences character and mechanisms of interactions of v which raises hopes for the use thereof in the treatment of certain diseases in humans with elements especially those with antioxidant potential in an in vivo experimental model are still a current and vital issue moreover considering the well-known pro-oxidant properties of v the fact that the increased generation of ros and oxidative stress play a crucial role in v-induced toxicity and the suggestions of other authors that the hepatotoxic nephrotoxic cardiotoxic genotoxic neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects of this metal as well as inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the lungs are associated with its redox-active nature and ability to intensify lpo see fig 7 detailed investigations to evaluate the consequences of possible interactions of v with antioxidant elements during combined chronic treatment are even more desirable this aspect is also important in the context of occupational exposure and growing environmental pollution with v the results of studies conducted in a rodent model by cibior et al 57 showed protective action of mg against the pro-oxidant activity of v they also provided evidence that the beneficial mg-induced limitation of the increase in the hepatic lpo during the administration of v may result from the independent action of mg and from the antagonistic interaction with v these effects were observed when healthy rats were exposed to v as smv at the concentration of 0125 mg vl with supplementation with mg as ms at the concentration of 006 mg mgml for 18 weeks however further studies are needed to explain the exact mechanisms accounting for the protective effect of mg at the dose used against the v-induced oxidative stress in the liver the other findings reported by cibior et al 52 demonstrated a markedly reduced level of lpo in the bone of healthy rats supplemented with mg as ms during the 12-week smv exposure 0125 mg vml these changes as those mentioned previously for the liver were also influenced by the independent action of mg and by its antagonistic interaction with v moreover the distinct trend toward the antagonistic interaction between v and mg was revealed with regard to the level of lpo in the erythrocytes of healthy rats exposed to smv 0125 mg vml during 12-week ms supplementation 006 mg mgml 53 it should be added that the concentration of v mentioned above was selected based on earlier studies conducted by other researchers 246 247 248 249 250 who tested similar v concentrations in a rat model as well as reports of the levels of this metal in the blood and urine of occupationally exposed people 251252 which were comparable with those noted in smv-exposed rats based on the results obtained it can be concluded that the issues related to the interactions of v with mg as one of the elements with antioxidant potential are important not only for extending the knowledge of the mechanism of the effect of v on the organism they are also essential to improve the understanding of the role of mg in prevention of v toxicity and clarify the mechanisms underlying the potential protective action of this bioelement in v poisoning this is even more relevant in view of the fact that long-lasting oxidative stress with simultaneous weakening of the antioxidant system can lead to permanent celltissue damage and consequently to initiation of the disease process in addition the examination of the combined v-mg effects in mammalian organisms may also be helpful for the future safe use of v in medicinal applications undisputed is the fact that recognition of doses of elements showing synergisticantagonistic action towards each other may play a role in both medicine and pharmacology however although some studies cited above reveal that supplementation with mg during v exposure has beneficial effects reflected in reduction of the level of lpo in certain cellstissues of healthy rats further studies in other animal models have to be conducted to recognize whether the antagonistic effects of mg on pharmacological amounts of v will allow v to exert beneficial effects or whether their synergistic actions yield beneficial effects at lower amounts of v some time ago matsuda et al 253 demonstrated for the first time that v and mg administered in combination as smv 03 mgml and ms 03 mgml respectively to diabetic rats in drinking water for 3 weeks had a synergistic effect as they augmented whole-body insulin sensitivity and glycogen synthesis based on these findings the authors suggested a potential role for combination therapy with trace elements in type 2 diabetes mellitus and other insulin-resistant states diabetes is accompanied by changes in the level of mg in tissues 254 and by weakening of the antioxidant barrier 255 and oxidative stress 256 with regard to this issue sanchez et al 94 showed that treatment with v of mg-deficient rats corrected many alterations generated by mg deficiency subsequently bermdez-pea et al 257 evaluated whether v treatment might affect alterations in mg metabolism associated with diabetes the authors revealed the existence of interplay or other interactions between both elements in diabetic rats as they stressed these results might help to clarify the role of v as an anti-diabetic agent the existing literature comprises a few articles about the interactions between v and mg 51 52 53576394253257 258 259 260 which has been reported to be able to protect against the harmful effects of ros 261 262 263 264 a summary of data about the interactions between both metals demonstrated to date in relation to parameters investigated in a rodent model is presented in fig 18

 suggesting that metals with similar chemical and physical properties would interact with each other biologically after 265 in 1982 georgievskii described synergistic and antagonistic interactions between certain elements whereas o del defined the term interaction in 1997 after 265 fig 19 studies on the influence of combined administration of v and elements with antioxidant potential date back to 1966 when berg 258 described the effect of co-administration of v with mg on the growth and mortality in chicks fig 19 in 1989 yamaguchi et al 266 reported that zn prevented the toxic effect of v fig 19 in the late 1990s two reports described the effect of se on v toxicity in different regions of the rat brain 267 and a synergistic interaction between v and mg on glucose metabolism in diabetic rats 253 additionally the influence of combined administration of v with zn or se to rats 268 has been described fig 19 the research on the interactions of v with antioxidant elements has been gaining popularity since 2005 since that time more reports have appeared about the effects of co-application of v with criii 59269 270 271 272 or mg 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 5863259260 to rats fig 19 moreover there have also been reports on the effect of v administered as bmov on bioavailability biochemical parameters in serum excretion and content of v and mg in certain internal organstissues of healthy rats receiving v-containing feed and varying levels of mg magnesium oxide mgo 94 and the effect of v bmov on the metabolism and distribution of mg and some biochemical blood parameters in diabetic rats receiving feed containing v and mg mgo 257 it should also be added that more attention should be given to studies on treatment with v in association with compounds with antioxidant properties to optimize the therapeutic potential of v compounds and minimize their possible side effects this is even more relevant in view of the work conducted by wang et al 273 who showed that the treatment with n-acetylcysteine nac ie a thiol antioxidant reducing the accumulation of ros and oxidative damage 274 inhibited v-induced ros generation in human normal liver l02 cells but did not attenuate the antitumor activity of v in human hepatoma hepg2 cells as emphasized by the authors these results may be helpful in the therapeutic application of v compounds along with antioxidants as synergistic agents in order to reduce their potential toxicities in normal cells without affecting their antitumor activities in cancer cells in addition the same researchers suggest that combined administration of v with an antioxidant might be beneficial for diabetes therapy 273 recently protective action of pyruvate against v-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity has been demonstrated in chinese hamster ovary cho-k1 cells 275 it has been suggested that the antioxidative effects of pyruvate especially its ability to neutralize hydrogen peroxide may be involved in the observed mechanism of protection to sum up comprehensive investigations in an animal model on the interactions of v with antioxidant elements such as mg or certain compounds with antioxidant properties or dietaryplant-derived antioxidants are particularly important they would allow us not only to recognize a potential antidote minimizing the adverse effects of v resulting from its strong pro-oxidative activity but also to evaluate the potential efficacy of combined v-mg treatment in certain modern-age diseases due to its multidirectional biological activity and a wide range of effects on the mammalian organism vanadium has been arousing interest of many research centers worldwide for many years the use of this metal in medicine is of particular concern some v compoundscomplexes have been found to be promising for potential therapeutic use their beneficial therapeutic properties have been reported and diseases of interest against which they could be effective have been suggested the number of studies on the use of v in medicine is constantly growing and its potential medical application remains an open question given the recent progress in the research on the pharmacological activity of different v compoundscomplexes it can be assumed that new v-based drugs will be available for therapeutic purposes in the future recently much attention has been focused on the design of v compounds that can be useful for potential applications as anticancer agents there are also ongoing studies on different anti-diabetic v complexes for their future safe use in the treatment of diabetes on the other hand however many multidirectional studies on v which has a narrow therapeutic index have shown that further analyses are still required for this element to be used as a metallodrug in the fight against certain life-threatening modern-age diseases it has been highlighted that the ability of v to accumulate and its strong toxicological potential are an important obstacle limiting the use of this metal in pharmacology therefore it would be advisable to shift the balance towards the beneficial action of v whose pharmacological potential has repeatedly been revealed as evidenced by the results of many studies conducted in a variety of different cell lines and in animal models however this is a serious challenge and considerable research is still devoted to design v complexes with low toxicity and sufficiently high efficacy besides the issues mentioned above and those presented in section 9 titled vanadium - important research trends and the need to identify the susceptibility of different cellstissues to the effects of v the following aspects draw researchers attention a identification of v species as an important factor in the assessment of toxicity of this element and its potential health risks to humans 276 fig 20

al 2009 in contrast to these efforts the supramap web application provides a complete workflow including parallel direct optimization of raw data into trees and implied alignments tree projection into a keyhole markup language kml file and character diagnosis with presentation of mutation or other character change data implied by the phylogeny for each node of the tree the diagnosis functionality is similar to a user performing character mapping on a traditional cladogram using the trace character history feature in mesquite or map characters feature in tnt goloboff et al 2008 in the case of supramap character changes are optimized on the projected tree thus supramap enables character evolution studies in biogeographic and temporal contexts below we include a case study for character evolution in hypothesis driven research on the spread of key mutations in lineages of infectious diseases janies et al 2007 2008 hill et al 2009 supramap is distinct from all the efforts described above in that it is both a client and a web service that is instantiated on a computing cluster freely available for use by the scientific community in this respect supramap resembles the raxml webserver stamatakis et al 2008 httpphylobenchvital-itchraxml-bb or swami rifaieh et al 2007 httpwwwphyloorgportal2 in that a phylogenetic search application is spawned via a web interface to a computing cluster raxml requires the user to upload a precomputed alignment in contrast supramap does not require an alignment although it can use prealigned data if the user prefers a typical supramap run performs integrated alignment and phylogenetic analysis as implemented in poy varn et al 2009 swami supports poy but not the geographical projection capabilities of supramap many services for syndromic surveillance of infectious diseases are available these services scrape filter and map news or search data from the internet on the occurrence of disease symptoms brownstein et al 2008 ginsberg et al 2008 supramap complements these services syndromic surveillance is patientcentric whereas supramap is pathogencentric as supramap focuses on genomic and geographic data it allows the user to understand the key mutations and pathogen phenotypes as diseases spread over time geography and among hosts including animals and humans like syndromic data pathogen genomic data are a key source of medical intelligence that aid public health officials in controlling an outbreak of disease for example in the early days of the sars epidemic the cases were reported as atypical pneumonia which often indicates a bacterial agent only through serological microscopic and nucleotide sequence characterization was it understood that sars was caused by a previously undiscovered coronavirus cov ksiazek et al 2003 furthermore it was not until the full genome of sarscov was sequenced shared and compared via phylogenetics to related coronaviruses from a variety of animals that the zoonotic origins of sarscov could be put in the evolutionary and geographic context necessary for disease surveillance guan et al 2003 marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 janies et al 2008 in this report we focus on the implementation and use of supramap to track the evolution of phenotypes and mutations in sequence data derived from h5n1 influenza over time hosts and geography supramap has been used to visualize the spread of pathogens carrying key mutations that confer the ability of the pathogen to replicate in novel host species or to resist drugs janies et al 2007 2008 hill et al 2009 studies in natural history and anthropology are also underway with supramap the supramap server consists of two main elements the first is a web service created via a jboss application server httpwwwjbossorg the web service executes poy processes and generates kml files on the cluster the second is a client written in ruby using the ruby on rails framework httpwwwrubyonrailsorg a phusion passenger httpwwwmodrailscom server supports the client both elements use mysql httpwwwmysqlcom as the data store we have created a web interface where users can upload data files name projects and organize sets of data files into jobs to be executed the user may study one or many loci and set up various types of analyses by choosing from uploaded files we post a detailed manual httpsupramaposuedusmsupramaptutorials once the user starts a job the supramap system will perform a phylogenetic analysis using dynamic homology integrated alignment and tree search wheeler et al 2006 generate a tree and kml file and present statistics on the run statistics include the optimal tree cost found during the search and the number of times this tree cost was hit if the user prefers multiple sequence alignment and or tree search can be precomputed locally with edit costs search heuristics and optimality criterion specified by the user then the user can upload aligned data and or a tree and use the supramap web service for character diagnosis and tree projection resulting in a kml file the algorithm that generates the kml file computes three data points altitude longitude and latitude for each node of the tree the altitude of each node is calculated by multiplying its tree height by a constant janies et al 2007 the root node is assigned the highest altitude internal nodes are lower and terminal nodes have an altitude of zero leaf nodes of the tree represent observed taxa eg viral isolates whose gis coordinates are found in the csv file the algorithm must compute the latitude and longitude of the internal nodes which represent common ancestors in a post order traversal of the tree each nodes latitude and longitude equals the calculated geographical midpoint of its two children once the geographical data have been computed for the tree the algorithm generates the kml tags includes apomorphy data in the popup windows of the kml and writes a kml file that is viewable with a gis fig 1 a heuristic minimum length tree found by the poy search is presented to the user as a text file with taxa in nested parentheses this file can be viewed with a flat tree viewer such as treeview page 2001 the results of the tree projected onto the earth are presented to the user as a kml file suitable for viewing with a variety of software including google earth httpearthgooglecom arcgis explorer httpwwwesricomsoftwarearcgisexplorerindexhtml nasa worldwind httpworldwindarcnasagov and google maps httpmapsgooglecom we used 239 nucleotide sequences for the polymerase basic 2 genomic segment of recent isolates of h5n1 influenza these isolates represent a sample of the diversity of lineages spreading westward from china across russia the middle east africa and europe we chose the strain agooseyunnan33152005 as an outgroup this strain was discovered to be the most closely related isolate to the root of the westward clade in our analyses of datasets that contained much more background data including many isolates from china japan korea and south east asia ranging back to 1996 for character evolution studies we chose two characters one character was chosen to illustrate host data ie avian feline human mustelid or an environmental isolate and another character was chosen for amino acid genotypes ie glutamic acid or lysine for position 627 of polymerase basic protein 2 pb2 when the pb2 protein contains lysine at position 627 the influenza virus is able replicate in the lower temperature relative to avian of the mammalian respiratory tract tarendeau et al 2008 the phylogenetic analysis found a single best tree of length 1528 steps the tree in the visualization suggests that h5n1 lineages carrying lysine627 in pb2 are spreading westward fig 1 for raw data results and an interactive kml file see httpsupramaposuedusmsupramappublications we used the concentrated changes test cct maddison 1990 to provide an independent check on two hypotheses generated by the visualization and tree the cct is a measure of covariation between two binary characters on a phylogenetic tree the cct was calculated using macclade maddison and maddison 2003 as the tree and the number of changes are large we used a simulation of 500 000 iterations we examined covariation in shifts from avian to mammalian hosts and mutations from glutamic acid e to lysine k at position 627 of the pb2 protein e627k we also examined covariation of the spread of the virus west of 100 east longitude with e627k mutations in the tree resulting from analysis of 239 pb2 sequences there are eight shifts from avian to mammal hosts for h5n1 influenza and eight e627k mutations two of the eight avian to mammal host shifts are coincident with e627k mutations we found a correlation cct  00059 between the shift from avian to mammalian hosts and the e627k mutation the westward movement of the virus is less well correlated with e627k cct  00289 the virus is highly mobile eastward and westward there are 16 easttowest transitions and two of these transitions are coincident with e627k mutations this leads to the higher cct value as we conducted two tests we adjusted for multiple testing using a bonferroni correction resulting in a cutoff of 0025 for statistical significance based on this cutoff avian to mammal host shifts in h5n1 are significantly correlated with e627k mutations although close to the cutoff the westward spread of the virus is not significantly correlated with e627k mutations the supramap workflow initially depended on using extensible stylesheet language xsl transformations xslt to filter and convert results from poy to kml this information includes the tree structure and character changes associated with each branch in nested elements however xslt processing is memory intensive trees with large numbers of isolates and character changes can exceed the memory available and prevent the process from completing xslt to address the limitations of xslt we have implemented plugins for poy the plugin contains functions that perform the kml generation inside poy thus the user can complete the entire supramap workflow using poy as a standalone application no xslt steps are needed using plugins the data are kept in memory that is allocated to the poy process and used therein for calculating and generating the kml visualization the use of a workflow that is entirely contained within poy has the disadvantage over the webbased application in that the user has to learn the command line syntax of poy and use their local computing resources however an important issue in research on emergent infectious diseases is data security one solution to this problem is that users can run a binary of poy enabled via plugins for kml generation on local computers without the use of a remote cluster and without transmission of their data outside of their organization we include instructions for the web and standalone implementations of supramap and poy projection of precomputed trees and colouring tree branches in kml at this web page httpsupramaposuedusmsupramaptutorials we hope that our tools will complement data sharing efforts such as nihs genbank httpncbinlmnihgov and the global initiative on sharing all influenza data httpgisaidorg in supramap we share powerful software tools and computing via an easytouse interface our overarching goal is to build communities of researchers and public health officials to leverage combined strengths and expertise to fight infectious diseases once produced and shared kml encoded maps can be layered in a gis layering pathogen phylogenies with other data such as host distributions transit systems and environmental conditions will provide a common analytical framework in which a multidisciplinary team can work to understand the origin and spread of emergent diseases  endangered wild salmon infected by newly discovered viruses gideon mordecai j kristina

salmon oncorhynchus spp species have supported coastal ecosystems and indigenous populations surrounding the north pacific ocean for tens of millennia today through their anadromous life history

cause of great concern to indigenous groups commercial and recreational fishers and the general public although the exact number of salmon spawning in rivers is unknown there are large declines in sockeye salmon over a large geographic area peterman and dorner 2012 similarly chinook salmon stocks are at only a small percentage of their historic levels and more than 50 stocks are extinct heard et al 2007 it is thought that infectious disease may contribute to salmon declines miller et al 2011 but little is known about infectious agents especially viruses endemic to pacific salmon infectious disease has been identified as a potential factor in poor early marine survival in migratory salmon an immune response to viruses has been associated with mortality in wild migratory smolts and adults miller et al 2011 jeffries et al 2014 and in unspecified mortalities of salmon in marine net pens in british columbia bc miller et al 2017 di cicco et al 2018 for instance immune responses to viruses such as infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv and potentially undiscovered viruses have been associated with mortality in wild juvenile salmon jeffries et al 2014 this is an important observation as mortality of juvenile salmon can be as high as 90 transitioning from fresh water to the marine environment clark et al 2016 together these suggest that there are undiscovered viruses which may contribute to decreased survival of pacific salmon but a concerted effort to look for viruses that may contribute to mortality has been absent here virus-discovery was implemented to screen for viruses associated with mortality together sequencing of dead or moribund aquaculture salmon and live-sampled wild salmon in-situ hybridization and epidemiological surveys revealed that previously unknown viruses some of which are associated with disease infect wild salmon from different populations fish were screened against a viral disease detection biomarker panel vdd that elucidates a conserved transcriptional pattern indicative of an immune response to active rna viral infection miller et al 2017 for instance in a previous study we showed that 31 of moribund atlantic salmon were in a viral disease state and half of these were not known to be positive for any known rna viruses di cicco et al 2018 individuals that were strongly vdd-positive but negative for any known salmon viruses eg piscine orthoreovirus erythrocytic necrosis virus infectious pancreatic necrosis virus infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus infectious salmon anaemia virus and pacific salmon paramyxovirus were subject to metatranscriptomic sequencing the sequencing revealed viral transcripts belonging to members of the arenaviridae nidovirales and reoviridae three evolutionarily divergent groups of rna viruses figure 1 that can be highly pathogenic yun and walker 2012 liang et al 2014 weiss and leibowitz 2011 one of the challenges of viral discovery in fish is that the proportion of viral transcripts in vertebrate metatranscriptomic libraries is small compared to the number of transcripts from the host and other contaminating sequences geoghegan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however we were able to achieve near-coding complete genomes for the three new viruses figure 1figure supplement 1a and b the genomic organisation of the newly discovered viruses was consistent with related viruses in fish for instance spav has three genomic segments as shown for other arenaviruses in fish shi et al 2018 high-throughput rt-pcr screening of 6000 wild juvenile chinook and sockeye salmon showed dissimilar geographical distributions of infected fish reflecting differences in epidemiological patterns of transmission and infection dynamics for each of the viruses figure 2 the distribution and abundance of the different viruses varied markedly arenaviruses were relatively common figure 2figure supplement 1 and geographically widespread in migratory juvenile chinook and sockeye salmon in the marine environment figure 2 figure 2figure supplement 2 whereas the nidovirus was spatially localised and predominantly observed at high prevalence over multiple years in chinook salmon leaving freshwater hatcheries figure 2 finally the reovirus was detected only in farmed chinook salmon figure 2 and figure 2figure supplement 1 with the exception of their relatively recent discovery in snakes stenglein et al 2012 and frogfish shi et al 2018 arenaviruses were thought to solely infect mammals the arenaviruses reported here share less than 15 amino-acid sequence similarity in the rdrp to those from mammals and snakes and define a new monophyletic evolutionary group the pescarenaviruses figure 1a the absence of clear sequence homology in the glycoprotein the difference in genome segmentation shi et al 2018 as well as phylogenetic analysis of the replicase demonstrate that pescarenaviruses share a common but ancient ancestor with arenaviruses infecting snakes and mammals we recommend these fish-infecting arenaviruses are assigned to the new genus pescarenavirus with those infecting chinook and sockeye salmon being assigned to the species salmon pescarenavirus spav strains 1 and 2 respectively farmed chinook salmon positive for spav-1 displayed pathology and symptoms consistent with disease including inflammation of the spleen and liver as well as tubule necrosis and hyperplasia in the kidney clinically salmon presented with yellow fluid on the pyloric caeca and swim bladder pale gills with haemorrhaging on the surface and anaemia wild chinook and sockeye that tested positive for arenavirus infection but which were clinically healthy when sampled showed few histological lesions in-situ hybridization revealed that arenaviruses were concentrated mainly in macrophage-like cells melanomacrophages red-blood cells rbcs and endotheliocytes figure 3 these findings are consistent with localisation of arenaviruses in mammals and snakes although in contrast to snakes and fish mammalian red blood cells are not nucleated so the similarity likely only extends to nucleated cells spav-1 and 2 shared similar cell tropism within chinook and sockeye salmon respectively figure 3figure supplement 1 in one out of the eight chinook samples examined moderate chronic-active hepatitis was reported and staining for spav-1 was identified in the area affected by inflammation figure 3c and d while in the other samples spav-1 was confined to reticuloendothelial cells in the liver tissue or in the sinusoids more lesions were observed in dead farmed chinook where disease progression is more advanced our observations indicate that arenaviruses are replicating in red-blood cells and occur in the macrophages and leukocytes that consume the infected cells moreover the observed pathological changes in arenavirus-infected fish including anaemia and lesions in the gills kidney and liver would be expected for viruses that infect red-blood cells these results are the first empirical evidence for arenavirus infection in fish and suggest that spav like many other arenaviruses has the potential to be a causative agent of disease sequencing of cultured chinook salmon also revealed a previously undescribed nidovirus and reovirus phylogenetic analysis of the reovirus named chinook aquareovirus cav predicts that it is part of the genus aquareovirus figure 1b rather than being most closely related to known reoviruses of salmon winton et al 1981 cav groups with a growing number of aquareoviruses some of which are known to cause haemorrhagic disease and have led to serious losses to aquaculture in china nibert and duncan 2013 wang et al 2012 the observed clinical signs anemia dark spleen and blood-filled kidneys in dead farmed chinook salmon with high loads of cav are consistent with a haemorrhagic manifestation the novel nidovirus named pacific salmon nidovirus psnv is most closely related to the recently described microhyla alphaletovirus 1 which forms a sister group to the coronaviruses bukhari et al 2018 this sequence alongside psnv are basal to all other nidovirus families and their long branch length suggests they each belong to a different genus figure 1c while not all coronaviruses cause serious disease many do such as sars and mers which cause severe respiratory infections de wit et al 2016 both spav-1 and spav-2 were relatively widespread along the coast of southwestern british columbia in ocean caught chinook and sockeye salmon currently it is unclear what is driving differences in spav-1 and spav-2 prevalence among regions but the virus appears to be transmitted to juvenile salmon throughout southern bc soon after they enter the ocean a period known to be critical to their survival beamish et al 2012a spav-1 was also relatively common in farmed chinook populations the distribution of spav-1 in wild chinook populations was more localised to the west coast of vancouver island than spav-2 which was most prevalent on the east coast of vancouver island near the discovery islands and the johnstone strait and was rarely detected in sockeye salmon in northern bc and alaska figure 2figure supplement 2 on the east coast of vancouver island the johnstone strait and discovery islands have been identified as a potential choke point for the growth and survival of juvenile salmonids healy et al 2017 the availability of prey to juvenile sockeye in the northern johnstone strait is extremely low resulting in food limitation and increased competition for prey beamish et al 2012a mckinnell et al 2014 godwin et al 2015 godwin et al 2018 these regions of high spav-2 infection could represent a stressful part of juvenile sockeye outmigration possibly resulting in higher susceptibility to infection moreover spav-2 was detected at high loads in fish sampled from regions where finfish aquaculture facilities are abundant and accordingly sea lice infestation is high price et al 2011 it remains an open question whether an alternative host could play a role in virus transmission between fish andor result in an increased susceptibility to infection valdes-donoso et al 2013 the distribution of cav was markedly different from spav cav was not detected in any juvenile wild or hatchery chinook salmon despite being detected in farmed fish on both the west and east coasts of vancouver island over 20 of moribund chinook aquaculture fish tested positive for cav with most detections occurring in fish at least 15 years after ocean entry well past the time when migratory salmon were sampled hence infection by cav may take a considerable time to develop or be an infection that is only acquired by older fish cav was also detected in a small number of farmed atlantic salmon seven positive detections of 2816 fish tested the monophyletic grouping of cav with other disease causing aquareoviruses and the consistency with haemorrhagic disease suggest that the virus is important to monitor in cultured fish and potentially wild adults returning after several years at sea psnv distribution was strongly associated with a handful of salmon-enhancement hatcheries but was also detected in 18 of aquaculture chinook and 3 of wild chinook figure 2figure supplement 1 in hatchery fish infection by psnv was primarily localised to gill tissue figure 4a reminiscent of the respiratory disease caused by the related mammalian coronaviruses such as mers and sars figure 1c psnv is of particular concern as it proliferates while fish are undergoing smoltification a process during which the gill tissue undergoes cellular reconfiguration to prepare for saltwater notably branchial proliferation of no known cause was noted in some farmed salmon infected with psnv in one of the hatcheries where pre- and post-release sampling took place the virus increased in prevalence during smolt development in fresh water was detected shortly post-release and was barely detected in the month following ocean entry figure 4b this suggests that infected fish either cleared the infection or did not survive after entry into the marine environment the second interpretation is consistent with the lower rates of ocean survival in fish produced from hatcheries versus wild salmon beamish et al 2012b viral disease is a potential threat to wild fish stocks yet little is known about viruses circulating in wild farmed or hatchery salmon here through metatranscriptomic surveys we reveal several previously unknown viruses that were discovered in dead and dying aquaculture fish and show them to also occur in wild and hatchery-reared fish depending on the viral and host species the viruses range from being localised to widespread from infecting 1 to 20 of fish and being from within the limits of detection to very high loads our results are consistent with some of these viruses being causative agents of disease making it critical to understand their possible roles in salmon mortality and the decline of wild salmon populations and their potential interactions with net-pen fish farming and hatchery rearing viral discovery in moribund individuals followed by extensive surveillance and histopathological localisation are powerful tools towards the ultimate goals of identifying causative agents of disease and understanding the impact of infectious agents in wild populations these insights are crucial as juvenile salmon that are in less than optimal health are expected to have lower rates of survival in the wild continued surveillance and knowledge of endemic and emerging virus infections in these iconic salmon species is beneficial for their conservation samples were provided by the fisheries and oceans canada aquaculture management division and salmon enhancement program additional samples were collected by the hakai institute juvenile salmon program hatchery samples are identified by fin clipping and in this study wild fish could also encompass unmarked hatchery fish dna is extracted for detection of dna viruses bacteria and parasites from the same tissues from which we extract rna to target rna viruses nucleic acid extractions on

samples homogenization using tri-reagent was performed in a mixer mill qiagen maryland on each tissue independently five tissues- gill liver heart head kidney and brain tri-reagent homogenates were organically separated using bromochloropropane with the rna-containing aqueous layer removed for rna extraction and the lower dna-containing organic layer separated from the organics using a tnes-urea

beckman-coulter mississauga on canada automated liquid-handling instrument based on manufacturers instructions mixed tissue rna 1 g was reverse transcribed into cdna using the superscript vilo master mix kit invitrogen carlsbad ca following the manufacturers instructions we applied a panel of host biomarkers genes that when co-expressed are indicative of a viral disease state vdd miller et al 2017 samples that displayed a positive viral disease state but were not positive for viruses based on our 45 microbe panel screening as described in bass et al 2019 were selected for high throughput sequencing of rna dual rna-seq to discover new viral agents total rna from the mixed tissue samples was evaluated for quality using the total rna pico chip on the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent

primers were added to the cdna during the final amplification step which involved 14 cycles the 3-terminal tagged cdna and final amplified library were purified using the agencourt ampure xp system beckman coulter brea ca the final library size was determined using the hs dna chip on the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent santa clara ca and the concentration was determined using the qubit dsdna hs

sequence spav-2 psnv and cav the samples were prepared using the same method as above but sequenced by bc cancer agency using a hiseq 2  125 protocol four different samples indexed over one lane the quality of the raw reads was checked using fastqc v0117 httpswwwbioinformaticsbabrahamacukprojectsfastqc low quality reads or regions of adapter sequences were removed using trimmomatic v036 bankevich et al 2012 reads were aligned to the atlantic salmon genome using bwa mem v0717-r1188 and unmapped reads were retained the unmapped reads were then balanced using trimmomatic and assembled into contigs using spades v391 genome assembler bankevich et al 2012 putative viral contigs were identified by aligning translated contigs using diamond v0916117 buchfink et al 2015 to the nr database reference alignments of all the reads to the viral contigs were used to ensure that no assembly artefacts occurred and the contigs were trimmed appropriately using geneious v1013 assembled sequences are available on genbank bioproject prjna547678 genbank accession numbers mk611979 - mk611996 and raw sequencing reads have been uploaded to the sequence read archive samn11974798 - samn11974801 the phylogeny of each virus was resolved based on the predicted replicase cav and spav and orf1ab psnv amino acid sequences as nucleotide sequences were too dissimilar to reliably align alignments were generated with maftt v742 katoh and standley 2013 employing the e-ins-i algorithm this alignment algorithm is suited for evolutionarily distinct sequences with conserved motifs such as viral rna polymerase that are embedded within long unalignable residues the novel salmon viruses were aligned with other viral genomes with shared amino acid similarity as detected by diamond buchfink et al 2015 in addition viral genomes which are known to be evolutionarily related to these were included the multiple protein alignments were then used as to build phylogenies using phyml 30 guindon et al 2010 plugin within geneious with 100 bootstraps to generate branch support values trees are mid-point rooted for clarity only and do not necessarily represent the ancestral relationship of the viruses assembled viral sequence contigs from the appropriate sample were imported into primer express v301 software thermo fisher scientific waltham ma where qpcr taqman assays were designed using default parameters supplementary file 1 these assays were then tested using the fluidigm biomark microfluidics-based qpcr system following the same protocol as described below except with the new viral primer pairs included in the sta step and controls from these initial screens the most consistent assay was chosen and apc standards were constructed to include in future fluidigm biomark qpcr microbe panels the assay-specific theoretical limit of detection was calculated as previously described miller et al 2016 the limit of detection was applied to categorise fish with amplifications above the 95 detection threshold that is the concentration of the analyte in the sample matrix that would be detected with high statistical certainty 95 of the time epidemiological maps were generated using these data with the limit of detection applied the maps were created within r using ggplot2 wickham 2016 and ggmap kahle and wickham 2013 for all samples after reverse transcription resultant cdna was combined with the normalised dna in a ratio of 11 and used as the template for the specific target amplification sta step the sta involves a pre-amplification of all primers to be run on a single

covid-19 pandemic usually spread at a rapid rate standard models eg the sir model 1  have stressed on the importance of finding the susceptible cases to flatten the growth rate of the spread of infection as early as possible in the present scientific world location traces in the form of gps coordinates are logged by mobile device manufacturing and their operating systems developing companies such as apple samsung google etc however due to the sensitive nature of this data it is usually not shared with other organizations mainly to protect individual privacy however in disaster situations such as epidemics data in the form of location traces of a community of people can potentially be helpful to proactively locate susceptible people from the community and enforce quarantine on them as early as possible since procuring such data for the purpose of restricted use possibly by government organizations is difficult time-consuming due to the sensitive nature of the data a strong case needs to be made that how could such data be useful in disaster situations the aim of this article is to to demonstrate a proof-of-the-concept that with the availability of massive amounts of real check-in data it is feasible to develop a scalable system that is both effective in terms of identifying the susceptible people and efficient in terms of the time taken to do so we believe that this proof-of-the-concept will encourage sharing with restricted use of such sensitive data in order to help mitigate disaster situations in this article we describe a software resource to efficiently consuming a small run-time locate a set of susceptible persons given a global database of user check-ins and a set of infected people specifically we describe a system named infectracer 1  that seeks to find out cases of close proximity of a person with another infected person since a naive approach of pairwise checking on billions of check-in records is clearly not scalable we employ an indexingbased solution similar in principle to what is used in standard web search systems first we index billions of check-in records analogous to indexing web pages second a number of records in this index is marked to be infected due to available information of reported infection third given the location trace of each infected person analogous to a keyword-based query executed on a web search system we find out a list of susceptible people analogous to the 10 blue links found by google in response to a query merging the results for each infected person in a community thus gives a list of all susceptible people for whom appropriate measures can then be undertaken as a different use-case it is also possible for an individual enduser to formulate a query comprised of a set of his personal checkin records and then find out if he had come in close contact in terms 1 httpsgithubcomgdebasisinfectracer of the space and time of his own check-ins with another infected person this individual can then impose appropriate measures on himself such as self-isolation or visiting a gp  the objective of the retrieval approach is then to find the set of ghost-users given a real user because as per the ground-truth of the simulated data these pseudo users came in close contact with a known infected user in a real life situation one has a massive database of user checkins of a population out of which it is known that a number of persons are infected the goal is to rapidly find the candidate set of people who came in close contact with the infected however a brute force search to locate the candidates would take a huge time since it is a quadratic time complexity operation in our approach we undertake an approximate nearest neighbor search approach to solve the problem the two main research questions in this setup are 1 how does efficiency run-time vary with the fraction of people infected eg if 10 of a population gets infected is this still a feasible solution 2 what is the effectiveness of the approximate nearest neighbor search since it is an approximate method it can make mistakes is there a satisfactory bound on the error rate if you want to generate your own data using a different simulation approach then read the appendix section else to conduct experiments on the provided dataset simply execute gunzip data wc -l datadatatxt wc -l datadatatxtext you should see the following output 266909 datadatatxt 1601454 datadatatxtext the indexing step enables a very fast retrieval of susceptible cases to perform the indexing step you then need to execute python indexcheckinspy -d datadatatxtext -i simusersidx where you specify the data file comprising the user-id locations time-offsets and the index file to save the data the next step is to retrieve the susceptible cases the program simulates the case that a fraction of the population whose data exists in the index already has been infected the retrieval program formulates and executes a query for each of these infected people and reports a list of 3 most susceptible persons that came in close contact in terms of space and time with an infected person you simply need to execute python retrievesusceptiblespy -d datadatatxtext -i simusersidx -s 001 -n 266909 where you specify the data file to simulate infected people the index file to retrieve susceptible people and the fraction infected in the example set to 001 or 1 the last argument is the number of real users in the data this is useful for the program to compute the ground-truth information and compute recall the program prints out output in the following format the search time is reported in seconds reading data file people in real quick time exact brute force distance computation involves scanning through billions of check-in locations for each infected person a new query which is not scalable pandemics can be better fought if susceptible people to catch an infection are quickly identified and quarantined we believe that this tool can contribute to such a cause we also observe that the recall achieved is satisfactory to reproduce the simulation results with the code provided in the repository download the foursquare 2 global check-in data in the project folder after the files are downloaded execute the script prepdatash to create the data file named datatxt by following command sh prepdatash the real foursquare check-in data is not directly applicable for our study because it is much less likely that two foursquare users would check-in to the same location a point-of-interest eg a museumrestaurant at near about the same time however to model an infectious disease spread we need to have users that came in close contact with each other in terms of both space and time we undertake a simple simulation model to generate pseudo-user interactions likely contacts first we filter the datatxt file to retain only one check-in per user this makes the simulation algorithm easier to manage next for each user u having a unique id we generate a set of mutually exclusive pseudo-users or ghost-users which comprises the ground-truth information for each user note that since all the originalreal user check-ins were sufficiently apart in space-time coordinates it is likely that the neighbourhood of a user comprised of the ghost-user check-ins are also far apart in which case one can rely with sufficient confidence on the simulated ground-truth data for each user u we generate pn number of ghost-user in  neighbourhood out of them p number of ghostusers are belong to  neighbourhood if user u is positively infected person then these p ghost-users will be considered as vulnerable person whom we need to identify and remaining n people will be considered as non-suspicious persons as they are in safe distance from the infected person u in figure 2 we presented a visualization of simulated ghost-users corresponding to a real infected user red person in the figure  to generate the simulated data simply execute sh adduserssh datatxt to address the correctness of our algorithm we employ recall as evaluation metric because the task of finding susceptible users is a recall-oriented task false positives are acceptable but not the false negatives while the parameter  controls the number of people to whom the disease spreads from a single person the parameter  controls the number of false positives intentionally introduced to see if the algorithm can filter out the true positives from the false ones in table 1  we present some results for our initial sets of experiments table 1  some preliminary results with variations in the number of infected persons total number of persons in the dataset being 266909 the number of pseudo-susceptible users the ground-truth was set to 5 in the simulations   a taxonomic study of the genus pasteurella using a numerical technique bu siitj-r j e e thal  th e genus past eur ella  a t

straightforward from available data transition matrix models tmm have been widely used in financial industry mainly in credit analysis especially in predicting credit rating migration of corporate bonds or delinquency migration of consumer loans the event chain of a consumer loans early delinquency serious delinquency default is very like the event chain of covid-19s mild case severe case critical case death using such data from chinas hubei province for which wuhan is the provincial capital city and which accounted for approximately 82 of the total reported covid-19 cases in the entire country the model is shown to be flexible robust and accurate as a result it has been adopted by the first shanghai assistance medical team in wuhans jinyintan hospital which was the first designated hospital to take covid-19 patients in the world the forecast has been used for preparing medical staff intensive care unit icu beds ventilators and other critical care medical resources and for supporting real-time medical management decisions empirical data from chinas first two months januaryfebruary of fighting covid-19 was collected and used to enhance the model by embedding npi efficiency into the model we applied the model to forecast italy south korea and iran on march 9 later we made forecasts for spain germany france us on march 24 again the model has performed very well proven to be flexible robust and accurate for most of these countriesregions outside china compared to widely used sir-type models we find tmm more flexible robust and accurate for covid-19 forecasts more importantly it has been adopted by frontline medical professionals to support real-time covid-19 medical management decisions and proven to be a more pragmatic forecasting tool three out of the four authors were invited to provide insights on this novel model at the brookings event fighting covid-19 experiences and lessons from the frontlines in asia 3  which was broadcasted international news agencies including caixin global 4  china daily 5  reuters etc the model has also received wide attention in news media including caixin with a full feature article on its forecasts 6  we suggest that modeling teams around the world should take a closer look at this discrete-time markov chain model and examine its usefulness in the battle against covid-19 including the support for real-time decision making of preparing medical staff equipment and other medical resources as well as governmentbusiness planning of when and how to imposelift non-pharmaceutical intervention npi policies  1 dr zhang is the head of the center for infectious disease at huashan hospital of fudan university and serves as the leader of shanghai anti-covid-19 clinical expert team 2 dr zheng is the vice president of first people hospital which is affiliated with shanghai jiaotong university as the leader of the first shanghai medical assistance team to wuhan after the coronavirus outbreak beginning in january he and his team worked on the frontlines battling the pandemic for 67 days and nights novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by zoonotic 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 broke out in wuhan china during december 2019 and was declared a pandemic by who on march 11 2020 as of june 30 2020 more than 10 million laboratory-confirmed cases and 500000 deaths have been documented worldwide among the tools used in the fight to contain such pandemics forecast models are critical in helping support not only medical resource management decisions but also in informing government policies such as when and where lock-down and stay-at-home directives should be enacted and lifted traditional epidemiology models use deterministic differential equations to forecast the population dynamics among various states eg susceptible exposed infectious or recovered in the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir model recently used to model the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan wu leung and leung 2020  such models have also been expanded to include additional states for covid-19 eg giordano et al 2020  these models are by design aggregate models that track 3

httpinternationalcaixincom2020-03-14101528645html only the mean populations and do not incorporate stochastic effects directly and are highly sensitive to estimated parameters for example a key parameter is the basic reproductive number r0 or the rate average number at which one currently infected person infects new persons thus an r0  1 indicates that the epidemic is dying out an inaccurate estimate of r0 is magnified in poor forecasts leading to orders of magnitude differences in output more recently epidemiologists have been looking at agent-based models very familiar to the operations research or community where individuals can be modeled in detail eg age gender health condition and stochastic characteristics are directly incorporated such models can be very useful for studying smaller communities but since they typically require stochastic monte carlo simulation may face computational challenges in scaling up to large cities or countries when the number of agents becomes large also if the amount of detailed individual data available is limited then it would be challenging to estimate the model with any degree of confidence we propose a discrete-time markov chain dtmc model where the states of the chain are similar to the states in the compartmental models since this dtmc modeling approach is analogous to a financial forecasting model called the transition matrix model tmm widely used in credit analysis eg malik and thomas 2012 chen et al 2018  be it corporate rating migration or individual consumer behavior we will also refer to it as the tmm approach for example most major rating agencies such as morningstar 7  moodys investor services 8  sp global rating 9  all publish their annual transition matrices for corporate rating migration so corporate bond investors can estimate the likelihood of their investments getting downgraded in the future transition matrices can also be stochastic where the transition probabilities are dependent on both the individual characteristics and other external variables for example ife group 2012-2015 10  performed actuarial studies for the worlds largest monoline insurance program federal housing administration fhas mutual mortgage insurance mmi fund with approximately 27 trillion in assets under management they provided forecasts for the funds performance for as long as 37 years into the future and tens of millions of mortgages are simulated for hundreds of paths to calculate the future expected credit losses and loss distribution the calculation process is very time consuming and can take as long as three hours even after simulation optimization transition matrices can also be hybrid partially deterministic partially stochastic where some probabilities are constant and some are time varying transition matrix models share similarities with the above-mentioned agent-based model used in epidemiology study our proposed approach has the following advantages it incorporates stochastic features directly while retaining essentially the same states compartments as in the compartmental models its discrete-time nature and degree of modeling detail make it straightforward to estimate model parameters from available data it is computationally tractable both in terms of parameter estimation and in terms of model output analysis the tmm approach has been shown to be flexible robust and accurate from field experience the tmm forecast results have been used to support real-time medical management decisions allocate medical staff and plan for business re-opening here are some examples of the tmm forecasts used to support decision making in the fight against covid-19  on february 10 th  the tmm forecast was adopted by the first shanghai medical assistance team led by dr zheng one of this papers authors in wuhans jinyintan hospital the first designated hospital to take covid-19 patients in the world the forecast has been used in preparing medical staff icu beds ventilators and other critical care medical resources by central and provincial health commissions and local cdcs  on february 14 th  we published an article 11  indicating that under the cautiously optimal scenario medical staff needed for taking care of severe and critical patients could reach 40000-45000 soon after this forecast more medical assistance teams were dispatched from all over china to wuhan and other cities in hubei province the total number of medical assistance teams reached 346 with more than 42600 medical staff on march 8 12   we also published our forecast for italy south korea and iran 13 on march 9 th  and channeled the italy forecast to one italian cabinet member on the same day indicating a very dire situation with a forecast of more than 190000 cases likely to occur by april end the italian government implemented a national lockdown policy on the next day  on february 15th we forecasted the back-to-normal date for hubei province was most likely to be mid-april 413-420 14  on april 8 th  the lock-down in wuhan was lifted and dr zheng was able to come back to shanghai after fighting covid-19 for 67 days in the epicenter of wuhan this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly discuss sir-type models and discuss their major drawbacks in section 3 we present the transition matrix model for covid-19 forecast and draw the analogy to transition matrix models used in the mortgage finance industry in section 4 we discuss model robustness accuracy and flexibility of tmm compared with sir-type models in section 5 we discuss the effects of medical assistance teams dispatched from all over china to wuhan and other cities in hubei province which effectively increased the cure rate and reduced the fatality rate which is the major reason for the forecast errors for the cure and death tolls prevailing epidemiological forecast models relevant to covid-19 are based on extensions of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir model which are deterministic continuous-time dynamic models that model the evolution of the aggregate population under consideration where the population is separated into a fixed number of mutually exclusive compartments for example in the original susceptible-infectious-recovered sir model of kermack and mckendrick 1927  the compartments are defined as follows  susceptible s -not infected yet  infected i -assumed infectious with symptoms  removed r -recovered sometimes this is the definition or deceased the three compartments are represented by time-varying functions st it rt representing the average number in each compartment state the simplest set of ordinary differential equations odes modeling the dynamics is the following which has just three parameters a0 r00 and the population nthis system can be solved analytically but once any realistic features are incorporated into the model which is the case for real-world applications numerical simulation is required eg the seir model of wu leung and leung 2020 used for covid-19 generally compartmental models can be very effective epidemiology tools once a disease is well understood and in a mature phase they are also good theoretical models for reference purposes eg for comparing the infection rate of covid-19 against other respiratory infectious diseases such as sars and mers by comparing the different values of r0 once accurate estimates of model parameters can be obtained however for forecasting purposes based on relatively sparse data especially with regards to patient-level outcomes as opposed to aggregate cases they may exhibit high sensitivity to the estimated model parameters such as r0 limiting their robustness in forecasting in the early and middle stages of epidemics in the seir model of wu leung and leung 2020  r0 is estimated using markov chain monte carlo methods with gibbs sampling and non-informative flat prior so as we will shortly see it is a more involved process than the parameter estimation process for our proposed approach which relies directly on available empirical data there are several serious drawbacks to sir-type models the first drawback is its high sensitivity to model parameters which poses serious challenges in terms of model robustness a basic model driver in compartmental models sir seir and their extensions is the parameter r0 which indicates how contagious an infectious disease is and is also referred to as the reproduction number because it represents the average number of people who will contract the disease from one person with that disease compartmental models are very sensitive to their model parameters as well as initial conditions so accurate estimates are crucial if these models are to be used for forecasting which is not necessarily the primary usage for these types of models especially in the early stages of a new outbreak a wide range of r0 values were reported by different researchers ranging from 20 to 57 as listed in table 1 below given this level of difference the forecasted number of infection cases will differ by 200 in one week 800 in two weeks and 8000 in one-months time if after 5 million infection cases and more than 330000 deaths may 21 data scientists still cannot agree on the very fundamental parameter that probably suggests there is no magic r0 that is universally applicable and forecasts based on estimated r0 will be highly unstable table 1 summarizes the forecast numbers of cumulative cases for the r0 estimates assuming incubation period of 52 days as estimated in li et al 2020  assuming the initial condition is 100 infection cases within three weeks forecasts vary from as low as 224 to as high as 35 million even for the same paper the forecast numbers can vary widely and the max to min forecast ratio ranges from 53 to 720 this table clearly illustrates high parameter sensitivity exhibited by sir-type models in one sir-extended model giordano blanchini bruno et al 2020  the forecasts for italys covid-19 outcome are 40 025 and 009 of total population infected thus the maxmin ratio is close to 444 times which basically make the forecast impractical for medical resource planning secondly sir-type models cannot easily incorporate npi measures they generally assume that reduction of transportation and social interaction will reduce the coronavirus transmission gradually which is reflected in the reduction of inflow and outflow of passengers and transmissibility parameters such as r0 however drastic npi measures taken by governments such as lock-down of city blocks communities and mass quarantine of close contacts not only affect the inflow and outflow of people but also reduce the infection period as close contacts are quickly tracked and quarantined these features are not well captured by such models as a result some models over-forecast the infection cases by a large factor eg wu et al 2020a estimated there would be 800000 covid-19 cases in shanghai by the end of february but due to massive testing and contact tracing efforts of more than 700 public health officials and 300000 volunteers all the close contacts of imported infection cases were quickly identified and quarantined as a result there was not a single case of community transmission and only 337 cases were reported by february end for a metropolis of approximately 30 million people in summary from a practical perspective if the goal of the forecasting model is to provide support for decisions such as medical resource planning including staff doctors nurses cleaning staff etc supplies icu beds ventilators n95 masks etc and biohazardous waste disposal capacity alternative modeling approaches may be more aligned with the available data for estimating model parameters furthermore adding new compartments in sirseir models to allow differentiation between severe cases requiring hospital beds and critical cases requiring icu beds and ventilators results in additional model complexity and the introduction of even more parameters that are difficult to estimate from the available data we model the patient treatment process as an absorbing markov chain with the following discrete states analogous to compartments in the sirseir traditional differential equation-based models under medical observation discharged infected non-severe infected severe critical death and cured the potential transitions between the states are shown in figure 1  where self-loops are understood but omitted in the diagram for clarity and the three states outside the treatment boxed labelled discharged cured and dead are absorbing states note that infected represented as a decision diamond is not a separate state by itself in the dtmc model as once a close contact is a confirmed case of infection it is immediately classified as severe or non-severe another state called infected asymptomatic could also be easily added to the model but since there is sparse data to estimate this state 15  we have not included it and those patients would not have entered the medical observation state in the current version of the model one of the main differences between the compartment models and the proposed modified dtmc model is that the former relies on parameters that have interpretative meanings so specific data are required to estimate them whereas the parameters of the proposed model depend only on transition probabilities between states defined based on medical classifications where available data can be used to estimate them directly as an example in the seir model of wu leung and leung 2020  there are two parameters corresponding to the mean latent and infectious periods which are challenging to estimate accurately from early data note that the states cured and discharged could also have been put together into a single state eg called healthy but for purposes of parameter estimation and tracking statistics the cure rate is of separate interest the three states discharged deceased and cured are absorbing states whereas the others are all transient states assuming non-zero probabilities for existing transitions in the diagram this is very similar to the transition matrix model tmm widely used in mortgage finance industry in the following chart we can see a normal current mortgage can go to early delinquency for missing 1-2 payments if the borrower can make up the payments then she can return to the normal state if she keeps missing payments her mortgage will be moved to the serious delinquency sdq department for special treatment sometimes even the mortgage servicing will be transferred to a special servicer who is more sophisticated with sdq loan servicing one option is to go through a loan modification via different payment reduction schemes ie term extension rate reduction principal forgiveness andor forbearance if a borrower can successfully go through loan modification she may return to the normal state if a modification is not working out the loan may go to default the structures of figures 1 and 2 share many similarities which convinced us to try a tmm approach to predict the covid-19 progression the transition probabilities of the dtmc model can be either determined by regression or simply derived from empirical probabilities table 2 compares sir-type models and the proposed tmm approach the first application of tmm was to predict the covid-19 progression in chinas hubei province for which wuhan is the provincial capital city and which accounted for approximately 82 of the total reported covid-19 cases in the entire country we adopted the empirical approach when estimating the model in our application to predicting the covid-19 spread in hubei province china specifically we defined the states of the model as follows l under medical observation umo state of a close contact of a potential infection case who is traced identified and put into medical observation generally in a quarantine facility from this state the next day a patient may be confirmed with infection discharged without infection or remain umo eg if the test results have not come back yet l discharged dis terminal state for a close contact after undergoing medical observation although one could possibly reenter as a close contact in the generation phase l infected but non-severe ins state for a patient with mild symptoms generally treated in makeshift shelter hospitals for hubei covid-19 patients there are three possible states for the next day cured worsened condition to severe or remaining non-severe l infected and severe ias state for a patient who develops severe symptoms that require hospitalization and oxygen support who 2020 there are again three possible states for the next day worsening to critical improvement to non-severe or staying the same l infected and critical iac state for a patient showing critical symptoms and requiring admission to an icu who 2020 there are also three possible states for the next day death improvement to severe staying the same l cured cu and deceased de are two terminal states for severe and critical cases covid-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sepsis and septic shock multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury treatment for these patients is very complicated and requires extremely skilled specialists for example one of this papers authors dr zheng led the first shanghai medical assistance team to wuhan with 150 medical specialists they worked at the icu in the worlds first designated covid-19 hospital jinyintan hospital for 67 days treating 170 severe and critical patients with a cure rate of more than 80 among these patients 123 were critical cases with a cure rate of 7235 note that infected itself is not an independent state since the outcome is revealed instantaneously in addition to these states there are a few other covid-19 numbers worth mentioning and we also provide forecasts for these numbers l daily new confirmed cases dncc l cumulative confirmed cases ccc l daily active cases or infected and under treatment iat thus each day a patients state on day n is characterized by a state vector defined as follows  where the value of each element can be viewed as the probability of being in that state so for each individual new close contact generated the elements would sum to 1 for a given individual in a known state the corresponding element would be equal to 1 and the other elements would be zero for example a patient currently in state infected and non-severe ins would have state vector 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 and the next day the state vector could remain the same or transition to either 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 severe or 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 cured thus for the entire potentially exposed population the state vector is defined as the count of people in each state for example at an early stage with say 100 patients being tested or treated out of which 30 are awaiting testing results 10 are critical 10 are severe and 50 are non-severe the state vector would be as follows if the population is limited and the transition matrix is stationary the above formula will be sufficient in predicting all future outcomes and of course since it is an absorbing chain all the transient states would eventually go to zero and individuals already in the pool will eventually end up discharged cured or deceased the absorbing states in epidemic settings such as the covid-19 situation in early 2020 the population is not fixed and additional individuals enter into the population via the generation of new close contacts in figure 1  every day new close contacts are added to the medical observation pool in our modified dtmc model these new individuals are generated as a proportion of the current new close contacts ie via where the ncc change rate parameter is analogous to the basic reproductive number r0 parameter in sir-type models in that when it is positive the number of infected individuals in the population is increasing corresponding to an r0 value greater than 1 just as when intervention measures cause r0 to eventually decrease below 1 correspondingly the ncc change rate will become negative the ncc change rate is a critical parameter in our forecast but it is readily estimated from available data because it appears in a single equation whereas r0 appears simultaneously in two or more equations in sir and seir models eg the very simplest sir model in section 2 and the seir model of wu leung and leung 2020  this dtmc state transition matrix model can be used for forecasts such as when the infection peak time maximum number of active infection cases occurs as well as patient distributions critical severe non-severe which can be used for supporting medical resource allocation planning although there are three hospitalization states -non-severe cases ins severe cases ias and critical cases iac for the covid-19 hubei province data we had only the patient count in each state but not the actual pairwise transitions among these three states so we combined the entire hospitalization period into a therapeutic state infected and being treated iat -also known as the daily active cases which minimizes the need for estimation for those unobserved transitions instead we used the proportion of patients of each state ins ias iac within iat to forecast the number of non-severe severe critical patients in addition the model also tracks daily new confirmed cases dncc and cumulative confirmed cases ccc since these metrics are tracked in actual data from all these various data the parameters of the model can be estimated directly as follows  new close contacts ncc change rate  ancc  lnncctncct-1  umo daily discharge rate pumodis  distumot-1  pr umo  iat pumoiat  iattumot-1  pr iat  deceased piatde  det  iatt-1  pr iat cured piatcu  cut  iatt-1 and as alluded to above estimating the count of active severe cases and critical cases requires two additional parameters  proportion of severe patients s  iast iatt  proportion of critical patients c  iact iatt we collected all data from caixin data a subsidiary of caixin group who retrieves the original data from china national health commission we also collected supplementary data from hubei health commission mainly for ias iac count the data period starts from 20191231 and ends on 202028 updated on a daily basis next we describe how we choose parameters based on these observed empirical probabilities the following empirical transition probabilities were observed on 202028 as mentioned in the previous section when describing the dtmc model the ncc change rate ancc is closely linked to r0 but can be directly estimated from empirical data this parameter has very strong policy implications as it measures the effectiveness and efficiency of non-pharmaceutical intervention npi policies and actions a positive value indicates that the npi measures are failing as new close contacts are increasing whereas a negative value indicates that the npi measures are effective as fewer people are contracting the coronavirus on a daily basis the higher the absolute value of the parameter the more effective the npi measures are since the 8-day empirical average of -6 is volatile we considered three values for the model -1 -5 -10 we could not obtain the one-day probability of umo discharge rate in hubei province so we used the national rates since the one-day probability was 17 and the 10-day moving weighted average was 13 we tested the model with both 17 and 13 in hubei province on 28 the one-day probability of transition from medical observation to confirmed infection was 215 with a 10-day weighted average of 394 so we used 4 as our model parameter the latest single-day fatality rate was 035 and the 10-day moving weighted average was 063 as this probability was declining we used the latest value 035 as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic the latest one-day cure rate was 140 with a 10-day moving weighted average of 091 as this probability was increasing we used the latest value 140 as our model parameter from the historical data the proportion of critical cases is relatively stable whereas the proportion of severe cases fluctuated more neither of these showed monotone behavior so we used the average 1450 and 450 of the latest value and 10-day moving weighted average as our model parameters to put more weight on recent observations in addition to the parameter values just described we considered six different scenarios to control for forecast uncertainty based on three different values of the ncc change rate ancc -10 optimistic -5 cautiously optimistic and -1 relatively pessimistic and two different values of the umo discharge rate pumodis 17 and 105 where 17 is more optimistic in wu zheng and chen 2020  ncc change rate was assumed constant whereas in follow-up work  it was allowed to be time-varying to capture changes due to npi implementations table 4 summarizes the scenarios and parameter values used in our model  in this section we discuss the model accuracy via back-testing in section 41 then we discuss model robustness with respect to parameter sensitivity in section 42 afterwards we discuss model robustness with respect to an external shock event in section 43 lastly we discuss model flexibility in terms of adjusting to preventive policy effectiveness in section 44 after february we performed back-testing for the forecast with the actual numbers key performance metrics such as peak value of critical cases active cases month end total cases were very close to model forecast under the cautiously optimistic scenario which was picked by us as the most likely scenario the relative errors of peak active cases peak severe cases peak critical cases and february-end total cases were 10 201 75 13 relative to the median of the two cautiously optimistic scenarios regarding forecast accuracy sir-type models generally do not perform very well as mentioned earlier giordano blanchini bruno et al 2020 gave three forecast scenarios for italys covid-19 total infection case estimates while the medium case of 025 of total population infected is the closest to the actual observation the actual infection case on 430 was 034 of total population infected so the closest forecast was off by about 36 at the end of april in zheng wu yao et al 2020  the tmm forecast for italys total infected cases on 430 was 192593 while the actual was 203591 with an 6 error regarding the peak of daily new cases the tmm forecast was 6681 on 323 while the actual peak occurred on 322 with 6557 cases or a 2 error the forecast and back-testing are provided in appendix i we performed similar parameter sensitivity practice for the tmm used for the hubei forecast in wu et al 2020b  two major parameters are the ncc change rate and medical release rate where ncc change rate takes values of -10 -5 and -1 and medical release rate takes values of -17 and -105 as can be seen from the following table while the major parameter nccchangerate changes from -10 to -1 a ten-fold difference and the umo discharge rate change from 17 to 105 the maxmin ratio is merely 15 this suggests the tmm approach is more robust than sir-type models  next we take a more detailed look by considering the daily dynamics through the end of february on february 12 th  three days after we published our forecast  the hubei province health commission changed the diagnosis criteria and allowed those patients who do not have definitive pcr test results but have clinical symptoms mainly ct scan results to be counted as confirmed covid-19 cases this changed criterion increased the daily incremental cases by more than 14000 resulting in the spike shown in figure 3  the spike led us to consider a drastic revision of our models future forecasts to adjust for the changed criterion however after carefully examining the implication of the new criteria we decided not to change our forecast as we concluded the change would not have too much impact on the forecast results for cumulative cases in the long term because it just confirmed suspected cases earlier most of which would eventually turn into confirmed cases as long as our forecasts for new close contacts are not heavily affected the model should be robust to handle this surge in incremental covid-19 cases indeed figure 4 confirms that the incremental close contacts did not change dramatically as a result of the spike in new confirmed cases as a result the cumulative cases are back in the range of the two s2 scenarios by the end of february as shown in figure 5  also the critical case numbers are not heavily impacted by the spike as there is an intermediate state of severe cases between critical cases and new cases thus the spike in new cases is not immediately reflected in the critical case numbers so figure 6 shows the model forecasts up to february 22 are good after which the results of the arrival of medical assistance teams led to a dramatic decrease on the other hand the severe cases forecasts are clearly impacted by the surge since there is no middle state between the severe state and new cases and that resulted in moderate underprediction for the much of the month as shown in figure 7  the arrival of armies of medical assistance teams throughout the hubei province in february clearly had a beneficial effect on reducing mortality rates and conversely increasing cure rates in hubei province shown in figures 8 and 9  respectively where the model forecasts gradually and consistently diverge for both of these cumulative counts cured and deceased throughout the month this is discussed further in the next section as a result the numbers of cumulative cases are back in the range of s2 scenarios at the end of february also the number of critical cases is not heavily impacted by the surge as there is an intermediate state of severe cases between critical cases and new cases so the surge in new cases is not immediately reflected in the number of critical cases and our model performed very well before february 22 as seen in figure 6  the severe cases forecast is impacted by the surge since there is no middle state between the severe state and new case and that resulted in moderate underprediction for the about 10 days as seen in figure 7  the death toll forecast was also close to actual until late february as indicated in figure 8  the improvement in february was mainly driven by the efforts of medical assistance teams dispatched from other provinces to hubei and will be described in more detail in section 5 the cure forecast probably has the biggest forecast error seen in figure 9  this is also due to dramatic improvements in medical resources and care closely related to the previous explanation for the decrease in death rate so this will also be described in section 5  as illustrated earlier the tmm approach can forecast all states in the covid-19 pandemic including the intermediate states medical observation mild cases severe cases critical cases and the terminal states discharge from medical observation cure death the model does not include asymptomatic cases the inclusion of asymptomatic cases can be readily handled by adding one more intermediate state although good data are not available for the asymptomatic population also the major purpose of the model is to predict the active cases ie patients who are receiving treatment in medical facilities and the patient distribution of severecritical cases to better manage medical resources thus adding an additional asymptomatic state not only unnecessarily complicates the model but also compromises its robustness in another paper  we drew from experience in hubei and other provinces of china during the early stages of the covid-19 outbreak and improved our model to incorporate different levels of preventive policy effectiveness and made forecasts for italy south korea iran later we applied the model to forecast the covid-19 progression in other countries including spain france germany and united states most of these models performed reasonably well and the forecasts are included in appendices i  ii we also estimate the preventive policy effectiveness parameter in appendix iii in the very early stages of the covid-19 outbreak the daily fatality rate of severe including critical cases was extremely high around 8 on chinese new years eve january 24 th  the first medical assistance team was dispatched from shanghai to wuhan to help the local medical staff on february 10 th  the tmm forecast was adopted by the first shanghai medical assistance team led by dr zheng one of this papers authors in wuhans jinyintan hospital the first designated hospital to take covid-19 patients in the world the forecast has been used in preparing medical staff icu beds ventilators and other critical care medical resources by central and provincial health commissions and local centers of disease control for example on february 14 th  we published an article 16 indicating that under the cautiously optimal scenario medical staff needed for taking care of severe and critical patients could reach 40000-45000 soon after this forecast more medical assistance teams were dispatched from all over china to wuhan and other hubei province cities reaching more than 42000 medical staff by the beginning of march on february 15th we forecasted the back-to-normal date most likely to be mid-april 17  but due to the extraordinary efforts of these medical assistance teams the lock-down in wuhan was lifted on april 8th and dr zheng was able to return to shanghai after fighting covid-19 for 67 days in the epicenter of wuhan during januaryfebruary 2020 two hospitals with 1900 beds were built within two weeks to accept severe and critical patients as time went on medical staff became more experienced treating covid-19 all these measures helped to reduce the daily severe case fatality rate to a very low level of 05 an almost 94 drop from the very early stages illustrated in figure 10  the model forecasts in figure 8 use the higher fatality rate observed on 28 resulting in higher death toll forecasts moreover starting from 25 16 fangcang shelter hospitals were put into use accepting more than 12000 non-severe patients in wuhan these shelter hospitals were converted from stadiums shopping malls convention centers etc this measure moved the treatment window earlier and placed patients with mild symptoms in these makeshift hospitals to receive proper medical treatment rather than self-quarantining at home where there would be significantly heightened risk of family transmission and community transmission the daily cure rate of non-severe cases increased dramatically from the level of 1 in late january to close to 10 in late february illustrated in figure 11  the model forecasts in figure 9 use the much lower cure rate observed on 28 resulting in the significantly lower cure forecasts finally as a result of all these timely measures the peak of actual active cases was moved earlier to february 16 instead of the date originally estimated as between 31-37 as illustrated in figure 12   we introduced a new discrete-time markov chain dtmc transition matrix model tmm for modeling epidemic outbreaks that directly incorporates stochastic behavior parameter estimation for the model is straightforward so we applied the model using covid-19 data from hubei province for which it provided reasonably accurate forecasts with sensitivity analysis illustrating its robustness properties in terms of far less sensitivity to parameter misspecification than traditional epidemiological compartmental models as a result the model has been adopted by the first shanghai assistance medical team in wuhans jinyintan hospital the first designated hospital to take covid-19 patients in the world and the forecasts have been used for preparing and allocating medical staff icu beds ventilators and other critical care medical resources and for supporting medical management decisions the proposed approach can forecast all the states in the covid-19 pandemic including the intermediate states medical observation mild cases severe cases critical cases and the terminal states discharged from medical observation cured deceased as mentioned earlier in the model formulation the model applied here to covid-19 does not include asymptomatic cases which can be readily handled by adding one more intermediate state but was purposely excluded since the data for the asymptomatic population is not available also the major purpose of the model is to predict active cases ie patients who are receiving treatment in medical facilities and the patient distribution of severecritical cases to better manage medical resources similar to the finance academic community where the literature on asset pricing is dominated by stochastic partial differential equation models for which stylized models are used to generated closed-form solution and big-picture insights the prevalent modeling paradigm in the academic epidemiological research literature also values stylized models in this case based on systems of deterministic ordinary differential equations the first author has spent over two decades in the finance industry and implemented many models for investment decisions and believes that the model proposed here follows the same vein of industry relying on more practically implementable models the proposed approach is a preliminary attempt to advocate models that are tailored to the available data and anticipated usage of the model in decision making whether it be strategic policy supply chain planning or hospital operations thus the focus is on flexibility ease of implementation and robustness rather than theoretical elegance in terms of ongoing work zheng et al 2020 draws upon the experience from hubei and other provinces in china during the early stages of the covid-19 outbreak to improve the tmm model by incorporating different levels of preventive policy efficiency this led to forecasts for italy south korea and iran which were posted online 18 on march 9 the forecasts for italy were channeled to an italian cabinet member on the same day indicating a very dire situation with forecast of more than 190000 likely cases by april end with weak intervention efforts the italian government implemented a national lock-down policy on the next day the best covid-19 forecast model probably does not exist but some models are more useful than others depending on the types of decision being supported traditional epidemiology models like the sir-type models rely heavily on estimated parameters such as r0 and could have very wide forecast ranges over a relatively short period due to high sensitivity and wide confidence intervals of key parameters they are useful for reference purposes but may have limited ability in supporting real-time decision making tmm models are mainly driven by empirical probabilities and do not require complicated estimation procedures in our case study they are shown to be more robust flexible and accurate once the clinical experts are involved in the modeling process they know more about fighting covid-19 in the frontline their experience is of immeasurable value not only in saving lives directly but also for building models that can help save lives through efficient allocation of medical resources in the eyes of a hammer everything is a nail but its not true so dont go with the standard models in the academic literature if they dont fit the use fit your best model to the data not the other way around  high speed rail effects on tourism spanish empirical evidence derived from chinas modelling experience juan campa luis mara lpez-lambas eugenia begoa guirao   due to the recent climate of financial instability the discussion of evaluation methodologies for high-speed rail hsr projects is now a key issue for transport planners both in countries without hsr and in those with long experience in hsr operation the transport project evaluation methodologies and public sector investment assessment in the literature review follow two main frameworks broad cba cost benefit analysis and multi-criteria analysis mca both methodologies must consider all the economic activities that are reinforced by hsr among other variables cba methodologies are most frequently used in the literature for estimating hsr profitability coto-millan et al 2007 de rus and nombela 2007 betancor and llobet 2015 although in the last ten years mca has become more widespread as a method for evaluating transport projects and offers the possibility of including indirect and long-term hsr impacts guirao and campa 2015 macharis and bernardin 2015 reported that after a more general category passenger transport such as hsr rail and notably mobility management are the public administrations most common types of transport project decisions handled by mca within the cba methodologies de rus and nombela 2007 were the first to calculate the required minimum level of demand at which investment in hsr could be considered profitable from a social perspective they used real costs of construction maintenance and rolling stock for european hsr lines currently in operation in addition to potential time savings standard time values and predicted growth in demand although this approach has been generally accepted by the scientific community the wider economic benefits of high speed are clearly hard to gauge as they are swamped by many  not inconsiderable  external factors such as territorial impacts territorial impacts may lead directly to social and economic benefits and despite the problems of estimating and analysis some attempts have been made to study them especially in the case of spain gutierrez 2001 urea et al 2009 ortega et al 2012 in this context the tourism impact of hsr implementation has recently emerged as an important issue in the scientific literature as it represents a possible benefit variable to support new investment in hsr lines however tourism is a complex phenomenon sinclair and stabler 1997 caccomo and solonandrasana 2001 as it is a form of complementary demand for which the main components are transport food and accommodation morley 1992 making it very difficult to separate the effects of transport on tourism from other territorial effects the literature review described in section 2 shows how tourism has affected hsr demand little research has been done so far even in europe to estimate empirically the opposite effect how tourism indicators are affected by new hsr lines many authors agree that the expansion of hsr networks and services brings new opportunities to cities metropolitan areas coastal and mountain regions and other types of tourist destinations in europe it also reinforces the expectations of local tourism stakeholders by improving the attractiveness of places for visitors although no systematic patterns have been observed most of the published studies describe specific hsr experiences case studies and some observed hsr effects on tourism but do not lead to a general conclusion china is one of the scenarios that has focused the highest number of methodologies to assess the impact of hsr on tourism wang et al 2012 chen and haynes 2012 chen and haynes 2015 today china has the worlds longest hsr network with over 19000 km of track in service in january 2016 more than the rest of the worlds high-speed rail tracks combined when the chinese government began construction of hsr in 2004 the main objective was to promote economic growth through four northsouth and four westeast hsr trunk lines since the completion of a few sectional mainline projects the impact of hsr on tourism demand has increasingly come under the spotlight given its political significance for regional economic growth using a multivariate panel analysis chen and haynes were the first to investigate the impact of a high-speed rail system on the tourism industry selecting only the numbers of incoming foreign tourists and tourism revenue as the dependent variables the results of this research confirmed that the fledgling high-speed rail services significantly boosted tourism in china between 1999 and 2010 and that provinces with high-speed rail services were likely to have approximately 20 more foreign arrivals and 25 higher tourism revenues than provinces without these systems concurrently with chen and hayness first empirical works on hsr impacts on chinas tourism industry the research of wang et al 2012 demonstrated that the chinese hsr system affected tourism demand by redistributing tourism centres and transforming the tourist market however this research methodology was not empirical so did not contribute to understanding the impact of hsr on tourism chen and haynes were thus the first to address this issue in the literature the most logical first step in the search for a new and systematic tool to evaluate the integral impact of hsr on the tourism industry would therefore appear to be to establish the suitability of applying the chinese experience to other european case studies spain with over 20 years of hsr experience and operating the longest hsr network in europe3100 km is a good scenario for the analysis and application of this panel data model as tourism is one of the countrys key industries accounting for 109 of its gross domestic product gdp for the year 2014 ine 2016a this paper contributes to the limited existing literature by analysing the empirical impact of a hsr network on tourism indicators the added value of this research lies in the fact that it is the first assessment of the multivariate panel data model tested in the chinese scenario when applied to a european country spain the paper is divided into the following sections section 2 contains a review of the literature on tourism and hsr section 3 gives an explanatory description of the tourism sector in china and spain section 4 includes the model equations the application to the spanish case and a discussion of the results obtained compared to china section 5 presents a study of the city of toledo spain at the local level to analyse in greater detail the circular and cumulative causation between hsr and the evolution of tourism indicators finally the main conclusions are summarised in section 6 the link between tourism and transportation infrastructure has been widely analysed in the literature chew 1987 martin and witt 1988 abeyratne 1993 khadaroo and seetanah 2007 khadaroo and seetanah 2008 there is a general consensus that an increase in accessibility to the tourism destination usually leads to an increase in tourism demand della corte et al 2013 and is a critical factor in the overall number of tourists a destination receives once the tourist has arrived at the destination local transportation is also an important issue as it facilitates tourist mobility although it has received less attention there is practically no literature on empirical methodologies to assess the effects of new hsr lines on tourism high-speed rail hsr is a relatively new mode of transportation in the contemporary transportation technology revolution and has been promoted in various countries around the world albalate and bel 2012 in contrast the extensive literature on the link between air transportation and tourism dobruszkes and mondou 2013 has produced evidence of the significant effect of low-cost airlines on tourist outcomes rey et al 2011 most of the published studies in the literature on the tourism effects of hsr describe specific hsr experiences study cases and some observed hsr effects on tourism but do not point to a systemic methodology or a general conclusion guirao and soler 2008 bazin et al 2011 in hsr commuting relations it is important to take account of the fact that the possibility of returning within the same day can reduce the average length of the visitors stay this type of hsr service is quite common in some european countries such as france and spain see urea et al 2009 and may affect the interpretation of the main statistical tourism outputs tourism revenues number of overstays etc for example bazin et al 2011 studied the impact of hsr on urban and business tourism in french cities connected to paris such as lyon just 2 h away from paris by tgv train  grande vitesse and discovered that the daily expenditure of business tourists may be up to four times greater than that of leisure travellers bazin et al 2011 pointed out that business tourism can be a key strategic orientation for cities and large urban areas but the possibility of returning within the same day affects the average length of the tourists stay guirao and soler 2008 used a survey approach to examine the impact of tourism in toledo on traffic from the new madrid-toledo line commuters and tourists were the main users of the line and tourism accounted for over 30 of weekday hsr ridership apart from these isolated case studies applied to hsr we can distinguish three types of tools that are generally used to study the impact of transportation on the tourism industry the choice destination approach economic geography models and econometric models to estimate tourism demand the choice destination approach is based on ruggs model rugg 1973 was the first to introduce a time constraint the modification of the budget due to the transportation cost between alternative destinations and the modification of the time constraint resulting from including the time cost between alternative destinations assuming that tourists usually have a fixed holiday budget prideaux 2000 developed a model to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between holiday expenditure categories and the tourists point of origin the first approach to study the effects of hsr on tourist destination choice was developed by delaplace et al 2014 in paris and rome the data collected from a survey of tourists in both cities were used for a quantitative analysis using regression models the results showed that hsr influenced destination choice in different ways in the two cities with tourism in paris being more dependent on hsr this interesting contribution was continued by pagliara et al 2014 pagliara et al 2015 using madrid as a case study and also based on a revealed preference survey the preliminary results showed that the spanish hsr system appeared to have a significant effect on tourists decision to visit other cities connected to madrid but the choice of madrid as a tourist destination as in rome was not influenced by the presence of hsr although these results are quite illustrative the notion that destination choice may be influenced by hsr does not prove that the construction of a new line will automatically increase total tourism demand or tourist sector revenues at the destination accommodation restaurants museums and so on 
economic geography models like the core-periphery model introduced by krugman 1991 have also played an important role krugman 1991 showed that a change in transport cost induces a change in the intensity of spatial competition which in turn influences the location of firms masson and petiot 2009 used krugmans core-periphery model to explore the influence of the southern european high-speed railway line hsr between perpignan france and barcelona spain on both tourism activity and economic development using krugmans theory through a theoretical rather than an empirical discussion they argued that hsr can facilitate the development of tourism activities and particularly business and urban tourism crampon 1966 first introduced the gravitational model into tourism research and the only application of this approach to a hsr scenario dates from 2012 the projected effects not validated of chinese hsr on tourism were examined by applying the iso-tourist line from a time-space replacement concept wang et al 2012 they forecasted the effects of the hsr network on three aspects the redistribution and transformation of the tourist market market competition on a larger scale and the reallocation of the urban tourism centre however the results obtained by wang et al were not empirical and it is therefore important to quantify the increase in tourism demand in order to assess the influence of the new infrastructure in addition to economic geography models and the choice destination approach the existing literature on tourism demand is dominated by econometric models that tend to follow a single-equation time-series approach lim 1997 song and li 2008 song and wong 2003 the only approach of this type applied to hsr corridors was developed by chen and haynes 2012 through a multivariate panel analysis they investigated the impact of chinese high-speed rail systems on the tourism industry selecting only the numbers of incoming foreign tourists and tourism revenue as the dependent variables chen and haynes classified their independent variables into three groups policy variables all related to rail infrastructure and ridership origin variables related to the economic relation between foreign countries of origin and destinations and destination variables local site features or special events at the destination although the model does not consider domestic tourism this data was not publicly available in china at the provincial level the results of the research confirmed that policy variables have major significance in the model the study concluded that during the period between 1999 and 2010 chinese provinces with high-speed rail services were likely to have approximately 20 more foreign arrivals and 25 higher tourism revenues than provinces without these systems the authors empirically demonstrated that the presence of hsr services in each province boosted tourism in china more significantly than other local variables such as the number of world heritage sites or museums in 2015 a variation of this original model was developed by chen and haynes over the period 19972012 but using a panel of 21 source countries for tourism in china instead of provincial data other explanatory variables such as network density or number of stations were added in the equations and produced similar results particularly for the network density variable although this type of model is fairly dependent on the availability of a solid database and despite the fact that the chinese context is quite different from the european one the results obtained and the consistency of the model structure used by haynes and chen have encouraged the authors of this paper to extrapolate the methodology to the spanish case study the chinese scenario is among the most sustained attempts to systematize the study of hsr impact on tourism see also wang et al 2012 and in the literature the transfer of this methodology to the european scenario could be an important step towards obtaining extrapolated results 
section 3 below examines the main figures representing the structure of tourism in china and spain in order to understand and discuss the results of applying the model to the spanish case study in section 4 spain is one of the most popular tourist destinations worldwide occupying fourth place in 2014 in the world ranking of tourist arrivals behind france the us and china unwto 2015 while spain has traditionally been a tourist country international tourism arrivals in china started to grow after the open door policy was implemented in 1979 from 1980 to 2014 chinas inbound tourist arrivals and tourism revenues grew at an average annual rate of 96 and 11 respectively calculated with data from the national tourism administration of china nta 2002 to 2015 currently ranking as the worlds third most popular tourist destination china is expected to attract 130 million tourists annually by 2020 taking it to number one unwto 2015 the physical environment positively influences the choice of spain for tourism the country has 108 days per year of temperatures above 25 c and 2451 h of sunshine  equivalent to 67 h of sun a day it boasts 8000 km of coastline and the highest number of blue flag beaches in the world this is why leisure and holidays 84 are the main motivations for the majority of arrivals moreover 24 of spanish territory is classified as a protected area third in the european ranking and it has a total of 45 world heritage monuments and sites the third highest in the world unlike spain where sun and beach holidays are the main motivation for the majority of arrivals tourist resources in china fall into two main groups natural sites and historical and cultural sites china has 50 world heritage sites to date of these 35 are cultural sites 11 are natural sites and 4 are cultural and natural mixed sites ranking second in the world after italy 51 world heritage sites most are located in coastal regions which are also the hub of chinese economic power chinas mounting economic growth since 1978 has caused increasing disparity between the coastal and inland areas in almost all the major economic indicators pedroni and yao 2006 in spite of the concentration of tourist resources in the coastal areas the countrys vast extension 9597000 km2 versus 505000 km2 of spain means the distances between them are higher than in spain and aviation and hsr lines are the main transportation infrastructures on which foreign tourism is based chinas vast extension also means that seasonal weather conditions vary widely from region to region with temperatures as low as  40 c in the north and as high as 40 c in the south with major climate shifts limiting tourism during certain months of the year another issue influencing tourism demand is the high level of air pollution in chinas major urban and industrialised areas which may aggravate visitors bronchial sinus or asthmatic conditions there is scientific evidence beckena et al 2016 of the damage to destinations and risk perception that urban air pollution is causing to chinas inbound tourism the origin countries of foreign tourism in both spain and china are predominantly the neighbouring states in case of spain united kingdom 1940 germany 1687 france 1116 and italy 54 accounted for more than 42 of tourist arrivals in 2014 ine 2016b eu residents provide 71 of international arrivals in addition to a notable contingent of us 480 and russian 298 tourists spain also receives tourists with a high degree of loyalty to the destination measured as the number of times international tourists have visited the country on previous occasions in 2012 the official frontur report from the instituto turstico espaol ite 2013a showed that 802 of visitors claimed to have visited spain before in 2014 263608 million foreigners visited china of whom the largest group  a total of 163313 million  were asian 6195 national bureau of statistics of china 2015 most from south korea 256 the second largest share was from europe which contributed 55143 million visitors accounting for 2090 of the total while the numbers of asian visitors is currently growing the european market headed by russia has been declining since 2013 in third position was the us market with a total of 27603 million visitors 105 most visitors came to china for sightseeing or leisure activities while the second largest group comprised those attending conferences and business meetings accounting for 2069 
domestic tourism also reveals differences between spain and china in 2014 spain registered a balanced split between non-resident 51 and resident 49 tourists while domestic tourism in china represented over 90 of total visitors national bureau of statistics of china 2016 there are also significant differences in the evolution of these figures in spain the balance of non-resident and resident tourists has remained stable with a slight increase in the number of foreign visitors the number of domestic tourists in china was 3611 million in 2014 with a 200 increase in the period 20042014 1102 million in 2004 due to the countrys vast population and rising standard of living particularly in the last 30 years it should be noted that in most official national databases the number of foreign and domestic tourists is linked only to hotel stays overnights meaning that the total domestic visitors in both cases china and spain has been undervalued as there is no information on the number of tourists staying in apartments or second homes in terms of the territorial distribution of hsr fig 1
 and its relation with the main local tourist destinations spains network is structurally radial with the centre located in madrid it has been extended mainly towards the more populated eastern and southern cities barcelona valencia malaga seville most of which are located in the coastal area with high tourist attractiveness chinas network is concentrated mainly in the coastal area where all the major economic indicators are higher with four north-south lines two of which are fully operative beijing-harbin beijing-shanghai and the rest still in only partial operation beijing-guangzhou-shenzhen-hong kong hangzhou-fuzhou-shenzhen these four lines cover most of the tourist destinations beijing hong kong and shanghai or can be used as transport links to other remote destinations there are also two east-west lines which are still only partially operated qingdao-taiyuan shanghai-wuhan-chengdu the key issue in the interurban transport system when comparing china to spain concerns road infrastructure and conventional trains although china has invested heavily in transport infrastructure in the last twenty years spain had more than double the density of high-capacity roads 0030 kmkm2 than china 0012 kmkm2 in 2015 if hsr is considered together with conventional interurban rail lines this figure is even slightly higher 0031 versus 0012 this partly explains why the impact of hsr on the current transport system could be even higher in china than in spain accessibility to the main tourist destinations in spain before hsr started operation in 1992 was already guaranteed at a medium-high quality level at the urban level europe has a longstanding tradition of using and operating public transport and spanish public transit is of significantly higher quality than its chinese counterpart particularly in medium and small sized cities while transport and tourism infrastructure in spain is balanced between inland and coastal provinces many inland destinations in china have natural resources that could potentially represent a regional competitive advantage were they endowed with the necessary infrastructure conditions but have had difficulty in drawing both domestic and international visitors away from the popular coastal gateways jackson 2006 although the chinese tourism sector is currently experiencing one of its highest ever levels of growth public strategies to improve quality levels in the tourism offer are new and being implemented at great speed spain in its traditional role as a beach holiday country has developed innovative tourism policies by promoting inland areas of the country and diversifying into other spheres such as rural and urban tourism gastronomy shopping and health tourism oecd 2016 there is even a spanish rural tourism promotion plan for 2014 which is already producing results and a shopping tourism plan focused on asian markets a new health tourism cluster has also been created and is promoted internationally through the combined efforts of several ministries and the private sector other areas of diversification include golf tourism ecotourism and religious tourism spain can therefore be said to have a greater density of tourist destinations per km2 in addition to a wider diversification of tourism activities than china this latter point is interesting from a territorial point of view as hsr rail is not a permeable transport infrastructure like roads and the city to city link conditions the type of tourism itinerary the density of transport infrastructure is also higher in spain thereby increasing the accessibility to tourist destinations and supporting the hsr system by using hsr stations as useful intermodal nodes the following section describes the application of a multivariate panel data analysis to spain at the provincial level to explain the evolution of several tourism indicators using hsr among other destination variables the results are compared to those obtained in the chinese case study using the same methodology and the final analysis is supported by the tourism data provided in this section spain with more than 20 years of hsr experience and 3100 km of track in service offers a good opportunity to apply the chen and haynes model 2012 even though the direct application of this methodology to the spanish case poses several difficulties mainly concerning the adaptation of the statistical database to the variables used in the chinese case study the proposed model is based on a multivariate panel analysis at the provincial level spain is administratively divided into 17 regions and 50 provinces and all the provinces were considered except those located outside the iberian peninsula in the period from 1999 to 2015 as the first hsr line started operation in 1992 madrid-seville branch and was the only one table 1
 for over ten years this period covers most of the spanish hsr experience fig 1 highlights the differences between the spanish and chinese hsr networks and shows the extension of both countries the criteria used to select the tourism output the dependent variable in china focused on the availability of the related database number of foreign tourist arrivals taf and tourism revenue tr two different models  using the same structure but a different tourism output  were tested in order to quantify the impact of hsr lines on tourism in china it should be noted that data at the provincial level for domestic tourism demand was not publicly available so was not considered in the research 
table 2
shows the independent variables and their main descriptive statistics used by chen and haynes in their model they are classified into policy variables origin variables and destination variables the policy variables are all related to rail transportation features such as
passenger rail ridership rider measured in 10000 people per year introduced to capture the impact of the generic passenger railway system including both normal and high speed trains
length of railway rlen introduced as an alternative to reflect the impact of railway investment as no actual investment data is available at the provincial level
a hsr dummy variable hsr equal to one for the year and province that has a hsr service and zero otherwise this variable is perhaps the most relevant data to measure hsr effects as there were no itemised statistics available per line and province
 origin and destination variables are always present in demand transport models together with impedance variables travel time or distance as origin variables the authors use only the annual nominal exchange rate exc from the us dollar to the rmb renminbi the chinese legal tender a long list of destination variables is given in table 2 which can be perfectly extrapolated to case studies in other countries hotels number of world heritage sites museums and others although this model does not consider trip features such as travel time or distance it does take into account impedance variables such as the number of accidental pollution leaks pollution or the dummy variable associated to the outbreak of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome which originated in china in 2003 two special event dummy variables bjolympic shexpo were also introduced to monitor the influence of the 2008 beijing olympic games and the 2010 shanghai expo respectively in accordance with this approach tourism output the dependent variable in spain focused on similar tourism demand variables bearing in mind that the spanish national institute of statistics ine uses the term number of tourists rather than tourist arrivals to quantify the tourists visiting each province and calculates the figures from the data for overnight stays provided by hotels unlike china data on domestic tourism demand is publicly available in spain at the provincial level so the tourism output variables selected in the spanish case study were foreign tourists domestic tourists and revenues from foreign tourism in table 3
these variables are referred to as tanr number of non-resident tourists tar number of resident tourist and tr tourism revenue from non-resident tourists in spain three different models using the same structure but different tourism outputs were tested in order to quantify the impact of hsr lines on spanish tourism the following policy variables all related to rail transportation features were used in the spanish case study rlen quantifies the national rail length including the conventional rail network rider is the total rail ridership including conventional rail traffic and hsr dummy variable is the hsr presence at the provincial level it was more difficult to design the origin variables as only foreign tourism was considered in the chinese study the authors used the annual nominal exchange rate exc from the us dollar to the rmb renminbi according to statistics from ine ine 2016b in 2014 more than 71 of foreign tourism in spain came from the european union our exchange variable is therefore defined as the difference between the provincial and european eurozone gdp referring to 1999 currency to avoid the effect of inflation the origin of domestic tourism is more difficult to determine and no origin variable related to gdp was used 
table 3 shows the rest of the independent variables and their main descriptive statistics added to the spanish models apart from the local economic variable used in the chinese case study  the gross provincial product per capita gpppc  significant efforts were made to collect the same multidimensional features of local tourism used in the original model number of world heritage sites whs starred restaurants resta museums museum and public libraries lib art galleries are included in the museum database in the spanish case 4-star hotels are the most popular with both domestic and foreign visitors ine 2016b so the hotel variable hotel included the number of 4- and 5-star hotels unlike the chinese case study in the time period considered 19992015 no special impedance variables were taken into account such as accidental pollution leaks or the outbreak of sars in china it was decided to overlook these variables as no comparable cases have occurred in spain and owing to the high degree of loyalty of visitors to spain spanish institute of tourism 2012 instead three special dummy variables relating to major international cultural and sporting events were introduced as attracting indicators the forum 2004 in barcelona forum the americas cup in valencia in 2007 amcup and the international exhibition in zaragoza in 2008 expoz these events have been recognised for their relevance in the research work of renau 2010 in spain there is another additional variable in the model called year not linked to origin destination or policy features which groups the sequence of observations and measures time trends before designing the equations for the spanish case study the preliminary multicollinearity data analysis found high correlations between the explanatory variables rider and rlen as in chen and haynes research this led the authors to present two separate models per output variable eqs 1 and 2 show the general structure of the multivariate analysis using panel data subindices i and t denote destination provinces and time period respectively while y represents the dependent variables number of domestic tourists number of foreign tourists and total foreign tourist revenue a fixed effects model fe was developed for the unobserved individual effect in a panel model consisting of a statistical model that represents the observed quantities in terms of explanatory variables that are treated as if the quantities were non-random1lnyit11lnriderit2lngpppcit3lnhotelit4whsit5libit6museumit7exchangeit8forumit9amcupt10expozt11year12hsrit

table 4
shows the determinants of the number of foreign tourists in spain compared with the results of chen and haynes 2012 model 1 considers rail ridership as a policy variable while model 2 uses network length this multivariate analysis methodology is repeated again in table 5
to study the determinants of foreign tourism revenue in spain model 3 with ridership model 4 with length table 6
shows the results for the output number of domestic tourists obtained from two multivariate analysis applied to the spanish panel data one using the independent variable rlen and the other using rider in the case of foreign tourism models 1 2 3 and 4 the first finding in the spanish study concerns local site characteristics such as the number of 5-star hotels starred restaurants world heritage sites and museums these variables were not statistically significant in china in any of the models designed while in spain some indicators such as the hotel variable are statistically significant at the 1 level the hotel variable coefficients in the four models range between 0941 and 0591 other local site characteristics such as museums and libraries show high levels of significance although their coefficients are much lower than for the hotel variables these results are consistent with the spanish offer at the destination not only beach and sun attractions but a greater diversification of areas such as rural and urban tourism gastronomy shopping museums health tourism eco-tourism and others all concentrated in the same physical location or within an easily accessible radius of influence using the transport system our explanation is that in spain the destination variables benefit from reinforcement and favourable complementarity in addition to the fact that the country has a higher density of tourist destinations per km2 compared to china the reason the hotel coefficient is higher in spain than in china is probably due to the convenience for tourists of being able to choose between a range of different four- and five-star hotel chains at the destination and to the way these hotels are linked to a range of other tourist attractions the insignificant results for the event variables are similar for the chinese and the spanish experience special events such as the 2008 beijing olympic games and the 2010 shanghai expo and the number of pollution incidents are not statistically significant even at the 1 level however the dummy year of 2003 in china  representing that years sars epidemic  is highly statistically significant this is to be expected since sars had a fairly strong negative effect on foreign tourist arrivals no deterrent event variable was introduced in the spanish model and the results for the special events are consistent with the chinese ones among all the explanatory variables it is not surprising to find that the gross provincial product per capita gpppc variable has a significant impact on the number of foreign tourists in both china and spain in china the elasticities are 0459 and 0495 which can be interpreted as a 1 increase in the gpppc associated to an increase of around 046 to 05 in foreign tourist arrivals in spain the level of significance of the variable is even higher 1 for foreign tourism output and the coefficients are higher which supports the idea that visitors appreciate not only the presence of sun and beach at the destination but also the socioeconomic environment in contrast the gross provincial product per capita is not significant for the spanish revenue output models which may mean that tourist expenditure in spain is not dependent on the price levels in the province in richer provinces hotels and restaurants tend to be more expensive another key determinant is the exchange rate exc which represents the price level of tourism in comparison with the countries of origin in both china and spain the positive sign of this coefficient indicates that when the price levels in the destination are lower than in the origin countries the number of visitors increases this coefficient was higher in the chinese than in the spanish case study indicating that tourism in spain is less sensitive to price levels another argument that supports this idea is that most tourists in spain come from other eu nations 71 in 2014 and the differences in these price levels are less pronounced the low sensitivity to price levels is reinforced by the fact that spain tends to welcome tourists with a high degree of loyalty to the destination in the revenue models in both china and spain the exchange rate is less significant as a variable than the gross provincial product per capita gpppc and is unimportant in terms of significance while ridership and length are not significant among railway variables the dummy indicator hsr plays an important role in the chinese and spanish foreign tourism models especially in the case of tourism revenues the hsr variable is statistically significant at the 1 significance level in the chinese and spanish revenue models table 5 but only 5 significant in the demand models number of foreign tourists table 4 these results are the key findings of this paper and indicate that spanish provinces with hsr receive more foreign tourists and more revenues than provinces without this service nevertheless the hsr coefficients for spain are much lower than for china showing that the effect of hsr is much higher in china than in spain the highest coefficient in the revenue models in china is around 025 implying that provinces with hsr services were likely to have approximately 25 more tourism revenues than provinces without in spain the highest coefficient see models 3 and 4 in table 4 is 0017 indicating that provinces with hsr services were likely to have 17 more tourism revenues the highest hsr coefficient in china in foreign tourism demand models models 1 and 2 table 4 is around 0201 suggesting that provinces with hsr services were likely to have 201 more tourists while this percentage is only 13 in spain these results can be explained by the fact that as mentioned in section 3 distances between tourist destinations are greater in china than in spain and the transport alternative to hsr is a lower density network high-capacity roads and conventional trains accessibility to the main tourist destinations in spain before hsr started operation in 1992 was already guaranteed at a medium-high quality level and the impact of hsr on tourism indicators is thus less important in the case of domestic tourists models 5 and 6 and local site features as in the case of foreign tourists the only significant variables are the number of hotels and the number of libraries this latter with a low coefficient neither the variable whs or museum is statistically significant highlighting the importance of spanish coastal destinations for this type of tourism in support of this argument data from the familitur report ite 2013b revealed that the three major destinations for domestic tourism were andalusia catalonia and the region of valencia accounting for almost 50 of visitor share these three regions have a considerable extension of coastline and the temperatures are excellent for sun and beach tourism the only significant event variable is expozaragoza in 2008 with a high significance 1 nevertheless as in the foreign tourism models the value of the coefficient between 0003 and 0005 reveals its low real impact on the domestic tourist sector the economic explanatory variable gpppc has the highest significances lower than 1 in both rider and rlen models and high coefficients 0214 and 0215 respectively this finding underlines the considerable importance of tourism for the spanish provincial economy and its significant and positive role for regional economic growth as noted by previous studies corts-jimnes 2008 in relation to policy variables neither ridership nor the length and existence of hsr are significant not even at 10 significance according to the familitur report ite 2013b in 2012 the private car represented over 84 of the modal split in domestic tourist trips indicating that the improvement in the speed and comfort of the rail network is not sufficient on its own to modify the mobility patterns of spanish families this may be explained by the higher costs perceived by travellers in comparison with the private car when more than one person is travelling which is very common in family tourism patterns in conclusion the results show that hsr in spain has positively affected foreign tourism outputs especially revenues although its impact is not as important as in china there is no clear evidence of its effect on domestic tourism hsr impacts on tourism in a country like china where the alternative interurban transport network is less developed than in europe are of a higher magnitude and easier to detect with an econometric model further research is required on the use of hsr variables which need to describe not only the existence of lines at the provincial level but also the connectivity and territorial distribution of the hsr network and the service conditions offered by the operating companies fares timetables and frequency for example in spain and france some hsr lines are used by commuters and in some cases tourism is an important trip purpose none of these commuter visitors stay in hotels and therefore do not appear as tourists in the official statistics in conclusion the model would benefit from a greater level of data disaggregation and a better understanding of the territorial distribution of hsr lines through new explanatory variables relating hsr operating conditions and including new tourism outputs based on overstays in hotels and number of visitors to the main tourism attractions or disaggregated revenues per sector restaurants museums and others apart from the abovementioned drawbacks of the methodology applied to both china and spain there is another issue arising from this research after applying the model to the spanish case it still remains to be clarified whether hsr development and tourism have a simultaneous effect and whether this system is really endogenous although a circular and cumulative causation between hsr demand and tourism demand is always expected in these territorial systems it is essential to separate any crossover effects or at least identify which has the greater impact hsr on tourism indicators or tourism on hsr demand in the next section a simple empirical analysis of endogeneity is applied to a specific spanish destination toledo in order to demonstrate by example that this separation can be achieved and derived from empirical data in order to test endogeneity between hsr demand and tourism indicators we selected toledo a mid-sized tourist city in central spain with almost 78000 inhabitants as a case study toledo is located 70 km south of madrid and has been linked to madrid by a hsr line since november 2005 it was declared a world heritage site by the unesco in 1986 for its extensive cultural and monumental heritage and the historical co-existence of christian muslim and jewish cultures before construction work started on the new line rail traffic in the previous conventional line was not insignificant over 800000 passengers in 2002 and rose to over 1300000 passengers in this decade as shown in fig 2
 the madrid-toledo hsr line is successful in terms of traffic not only due to the hsr link to madrid and its attractiveness to tourists but also because of the type of service provided by the operating company since 2005 toledo has enjoyed avant services with over ten daily hsr shuttles 30 min travel time and is also favoured by the availability of monthly tickets which are economically highly advantageous compared to ordinary one-way tickets if the schedules are compatible with work timetables this frequency enables their use for commuting with the result that over 60 of users of the madrid-toledo hsr line have been found to be commuters the first indicator we quantified was the evolution of the number of tourists in toledo drawing on tourism data provided by the spanish national statistical institute ine covering 50 provinces and a limited number of tourist points within a time span of 15 years 19982013 data at the provincial level were used to calibrate the multivariate regression model in section 3 but more detailed data are available as toledo is considered a tourist point by the ine in both database sources the number of tourists indicator is calculated by the ine using only the results of the survey of hotel occupancy so this analysis must take into account that visitors to these cities who do not spend at least one night at the destination are still not registered as tourists in the case of toledo the number of tourists comprises two thirds of the visitors at the provincial level and disaggregation between resident and non-resident tourists in spain has only been available from 2005 in the tourist point ine database in addition to the evolution of the number of tourists in toledo we studied other indicators such as the number of museum visitors htickets sold and its evolution before and after the implementation of the new hsr line as the church of santo tom  the home of the famous painting the burial of the count of orgaz  is one of the most visited museums in the city we recorded the data for tickets sold per year fig 2a also shows the number of tourists and overnight stays in toledo before and after the inauguration of hsr services in 2005 together with the evolution of rail passengers and the main museum visitors an average of 26 of tourists are non-resident in spain there was a sharp rise in the number of travellers after the opening of the hsr line bearing in mind that commuters account for 60 of hsr traffic the increase in both the number of tourists and number of visitors to the santo tom museum is much more limited and appears to be more a result of other factors revealing no clear evidence of the influence of hsr on these tourism variables fig 2b shows the evolution of the number of resident and non-resident tourists in the province of toledo for 20002013 the period 20002005 is not covered at this disaggregation level by the ines urban database of tourist points there is no appreciable influence of hsr on residents while a slight positive influence can be observed on non-residents this is consistent with the results of the model applied to spain in section 4 foreign tourism in spain is more positively affected by hsr than domestic tourism although the spanish financial crisis which started in 2005 may have influenced this fact the fall in all the variables since 2008 with a greater impact on the number of visitors to the santo tom museum than on the number of travellers or the number of visitors can be explained by the spanish financial and socioeconomic climate after 2005 this data context highlights the difficulties of assessing the influence of hsr on tourism indicators but reveals that its influence may even be negligible for some types of tourism in the case of toledo the road infrastructure between madrid and toledo is perfectly covered by both a free dual carriageway a-42 and a toll motorway ap-41 while regular bus services offer frequencies of 30 min and travel times of 60 min hsr travel time is 30 min with a frequency of 60 min there are multiple alternatives to hsr in order to find more empirical evidence on circular and cumulative causation we also analysed the evolution of the number of restaurant licenses in the city of toledo from 2000 530 licenses to 2013 800 licenses which revealed that the annual growth rate was fairly continuous regardless of the opening of the hsr line additionally it is difficult to assess in the short term whether hsr contributes to improving the image of a tourist city apart from the madrid-seville line most spanish hsr lines have been in operation for under ten years which is too soon to analyse or model this kind of indirect effect toledo was an important spanish tourism destination before 2005 despite its lack of hsr in any case the improvement of the image of a tourist city in the long run will be seen in the increase in most of the tourism outputs and revenues after studying the local case of toledo we can state that within this cause-effect relation the effect of tourism on hsr demand may be much more important than the effect of hsr infrastructure on tourism indicators evidently tourism will always be an object of trip generation but when a tourism destination already has a high rate of transport accessibility a new mode does not add a large number of new tourists but produces a new transport modal split in the access to destination this example shows how this cause-effect relation may be totally unbalanced towards the benefits of hsr demand in other destinations this fact will depend on the alternative transport modes for accessing the tourist destination and the type of tourism affected resident or non-resident as they clearly behave in a different way lastly local strategies to promote tourism are also important toledo is clearly a cultural destination but gastronomy and rural and ecotourism have also been publicly promoted at the provincial level in recent years hsr is only one of the possible gateways to the destination but depending on the country and the province concerned this can either be the optimal gateway or simply a complement to other existing ones the literature review shows how tourism has affected hsr demand although little research has been done to date to empirically estimate the opposite effect of hsr on tourism indicators chen and haynes were the first to study this impact through a multivariate panel analysis obtaining positive results and showing that in the period between 1999 and 2010 fledgling high-speed rail services significantly boosted tourism in china the analysis considered only foreign rather than domestic tourism due to the lack of data available at the provincial level the most effective first step for obtaining a systematic tool to evaluate the integral impact of hsr on the tourism industry is to conduct a detailed study of the applicability of the chinese experience with spain and china coming top of the rankings for the most visited tourist countries along with france and the us and the longest hsr networks in operation spain can be considered the most suitable country for validating this tool the tourism structure in both china and spain was studied in order to define the main differences and gain a greater understanding of the modelling results and the following key issues were identified tourism motivations levels of transport accessibility to tourism destinations weather limitations evolution of domestic tourism and public strategies to promote tourism the authors have made considerable efforts to adapt the spanish database to the variables defined in the chinese analysis introducing new variables when necessary and eliminating any that are not applicable to the spanish scenario six different models were designed using the following dependent variables number of foreign visitors number of domestic visitors and foreign revenue for each dependent variable two equations were defined one using ridership and other railway length the rail variables the key issue in this research show that while ridership and length are not really significant the hsr dummy variable plays a clear positive role in the increase in both the number of foreign tourist arrivals and revenues and is highly significant with a positive sign nevertheless the coefficients obtained for spain are surprisingly low compared to china and reveal that spanish provinces with hsr receive about 13 more tourists and 17 more revenues 201 and 250 respectively for china these differences are explained by the greater distances between tourist destinations in china combined with the fact that the transport alternative to hsr is a lower density network high-capacity roads and conventional trains accessibility to the main tourist destinations in spain before hsr started operation in 1992 was already guaranteed at a medium-high quality level and hsr impact on tourism indicators is thus less important in the case of domestic tourism neither ridership nor the length and existence of hsr are significant not even at 10 significance it can therefore be concluded that the improvement in the speed and comfort of the journey implied by hsr is not sufficient on its own to modify the mobility patterns of spanish residents in 2012 the private car represented over 84 of the modal split in domestic tourist trips and that the higher costs perceived by travellers in comparison with the private car is crucial in determining domestic mobility patterns another interesting finding deriving from the modelling is the differing significance of the destination variables number of hotels museums and libraries that positively influence foreign tourism in spain but not in china suggesting that the reinforcement and favourable complementarity of the destination variables are especially good public strategies to promote tourism combined with a higher density of tourist destinations per km2 and greater accessibility to them this defines a different scenario for spain in which hsr plays a secondary role notwithstanding the limitations of the tourism databases focused mainly on hotel occupancy further research is required on the use of hsr variables which should describe  in addition to the existence of lines at the provincial level  the connectivity and territorial distribution of the hsr network and the service conditions offered by the operating companies fares timetables and frequency the models ability to analyse circular and cumulative causation between hsr and tourism has also been discussed as a drawback of the methodology used in this research although a cause-effect analysis would require a longer-term database series than available at present over 20 years of hsr operation this approach could be a first step towards improving the modelling in order to clarify this issue the authors have completed their research with a local case study toledo spain with more disaggregated data to demonstrate how the effect of hsr on tourism indicators is ultimately less important than the impact of tourism on hsr demand for some countries and cities tourism can represent a real priority and a source of income and the validated methodology presented in this paper will ultimately provide authorities and policymakers with useful tools to estimate the real contribution to tourism development of a new or existing hsr line without requiring the use of an a priori unfounded hypothesis  sag

rapid review and meta-synthesis corresponding author jo billings brian fung chi ching  vasiliki gkofa talya greene michael bloomfield  healthcare workers across the world have risen to the demands of treating covid-19 patients potentially at significant cost to their own health and wellbeing there has been increasing recognition of the potential mental health impact of covid-19 on frontline healthcare workers and growing calls to provide psychosocial support for them however little attention has so far been paid to understanding the impact of working on a pandemic from healthcare workers own perspectives or what their views are about support this rapid review identified 40 qualitative studies which have explored healthcare workers experiences and views from previous pandemics including and comparable to covid-19 meta-synthesis of this qualitative data using thematic analysis derived eight key themes which transcended pandemics time and geographical boundaries this pandemic is not unprecedented the themes that arose from previous pandemics were remarkably resonant with what we are hearing about the impact of covid-19 globally today we have an opportunity to learn from the lessons of these previous pandemics mitigate the negative mental health impact of covid-19 and support the longer-term wellbeing of the healthcare workforce worldwide  we have been hearing repeatedly from across the world about the mental health burden faced by frontline healthcare workers as they work to treat patients affected by covid-19 media representations have described frontline healthcare workers on their knees in response to the crisis leading to forewarning of an ensuing mental health epidemic amongst the healthcare workforce ghebreyesus 2020 holmes et al 2020  covid-19 has placed extreme demands on healthcare workers they have been facing genuine threats to their own physical safety and indirectly to that of their families they have had to manage higher numbers of patients with high mortality rates in a high-pressure environment they have faced challenges in delivering care with strict infection control measures in place and not always with adequate personal protective equipment ppe many have been redeployed into new roles or newly purposed wards so have been working in unfamiliar settings and without established social support from colleagues healthcare workers are for the most part psychologically resilient professionals brooks et al 2020  trained and experienced in dealing with illness and death however the mental health and psychological wellbeing of this group prior to the current covid-19 pandemic was already being identified as a major healthcare issue evidenced by the growing incidence of stress burnout depression drug and alcohol dependence and suicide across all groups of health professionals in many countries carrieri et al 2018  high stress roles coupled with the unique demands of the current covid-19 crisis have undoubtedly placed frontline healthcare workers at additional risk for mental health problems with early reports from around the world indicating elevated rates of depression anxiety post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd and suicidality gunnell et al 2020 lai et al 2020 rossi et al 2020  in response to many military metaphors of healthcare workers waging war on the front line against covid-19 there have been growing calls to mobilise mental health support for healthcare workers however there is currently a lack of evidence about what interventions are most helpful for staff working in such high risk occupational roles with what evidence there is about effectiveness being mixed and often demonstrating that well intentioned interventions ie debriefing can actually increase the likelihood of developing mental health problems such as ptsd rose et al 2002  national institute for health and care excellence 2018 emerging literature from around the world has also demonstrated that staff may not prioritise psychological interventions in the peak phase of the crisis and may even be reluctant to engage with services offered to them chen et al 2020  so what is it like to work on the frontline and what support do frontline healthcare workers want during a pandemic such as covid-19 we set out to answer this question by providing a rapid review and meta-synthesis of qualitative literature describing healthcare workers experiences of working on the frontline and their views about psychosocial support during covid-19 or comparable pandemics such as sars mers or ebola we adhered to prisma moher et al 2009 guidance throughout this review we identified eligible papers through searches on medline psychinfo and pubmed final searches took place on may 5 2020 key search terms were related to the population ie healthcare workers the intervention ie psychosocial psychological or emotional and experiences support intervention or help and a number of disease specific key terms ie covid-19 sars mers h1n1 ebola see appendix for our full list of search terms we hand searched reference lists of included papers and grey literature to identify other potentially relevant studies we included papers which reported original published qualitative research describing frontline healthcare workers experiences of working during a pandemic andor views of psychosocial support offered to them this included mixed-methods studies where data on the qualitative component of the study was available we excluded studies where less than 50 of the participants were frontline healthcare workers and we could not extract data for healthcare workers alone due to the rapidity of this review only papers published in english were included although retrieved papers covered a global context we removed duplicate articles then titles and abstracts of retrieved papers were screened for relevance by two independent reviewers the full texts of remaining articles were then read by the two independent reviewers we resolved any discrepancies about papers to be included at any stage through discussion between the two reviewers and the first author data from the selected papers was extracted onto a pre-designed data extraction template by the two reviewers see table 1  we included all papers in the qualitative meta-synthesis we assessed the quality of the studies included in the meta-synthesis using the critical appraisal skills programme casp 2017 qualitative research checklist see table 2  the quality appraisal was carried out by two independent reviewers and discrepancies were resolved through discussion the casp checklists are designed to be used as educational pedagogic tools and therefore are not intended to derive a quantitative rating for quality in this review we have followed casp guidance and the methods described by lachal et al 2017 to describe whether studies met partially met or did not meet the casp criteria this information is provided to enable the reader to judge study quality for themselves see appendix of note these ratings reflect what is included in the available report of the study and may not necessarily reflect detail that was attended to in the research process but not necessarily written up in the presented paper we did not exclude any studies from the meta-synthesis based on their quality this is a new and emerging topic of concern and we did not want to exclude smaller scale studies from less well-established settings given the insight they could potentially offer to this review question we followed guidance provided by lachal et al 2017 on synthesising qualitative literature in psychiatry we extracted data from the results sections of papers or general text in the case of published commentaries or reflective accounts where information was given about healthcare workers experiences andor views of any form of psychosocial support provided during their work in response to a pandemic this data was exported into nvivo pro version 12 and analysed thematically braun  clarke 2006  in keeping with traditional thematic analysis we sought initial immersion in the data by reading and re-reading all the papers we developed an initial coding frame from ten of the most immediately relevant and current papers the coding frame was further developed and refined through coding of the full 40 papers looking for shared themes but also nuances and exceptions within the themes adhering to the principles of inductive methodology we sought to derive our themes from the data in this case the themes and examples given in the original papers but then to synthesise these findings and develop an overarching set of themes and sub-themes which captured the experiences and views of frontline healthcare workers across the studies reflexivity is important in all qualitative research and enables the reader to consider the validity of any qualitative analysis by better understanding the composition and position of the research team who have produced it this research team is made up of a diverse group representing different clinical specialities career stages and cultural backgrounds jb is a consultant clinical psychologist and associate clinical professor specialising in trauma ptsd and the mental health and wellbeing of high-risk occupational groups jb is also a specialist qualitative researcher with extensive experience of conducting qualitative research systematic reviews and meta-syntheses bcfc and vg are both msc students in clinical mental health both have received extensive training on conducting systematic reviews tg is a senior lecturer specialising in ptsd and responses to mass traumatic events mb is a ucl excellence principal clinical research fellow and honorary consultant psychiatrist at the traumatic stress clinic a specialist service for post-traumatic stress disorder in london and university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust as such we brought a mix of different perspectives and experience to this topic a total of 896 records were initially returned 34 articles were identified through other sources hand searching of reference lists after de-duplication the titles and abstracts of 700 articles were screened by the two reviewers of these 604 were agreed to not be relevant resulting in 96 studies which were read in full by the two reviewers at this stage 56 studies were excluded as either the wrong study design n56 or not having relevant outcomes n11 this resulted in 40 papers which we included in the review and meta-synthesis

africa six in north america three in australasia and two in europe fourteen studies looked at experiences related to sars 14 to ebola four to unspecified influenza pandemics three to mers two at h1n1 two at covid-19 one at avian flu and one at swine flu most participants were described as healthcare workers nurses or medical staff all studies were published between 1999 and 2020 in most studies

analytic methods were used including thematic analysis content analysis framework analysis and phenomenological analysis although many papers did not state the specific method used to analyse their

concern across most staff groups was becoming infected with the virus themselves gershon et al 2016 writing about healthcare volunteers experiences of treating ebola in emergency treatment units etus in west africa describe thoughts of getting infected were the uppermost concern for most especially during the beginning of the deployment when they were still becoming acclimated to the etu and whenever there was a breach in infection control protocol and practice for some fear was constant one participant recalled constantly thinking dont let me get ebola dont let me get ebola fears of contamination were exacerbated by experiences of inadequate ppe which was a recurrent theme across many papers transcending different countries and pandemics shih et al 2007 explored nurses experiences of treating sars in taiwan in the early 2000s and noted in this beginning stage the factors contributing to the nurses fear about fatal infection by sars were based on a lack of defensive protection against the disease thirteen years later yin  zeng 2020 document nurses experiences of treating covid-19 in china and quote one of their participants i hope that personal protective equipment is available every day so that i dont have to worry as much about myself or my colleagues getting infected a few studies provided exceptions where frontline workers reported less concern over their own immediate health but nevertheless still expressed significant concerns for others workers were preoccupied about their families becoming ill and were particularly concerned that they themselves might transmit the illness to their loved ones for example talking about nurses experiences of sars in singapore koh et al 2012 reported that some participants were not concerned about themselves rather they were concerned that they would because of their exposure to infected patients colleagues or visitors to the organization inadvertently infect their family many made sacrifices and sought to protect their loved ones by staying away from them for example yin and zeng 2020 quote a nurse in china in the early stages of covid-19 i stay at a hotel every day and am afraid of getting my family sick im afraid to go home and havent seen my mom and dad for a long time fellow healthcare workers falling ill with the virus was a significant cause for preoccupation and distress amongst participants all of the participants described being particularly vulnerable when caring for patients who were healthcare workers whether doctors nurses or support staff who had contracted the disease at work that the patients were colleagues in a similar situation in life gave a more personally emotive dimension of the experience erland et al 2017  healthcare workers were also impacted by practical and environmental issues in the settings in which they worked whilst for the most part healthcare workers fears were allayed by adequate ppe it was also noted in several papers how the ppe caused discomfort and impacted on communication the equipment was described as cumbersome and hot and staff reported finding it difficult to communicate with others who were wearing the ppe basic clinical procedures were deemed impossible by participants while wearing the recommended ppe broom et al 2017  some studies commented on the pay off between staff safety and patient care for example moore et al 2005 describing the treatment of sars in canada quote one participant what weve been told isthat in triage you change your goggles gloves mask and gown between every patient and its 100 not feasible it cant be done patients would be dying waiting at the triage desk many studies also commented on the settings in which healthcare workers treated those affected by the pandemic being unfit for purpose and lacking in essential resources talking about nurses experiences of the ebola crisis in west africa gershon et al 2016 state by any measure and at multiple levels the early humanitarian response to the ebola epidemic was extraordinarily challenging health care facilities and systems already severely under-resourced in the affected areas were strained to the limit this was not unique to developing countries with similar challenges reported in canada moore et al 2005 and australia broom et al 2017  healthcare workers commonly reported elevated workloads which impacted on their psychosocial wellbeing they cited increased hours and weekend shifts additional time taken to manage ppe and increased paperwork as frequent sources of stress this was compounded by staff shortages due to inadequate staffing or staff absences because of ill health or caring responsibilities resulting in requirements for staff to work overtime this led to the workers feeling fatigued and risking mistakes a nurse from toronto in the study by moore et al 2005 described her experiences i work 12-hour shifts in emergency rarely got a break we were not permitted to have fluids at the desk none none in the care area so we were going for five or six hours with nothing to drink we were so exhausted so at the end of your 12 hour shift by 6 or 7 hours youre so exhausted that youre crazy that is now leading to sloppy practice however because of staff shortages some participants were noted to describe feeling guilty for taking time off to rest gershon et al 2016 rubin et al 2016  even when able to take a break this was not always possible several studies described staff being unable to leave the hospital or hotel environment feeling isolated outside of work or having little access to other activities rubin et al 2016 im et al 2018  financial consequences of working or not working during the pandemic were also discussed for some sickness entitlements were considerably less than usual salaries and some staff were not paid at all if unable to work this led to significant financial hardship and a motivation for some to work even when unwell some were offered a risk allowance for the work that they undertook which was a source of motivation for some although professional duty of care usually outweighed financial incentives for most nevertheless when financial remuneration was offered but delayed or not provided workers felt abandoned and betrayed such betrayals of trust exacerbated pre-existing disaffection amongst healthcare workers the sars epidemic changed my view of nursing in ontario i finally realized that nurses were undervalued underappreciated and undercompensated for the risks they take on daily to provide adequate healthcare to their clients bergeron et al 2006  participants in many of the studies talked about experiencing stigma as a result of working on the pandemic this was greatest in the earlier phases of the outbreaks or in contexts where less was understood about transmission of the virus in addition to their own fear of becoming infected with ebola the midwives also had to deal with the public fear of the contagious disease ebola was an unknown disease in sierra leone prior to the outbreak and lack of knowledge resulted in rumours and misunderstandings among the general population erland et al 2017  this stigma extended to the families of healthcare workers with some reporting their children being discriminated against kim 2018  other studies pointed to the hypocrisy that some healthcare

al 2018  one of the greatest sources of tension was the competing obligation healthcare workers felt between providing good patient care and protecting their own physical safety strict infection control procedures meant that staff were not always able to intervene in the way they wanted resulting in them feeling like they fell short of their usual standards of care the biggest conflict within me was the lack of abilityto put your hand on a shoulderor hold their hand lamb et al 2018  further constraints due to lacking resources exacerbated healthcare workers distress and led to a sense of futility comments such as i couldnt do anything to help smith et al 2017 and we could not do enough liu  liehr 2009  pervaded many narratives several studies discussed the undignified manner of patient deaths and healthcare workers lack of ability to provide access to adequate pain medication or give them any measure of comfort as a great source of distress staff shortages and the associated lack of support meant workers were left to make difficult often life and death decisions on their own which were noted to cause serious ethical dilemmas inequalities and decisions about who should get access to resources beds medication and vaccines also caused staff significant upset the impact of these dilemmas appeared to continue after the crisis had passed participants reported feelings of grief mourning sadness depression remorse and regret upon their return as one participant said oh we could have done much much more gershon et al 2016 nevertheless for the most part workers felt inherently motivated to undertake this work and held a strong conviction that not doing so would be unethical the idea of not treating patients affected by the virus was seen as cowardly lam  hung 2013 and morally unacceptable ives et al 2009  and staff who avoided this work were viewed with scepticism concurrent to the pressures noted above many healthcare workers described aspects of the work as enjoyable and rewarding and appeared to derive job satisfaction from work that they felt was important and meaningful bensimon et al 2007  these sentiments seemed more pronounced when workers saw patients improve and leave the ward and over time as the number of infections and deaths declined the gratitude of others patients their families and wider society was noted to increase their sense of fulfilment even in some of the most challenging moments many healthcare workers found meaning in their work for example erland and dahl 2017 describe midwives caring from pregnant women dying from ebola in sierra leone who found it meaningful to be there and care for the women in their last moment of life overcoming such immense challenges tested the participants and imbued some with a sense of greater professional confidence and competency several studies described staff gaining new knowledge and skills which they felt would equip them in their future work especially if they ever worked in a pandemic situation again some also reported personal growth and developing confidence in their own resilience nevertheless deriving meaning and taking pride in their achievements did not render healthcare workers immune from the longer lasting impact of the work  sources of support were discussed in many of the papers although healthcare workers experiences demonstrated that many potential sources of support could also be additional sources of stress families and friends were important sources of support but could place pressure on the healthcare workers some tried to dissuade them from working on the pandemic leading the workers in some cases to withhold from their families what they were doing for the most part healthcare workers appreciated the opportunity to stay in touch with friends and family usually over the phone this was reported to bring them comfort as well as allay the worries of their loved ones however this could still place an emotional burden on the workers sometimes i was too tired to talk over the phone but i still wanted to switch on the mobile because i was concerned about my familys conditioni found i could not control my temper during that period after two sentences of talk with my family i felt short of breath and became very frustrated i understood that my family would like to listen to my voice but i just could not talk mok et al 2005  the competing demands of managing work and family life during a pandemic was also a source of stress as described by bergeron et al 2006 during sars in canada reintegrating into normal family life after their work on the pandemic was over was also problematic for some several studies described workers missing colleagues and struggling to re-engage with previous work your heart is just not into it gershon et al 2016  for the most part working with colleagues during the pandemic was noted to provide an important source of mutual support opportunities to learn from each other and facilitate camaraderie buddying systems whereby more experienced staff supported newer staff seemed appreciated as were opportunities for informal group reflection this seemed to enable staff groups to normalise difficult responses and provide appropriate reassurance as described in lambs 2018 study of ebola participants described how they would simply sit down together at the end of a shift share a cup of tea and discuss the events of the day quite a few of them juniors had never seen a dead body before certainly never dealt with dying patients  but we would just sort of just sit down and chat about it and about how they were feelingit was ok to feel upset its just a perfectly normal reaction some healthcare workers also spoke about the value of social media platforms for keeping in touch with colleagues such as whatsapp groups some did nevertheless lament the loss of previous opportunities to socialise with colleagues face to face and outside of work yin  zeng 2020 colleague and peer relationships could also be the source of some stress unfair distribution of work and the refusal of some colleagues to treat patients affected by the virus caused notable tensions there was real division created amongst staff wed all be working in the icu and there was a long list of people who said theyre not going in because of so and soand this created resentment hostility because there were a core group of us who went in there more often than we would have had to otherwise had all of us been sharing that responsibility we carried a burden that wasnt equally shared bergeron et al 2006  this was exacerbated by inequities in pay and conditions for what healthcare professionals perceived to be equivalent work with the same risks healthcare workers valued support from their organisations but gave examples of not feeling adequately supported some workers reported feeling coerced into working with infected patients or in inappropriate  cc-by-nd 40 international license it

httpsdoiorg101101 conditions participants across the studies felt that their organisations had an institutional duty to provide staff with sufficient protection to work safely workers reported feeling supported by their organisations when there was clear alignment and shared decision making between senior managers and frontline healthcare workers but less supported when staff safety was not a clear priority workers also valued their organisations supporting them to take time off from their roles workers perceptions of their organisations preparedness varied with workers in several studies reporting a lack of established protocols staff in some studies commented on hoping that their organisations would learn from these experiences and be better prepared in the future workers wanted their hard work and sacrifices to be recognised by their organisations although the degree to which they expected to be additionally rewarded varied nevertheless they expected a degree of support in return for the sacrifices they made that not all felt was met for example guimard et al 1999 commenting on a focus group discussion amongst nurses write it was revealed during discussions that most of the nurses who volunteered to care for ebola patients were very disappointed about the recognition they received for their actions most of them felt abandoned by the managers of the hospital and felt they received insufficient financial and psychologic support during the epidemic the medias portrayal of the pandemic had both positive and negative impacts some studies described the role of the media in perpetuating stigma al knawy et al 2019 writing about mers in saudi arabia commented many healthcare workers felt that catastrophic portrayals of the pandemic on the news compounded families concerns such representations were also argued to be partly responsible for discouraging people to attend hospitals for other health concerns to the detriment of public health and with financial repercussions for hospital departments the media however was often a source of information which healthcare workers found helpful especially when they felt they were not party to information from their organisations the media was also noted to be helpful in advocating for healthcare workers and mobilising resources such as exerting pressure to provide more ppe the support of the wider public was considered vital and where the public did not comply with related directives this caused the healthcare workers anxiety and frustration bergeron et al 2006 quoted one nurse from their study of sars in canada my experience in the workplace regarding lack of compliance from clients in quarantine orders also makes me angry and afraid i feel that even after all the work of all health care professionals this issue may be impossible to be contained without support of the public healthcare workers also sought recognition and validation from the public they wanted the public to know what they had been through and how they had put their own lives at risk to help protect others gershon et al 2016  a pervasive narrative amongst the healthcare workers across all the pandemics was that of uncertainty which precipitated and perpetuated fear and anxiety knowledge was key in decreasing uncertainty and many participants sought information clarity and consensus with the purpose of achieving greater certainty communication was vital to the healthcare workers however not always experienced as helpful many reported  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

medrxiv preprint inconsistent and ineffective messaging and a lack consensus between sources of information ives et al 2009 for example report a lack of communication in their study of healthcare workers in the uk the majority of participants said they had been given neither information about pandemic influenza nor been made aware of what would be expected of them during such a crisis and this gave many the impression that their employing trust did not care about them or take their needs seriously equally prevalent were comments about there being too much information rapidly changing and inconsistent information increased frustration and uncertainty  this resulted in confusion and lack of trust in the information received and subsequently dismissal of the information as clinicians were unable to assimilate the information in the limited time they had broom et al 2017  communication was valued when it was centralised and co-ordinated and came from reliable authorities participants also valued leaders who were available and visible during the crisis how information was shared was also an important point with healthcare workers pointing out that many staff did not have the time or access to be repeatedly checking emails clearly visible posters and information cascaded through team leaders at shift handovers were cited as helpful healthcare workers also believed that communication is a two-way process and that their feedback and knowledge should be recognised and acted upon they felt they should be consulted and involved in decision making and that their learning from doing this work on the frontline was vital for responding to the current as well as future pandemics healthcare workers experiences of training were variable for many training imparted important information allayed anxiety and facilitated greater confidence participants in the studies valued training in infection control procedures and safe use of ppe as well as more general training about the virus participants in several studies however felt that they had not received adequate training as one healthcare worker in gershon et als 2016 study of ebola in west africa described they the sponsoring agency handed me a viral haemorrhagic fever guide i read it on the plane showed up but i had no real idea of what i was doing even though some participants described feeling unprepared there was a sense in some studies of limited or superficial engagement with training training seemed better received when it was deemed as relevant realistic and timely practical simulations increased workers confidence workers also highlighted the importance of learning through experience and commented on competence and confidence increasing over time the psychological impact on healthcare workers was acknowledged in many papers however few studies reported on workers experiences of any formal psychological interventions the idea that mental health support would be available seemed to be important and helped to alleviate workers anxiety for example yin and zeng 2020 quoted one nurse in the early phase of the covid-19 outbreak in china when psychological support services were mentioned they seemed to be of most value when available on site were flexible and informal and were offered individually or in small group which fitted around the workers shifts workshops on coping and emotional support were also described positively in some studies some participants appreciated the availability of helplines although others described these as too impersonal even when formal support was available some staff were ambivalent about engaging chen et al 2020 in their commentary on medical staff in china in the early stages covid-19 described the implementation of psychological intervention services encountered obstacles as medical staff were reluctant to participate in the group or individual psychology interventions provided to them moreover individual nurses showed excitability irritability unwillingness to rest and signs of psychological distress but refused any psychological help and stated that they did not have any problems  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 23 2020  after the peak of the pandemic the emotional impact of the work appeared to be acknowledged more workers in several papers were noted to report difficulties sleeping experiencing invasive memories and ongoing hyperarousal as well as struggling to adjust to being back at home and their normal work few described access to any kind of formal follow up although when this was offered this appeared to be appreciated even amongst those who described coping well and who did not want to engage with formal services informal follow ups and check ins from their organisations and colleagues were valued after deployment they stressed the need for mental health and psychosocial support and they requested deeper knowledge about coping strategies the respondents reported being focused on their duties and safety during deployment and only allowing emotional reactions afterwards von strauss et al 2017  in this review we sought to better understand healthcare workers experiences of working on the frontline and their views about support during covid-19 and comparable pandemics we found 40 qualitative papers which met our inclusion criteria and which covered a number of different pandemics over the past 20 years metasynthesis revealed eight key themes which transcended temporal and geographical boundaries participants across all the studies were deeply concerned about their own andor others physical safety this was greatest in the early phases of pandemics and exacerbated by inadequate ppe insufficient resources and inconsistent information workers struggled with high workloads and long shifts and desired adequate rest and recovery many experienced stigma healthcare workers relationships with families colleagues organisations the media and the wider public were complicated and nuanced and could be experienced concomitantly as sources of support but also sources of stress the results of this review show that the current experiences of frontline healthcare workers are not without precedent the themes identified in this review from previous pandemics are remarkably resonant with what we are hearing about the impact of covid-19 on healthcare workers across the world at the current time this points to a potential mental health impact on staff that is comparable to that experienced in previous pandemics a recently published review and meta-analysis of the mental health impact of working on pandemics including sars mers ebola and covid-19 kisely et al 2020 suggested that healthcare workers exposed to virusrelated work are 17 times more likely to develop psychological distress and ptsd compared to non-exposed workers our review sheds light on potential risk factors and their mechanisms of effect including fear associated with threat to life uncertainty due to inconsistent or rapidly changing information and threat to integrity due to discrimination this review also shows that accessing social support a previously well-established protective factor against mental health difficulties such as ptsd brewin et al 2000  was complex workers often self-isolated to protect their loved ones did not disclose details of their work to them struggled to manage the competing demands of work and family life and felt like the people in their usual support systems could not relate to what they had been through this compromised healthcare workers use of social support which may potentially have a longer-term adverse impact on their mental wellbeing the ethical moral and professional dilemmas that healthcare workers faced also increases their risk of moral injury moral injury has been defined as the psychological distress caused by actions or inactions which violate an individuals moral code or a sense of betrayal by others and has been highlighted as a potentially significant concern for healthcare workers during covid-19 greenberg  tracy 2000  the healthcare workers in this review were often unable to deliver the level of care they felt professional and morally obliged to provide and many felt betrayed by their colleagues organisations and society moral injury is not in itself a mental health disorder but is a risk factor for further mental health problems and may be particularly pernicious in the context of a pandemic the results of this review also highlight potential protective factors healthcare workers valued clear consistent and compassionate communication they engaged well with training when it was practical and specific the felt valued by their organisations when they prioritised their safety and supported them with manageable workloads and time out from work the wanted to be consulted and included in decision-making staff appreciated peer support and tended to seek emotional guidance from their colleagues this draws attention to potential opportunities to further develop peer support systems and increase mental health awareness in the workplace however colleagues could also be a source of tension so peer support interventions in this workforce warrant careful evaluation we also need to carefully consider how peer-based interventions may work in such a crisis so as not to place an additional burden on the healthcare workers providing them when by definition they are going through the same stressors this review also demonstrates that psychological growth was possible most healthcare workers were inherently motivated to undertake this work due to a sense of professional duty many derived meaning and satisfaction from their work and reported learning and professional development they also frequently reported strong team cohesiveness and camaraderie as suggested by gerada 2020 in a recent editorial comment some good must come out of covid-19 and there is potential for greater recognition and appreciation of healthcare work public attitudes and the media had both positive and negative impacts on the healthcare workers in these studies but have the potential to provide support and validation of their work nonetheless gestures of solidarity such as applause for healthcare workers which have been taking place around the world during covid-19 have the potential to feel meaningless and hypocritical if support for healthcare workers from the public and government is not sustained after the pandemic one potential difference between previews pandemics and covid-19 is that there is now greater acknowledgement of the mental health impact on healthcare workers and increasing recognition of the need to support their wellbeing billings et al 2020  however there is a yet little evidence about what is effective and what healthcare workers themselves want the studies included in this review focused little on formal psychological interventions it is therefore difficult to establish whether this was not of primary importance to the healthcare workers whether they were not aware of sources of mental health support or whether these interventions were simply not available to them when mental health support was mentioned participants tended to speak of it as desirable however some studies suggested a reluctance to engage this is perhaps indicative of potentially enduring stigma amongst healthcare workers exacerbated by militaristic metaphors and heroic narratives in the media which make it harder for them to admit when they are struggling this is an additional area that warrants exploration in order to better understand workers ambivalence and to ensure that they feel able to engage with appropriate mental health support when needed the results of this review also suggest that healthcare workers mental health needs change over time in the early stages of the crises the workers prioritised more basic human needs such as physical safety and rest at the peak workers seemed to focus on the work at hand and rely on colleagues for support after the crisis had passed there seemed to be greater recognition of the impact of working on the pandemic on mental health and an associated recognition of need for more support at the current time whilst attention is being paid to the impact on frontline healthcare workers mental health there is a paucity of research into psychosocial interventions specifically for frontline healthcare workers and what works for whom and when we also know that the healthcare workforce was experiencing high levels of distress and disaffection prior to covid-19 so we need to consider what should be set up as standard support for healthcare workers in the longer term this will be particularly important if there are further waves of covid-19 but also in the face of other inevitable future healthcare crises we need to ensure that we maintain a psychologically healthy workforce not just for the wellbeing of the workers but also for the sustainability of healthcare services globally the findings of this review highlight a number of important implications which are relevant globally provision of adequate safety equipment is a priority to enable safe and effective working but also to mitigate negative mental health outcomes workloads need to be manageable and sufficient periods of rest and recovery mandated to mitigate fatigue and burnout training should be relevant practical and timely learning on the job is valued alongside formal training communication needs to be clear and consistent and decision making shared leaders should be accessible and visible mechanisms to facilitate staff peer support should be put in place including ringfenced time and mental health awareness training competing demands between work and family life should be acknowledged and staff supported in maintaining family roles as much as possible staff should be supported in taking time off from work anxiety guilt and moral injury may be mitigated by reducing lone working encouraging buddying systems facilitating ethical forums which allow workers to discuss difficult decisions and focusing on the meaningfulness of the work mental health follow-up will be imperative for the early detection and treatment of emerging mental health problems and to ensure staff feel supported by their organisations ongoing peer support is likely to be important this review should be considered within the context of its strengths and limitations this paper offers a rapid review of an important body of literature for the purposes of providing urgent feedback and guidance for those planning the support of frontline healthcare workers during the current covid-19 crisis we conducted our search across three databases and used two independent reviewers for searching screening data extraction and quality appraisal we conducted a meta-synthesis for the reader to highlight overarching themes in relation to healthcare workers experiences of working on the frontline during a pandemic and their views about support there are a number of limitations inherent in the papers included this review has highlighted a dearth of research exploring healthcare workers own views needs and preferences what research there is has focused predominantly on doctors and nurses with little or no identified research on other key frontline healthcare groups including physiotherapists pharmacists receptionists porters or cleaners most of the studies were of only moderate-quality therefore caution must be observed when considering the transferability of the findings there are also some limitations of the current review due to the rapidity required we did not pre-register a study protocol on prospero we also only searched a limited number of databases therefore some papers may have been missed which may have provided more detail or contradicted the findings summarised here while research from across the world was included in this review we were only able to include studies published in english this review may therefore be subject to some publication bias ongoing attention is warranted as papers reporting on this phenomenon may yet be published this pandemic is not unprecedented we have an opportunity to learn from the lessons of previous pandemics and provide better support for frontline healthcare workers more high-quality qualitative research is urgently needed in order to better understand the experiences needs and preferences of the healthcare workforce particularly those frontline healthcare workers whose voices have not yet been adequately represented we need to develop clinical guidance specific to supporting this workforce this guidance should be developed in consultation and collaboration with the healthcare workers themselves interventions to prevent and treat mental health distress in healthcare workers need to be developed and their timing effectiveness and acceptability carefully evaluated we have an opportunity to mitigate the negative mental health impact of covid-19 and support the longer-term wellbeing of the healthcare workforce across the world this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-forprofit sectors

to most tony liu jonah meyerhoff david mohr c lyle ungar h konrad kording p  the covid-19 outbreak has clear clinical 1 and economic 2 impacts but also affects behaviors eg through social distancing 3  and may increase stress and anxiety however while case numbers are tracked daily 4  we know little about the psychological effects of the outbreak on individuals in the moment here we examine the psychological and behavioral shifts over the initial stages of the outbreak in the united states in an observational longitudinal study through gps phone data we find that homestay is increasing while being at work dropped precipitously using regular real-time experiential surveys we observe an overall increase in stress and mood levels which is similar in size to the weekend vs weekday differences as there is a significant difference between weekday and weekend mood and stress levels this is an important decrease in wellbeing for some especially those affected by job loss the mental health impact is severe  the ongoing covid-19 outbreak has become a global crisis not just because of rising infection and death rates but also because of the behavioral changes it necessitates even those who are not directly affected by the disease have seen their lives disrupted through mandated social distancing measures these sudden changes can impact an individuals mental wellbeing reduced social connections is linked to depression 5  while physical restrictions of quarantine can also have negative psychological effects 6  in addition to the outbreaks clinical and economic impact we also need to understand these mental wellness and behavioral changes in order to combat the disease both wellbeing and behavior can be measured digitally such as through online surveys 7  or location and survey data collected by phone sensors 8 9  there has already been work examining the spread of covid-19 in china using mobility data from the social media platform tencent 10 as well as work measuring mental health-related effects of the outbreak through crosssectional web surveys 11 12  however only ecological momentary assessments emas allow us to understand how the situation affects the way we feel in the moment in this article we explore how people are changing their behavior in the first weeks of the pandemic and the nature of the associated changes in wellbeing and psychological distress as measured with emas we use data on 127 us adult participants table 1 from an ongoing longitudinal study where they completed baseline assessments of their mental wellbeing and installed a personal

through job loss show worsening of depressive symptoms seven individuals reported job loss during the post-social distancing study week and all seven also reported an increase in their depression severity median increase of 3 points the probability of that happening by chance is 1128 table 3  these results are consistent with other findings 15 that show the direct impact of the virus on mental wellbeing through income instability is severe we did not see evidence of significant worsening in depression at a population level in the first weeks following the national declaration of emergency and social distancing guidelines we did see significant increases in mood and stress however these were small at a population level the stress and mood impact of the outbreak is comparable to every day being a weekday our results suggest a significant increase in depressive symptom severity for those affected by job loss though our findings are not consistent with the kind of massive mental health crisis at a population level that some in the media speculate them to be our data do suggest that the mental health consequences are likely concentrated in groups that have been substantially

can be appropriately allocated for the crisis it is important to note the sampling limitations of our study our participants are recruited from a research panel and are not wholly representative of national demographics in particular our sample over-represents females and individuals with previously diagnosed depression table   1  we also note that our analysis is based on completed emas for each individual and does not account for missed surveys the survey response rate dropped in the week post declaration of emergency compared to previous weeks 75 response rate to 65 response rate so it is possible that the participants most affected by the crisis are self-censoring 16  furthermore as we only look at short-term effects of the coronavirus crisis these findings may change as time goes on we will continue monitoring the longer-term response to the crisis and will report on trends as they emerge although it remains to be seen how individuals respond as the coronavirus crisis progresses these findings suggest that at the population level and on a short time scale the covid-19 pandemic has increased stress levels widely but has not had a uniform impact on mental health

ultrasound establishments during the covid 19 pandemic ashok khurana k sharma aparna sumitra bachani gaurika sahi reema bhatt kumar bimal sahani mohit shah v sunil mehta krishna gopal t praveen l   the international society of ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology isuog has recently published guidance on the use of personal protective equipment ppe and other methods to reduce the hazard of sars-cov-2 infection for clinicians and sonographers undertaking ultrasound examinations 1 2 the documents however clearly state that guidance in relation to ppe differs from country to country and region to region and that local guidance should be followed when this is available this document attempts to fill that space in the context of heterogeneity and varied education level economic status and cultural beliefs and practices in india as in the isuog document it is emphasized at the outset that many of the measures suggested in this document are based on limited research and evidence this advice is drawn from various sources available from china 3 4 hong kong 5 singapore 6 uk 7 8 canada 9 continental europe 1013 the usa 14 15 and the who 16 it is a list of recommended practices that are so far believed to be the most effective methods for reducing the transmission of sars-cov-2 between patients and healthcare providers 
respiratory droplets from coughing sneezing loud conversation and direct contact are responsible for the spread of sars-cov-2 this happens when body fluids touch another persons eyes nose or mouth or an incision laceration or abrasion the disease caused by the virus has been named covid19evidence suggests that healthcare workers must use appropriate ppe even if they remain further than 1 m away from a symptomatic patient 17it is very much possible that carriers may be asymptomatic it would be prudent therefore to presume that every patient and attendant is a potential source of infectionprecautions need to extend way beyond the lockdown period and cannot stop even if the incidence curve of covid19 flattens or fallsprecautions tact knowledge and security measures will be put to test as soon as the lockdown is lifted there will be a massive patient overload and being prepared is the only answer in this situationthis document is a guidance note and not a compulsory protocol every institutionclinic can have a modified protocol to enhance protectionan institutionclinic can opt to remain closed for services as long as the regional law does not enforce the essential services maintenance act

handling of transducers machine desktops keyboards touch screens trackballs and recording devices considering the inevitable reduction in resources and capacity which limits the number of scan appointments available based on isuog guidelines it is recommended that appointments should be triaged to one of the three categories as shown in fig 1 the following indications may be considereddating scans between 6 and 10 weeks should be postponed and dating should be done at the early morphology 1113 weeks 6 days scan windowpatients with bleeding per vaginum or pain need appointment prioritization bleeding score can be assessed based on pictorial graphs soakage of 3 pads in an hour would designate as a score of 3the anomalies scan at 1820 weeks may be delayed by a few weeks even under pandemic circumstances it is likely that a patient will be able to obtain permission from a district court along with a medical board opinion for delayed termination in case of a majorlethal anomalysecond trimester scans should be given priority over first trimester scansroutine growth and doppler scans should be postponed to a 36 weeks assessment if the pandemic recedes these can be rescheduled earlierdecision making growth and doppler scans between 28 and 41 weeks should be considered on priority information from this scan dictates time place and mode of delivery and this decision may be critical to save lives of mothers and fetusesthe 36 weeks growth and doppler scan is a useful triaging tool for early delivery decisions and may need to be carried out although figo recommends clinical assessment and delivery during a pandemicthe above-mentioned prioritization will need to be modified depending on extension of lockdown this aspect is critical for the safety of patients physicians and clinic staff adherence to these suggestions will ensure social distancing advance scheduling is necessary and walk in patients are to be discouraged this should be carried out on the phone by experienced staff the gap between appointments will vary from institution to institution and should be based onstaff numbersavailability of waiting spacesavailability of scanning roomstype of scanturn around time from arrival of patient to exit this should ideally be carried out on the phone at the time of scheduling an appointment or else when the patient arrives at the clinic for hospital walk-ins the latter option becomes even more important and must be followed at the time of patient arrival recording the temperature is an ideal screen but cumbersome and impractical handheld non-contact forehead thermometers are in short supply and patients are using paracetamol and not always being truthful a history of travel occupation contact and cluster tocc is recommended 1 experienced staff should be deputed to handle this and a formal form may be used appendix 2travel should include a detailed itinerary transit locations and date of returnoccupation should be asked as a direct questiona history of exposure to a test positive case should be directly asked fora history of living in a known positive cluster or visiting such a cluster should be noteda properly filled declaration and written informed consent document should be obtained from the patient appendix 2 patients can then be triaged into one of the three categories 1 as shown in fig 2 based on this categorization the ppe should be utilized as shown in table 1 patients identified to be at risk for sars-cov-2 infection should delay their ultrasound assessment by 14 days if urgent scan is required they should be referred to the designated centres for the needy informed written consent should be taken from the woman explicitly stating that she understands that there is a risk of her getting infected by visiting any place during this pandemic and that she also knows that the ultrasound scan needs to be done at this stage appendix 2 the following recommendations apply to sanitation 1 13 1820 and logistics the who 16 21 and ministry of health and family welfare government of india recommendations 18 are particularly useful in this regardphysical barriers such as glass or plastic windows panels should be used to reduce exposure to the covid19 virus this approach can be implemented in areas where patients will first present triage areas the registration desk at the clinic or the emergency departmentguards at the gate should wear surgical masks and maintain hand hygiene conversation should be carried out from a distance of at least 1 m 21alternate seats can be strapped down the middle with string or tape to ensure distance seatingwaiting in a vehicle is safer than waiting in a clinicevery ultrasound environment is different 1 it is unlikely that ultrasound clinics have too many choices in ventilationair conditioning it is recommended that single unit air conditioning should be run in an open to outside air mode vent open clinics will have to decide individually how best to facilitate maximum air change in routine practice aerosol generating procedures agp are rare in daily ultrasound practice and should be handled by standard operating procedures by various guidelines 1 2 however such agps should not be attempted in an ultrasound clinic but in designated centersall indoor areas such as entrance lobbies corridors and staircases escalators elevators security guard booths office rooms meeting rooms pantries and cafeteria should be mopped with a 1 sodium hypochlorite solution or phenolic disinfectants annexure 1 shows details of how to prepare a 1 sodium hypochlorite solution and has been issued by the ministry of health and family welfare government of india 18 phenolic compounds are available as readymade house detergent products in the indian market the frequency of mopping will depend on the footfall at 23 patients an hour 2 h mopping is recommended mopping should also precede the start of work and should also be done after the last patient has departed cleaning should be started from cleaner areas and then proceed to dirtier areas cleaning staff must wear surgical masks and heavy-duty gloves goggles are required only if there is risk of chemical or organic splash who rational and appropriate use of ppe appropriate hand hygiene should be practicedhigh contact surfaces such elevator buttons

toilet soap dispensers should be cleaned with 1 sodium hypochlorite or a phenolic detergent three to four times a day taps and metallic surfaces should be cleaned with a sanitiser containing 6070 alcoholoutdoor areas have less risk than indoor areas because of air currents and exposure to sunlight cleaning and disinfection efforts should be targeted to frequently touched surfaces such as tables and bench handlespatient examination tables must be covered with sheets and pillow covers if necessary that must be changed after each patient linen may be disposable as per individual choice routine machine-washing with a regular detergent is adequate for non-disposable sheets and pillow covers mattresses and table edges must be sanitised using a sanitiser containing 6070 alcohol if

gastrointestinal health of dogs and
cats1 j suchodolski s   the gastrointestinal gi microbiota is a complex collection of microorganisms
ie bacteria archaea fungi protozoa and viruses recent molecular phylogenetic
studies typically based on comparative 16s rrna gene analysis have revealed that the gi
tract of mammals harbors several hundred to thousand bacterial phylotypes frank et al 2007 suchodolski et al 2009 handl et al
2011 it is estimated that the intestine of mammals contains approximately
1010 to 1014 microorganisms about 10 times more than the number of
cells composing the host body this mutually interacting system composed of the host cells
and the resident microbes is called the intestinal microbiome gut microbes play a crucial
role in host health they act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens aid in
digestion and energy harvest from the diet provide nutritional support for enterocytes and
stimulate the development of the immune system molecular approaches have improved our
understanding about the composition the dynamics and the functionality of the intestinal
ecosystem in dogs and cats ritchie et al 2008
desai et al 2009 swanson et al 2010 the composition of the intestinal microbiota can be
influenced to some extent by exogenous factors such as diet simpson et al 2002 barry et al
2010 middelbos et al 2010 however the
microbiota is resilient to most environmental influences returning rapidly to its
pretreatment state antibiotic administration leads to more profound alterations in the
intestinal microbiome with some bacterial groups remaining depressed for several weeks to
months dethlefsen et al 2008 suchodolski et al 2009 grnvold et al 2010 during the last few years convincing evidence has emerged
implicating alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota to chronic
enteropathies not only in humans but also in dogs and cats german et al 2003 inness et al 2007
janeczko et al 2008 craven et al 2010a suchodolski et al
2010 in addition extraintestinal disorders eg atopy in infants have been
due to the interactions of intestinal microbiota with the host immune system associated
with gi dysbiosis penders et al 2007 these
findings emphasize the importance of maintaining a balanced intestinal ecosystem this
article will summarize recent work characterizing the intestinal microbiome of healthy cats
and dogs and alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and innate immune
system that have been identified in dogs and cats with chronic enteropathies traditional cultivation techniques have commonly been used to characterize the composition
of the canine and feline intestinal microbiota benno et al
1992 johnston et al 1993 mentula et al 2005 bacterial culture is useful for
the detection of specific intestinal pathogens eg salmonella spp
allowing for antibiotic susceptibility testing and genotyping of cultured isolates however
it is now well established that culture-dependent methods are not well suited for in-depth
characterization of complex environments such as the mammalian gi tract limitations of
cultivation methods include our inability to culture and correctly classify the vast
majority of intestinal microbes greetham et al
2002 molecular tools have now become the standard approach in microbial ecology
figure 1 and are now increasingly used for
characterization of the intestinal microbiome of dogs and cats suchodolski et al 2005 desai et al
2009 lubbs et al 2009 vester et al 2009 these molecular methods have been
reviewed in detail elsewhere tannock 2005 because of anatomical and physiological differences each intestinal compartment harbors a
unique microbial ecosystem suchodolski et al
2005 microorganisms reside in specialized niches and provide specialized functions
by utilizing host nutrients and in return provide metabolites for host uptake table 1 each dog and cat harbors a very unique and
individual microbial profile suchodolski et al
2004 ritchie et al 2010 the major
individual differences occur on a bacterial species and strain level with typically only
minor overlap of bacterial species between individual animals a recent study has shown that
84 of cats evaluated harbored bifidobacterium spp ritchie et al 2010 however only a minor percentage of cats harbored
the same species of bifidobacteria differences in bacterial composition between dogs and
cats have been suggested johnston et al 1993
johnston 1999 new molecular studies indicate
that such differences manifest themselves on a bacterial species and strain level as most
mammals share similar bacterial phyla and genera ley et
al 2008 differences exist also in composition and in total bacterial numbers in the different
compartments of the gi tract table 2 total
bacterial counts and species richness increase along the gi tract and vary also between the
intestinal lumen and the mucosa mentula et al
2005 the stomach harbors between 101 and 106 cfug of
bacteria bacterial counts in the duodenum and jejunum are typically small 105
cfuml of content but can reach up to 109 cfuml in some dogs and cats johnston 1999 this is considerably greater than found
in the duodenum of humans where total bacterial counts 105 cfug have been
associated with the clinical syndrome small intestinal bacterial overgrowth cats appear to
have greater counts of anaerobic bacteria in their small intestine compared with dogs johnston et al 1993 the distal small intestine ie
ileum contains a more diverse microbiota and greater bacterial numbers 107
cfuml bacterial counts in the colon range between 109 and 1011
cfug of content benno et al 1992 mentula et al 2005 bacteroides
clostridium lactobacillus
bifidobacterium spp and enterobacteriaceae are the predominant
bacterial groups that have been cultured from the canine and feline intestine table 2 molecular tools have greatly expanded our knowledge about the phylogenetic diversity within
the canine and feline gut recent studies have revealed several hundred bacterial phylotypes
in the canine intestinal tract suchodolski et al
2009 swanson et al 2010 the phyla
firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria fusobacteria and actinobacteria constitute more
than 99 of all gut microbiota in dogs and cats the remaining bacterial groups are
represented by the phyla spirochaetes tenericutes verrucomicrobia cyanobacteria
chloroflexi and a few unclassified bacterial lineages generally aerobic bacteria or
facultative anaerobic bacteria occur in greater abundance in the small intestine whereas
anaerobes predominate in the large intestine in the stomach mucosa-adherent
helicobacter spp predominate followed by lactobacillus
and streptococcus spp and clostridia spp whereas the
vast majority of cats and dogs harbor various helicobacter spp in their
stomach helicobacter pylori the clinically most important
helicobacter species in humans has not been isolated from pet dogs or
cats rossi et al 2008 the proximal small
intestine harbors approximately 10 different bacterial phyla with clostridia
lactobacillales and proteobacteria being most abundant suchodolski et al 2009 proteobacteria and spirochaetes are more abundant in
the proximal gi tract and typically represent 1 of obtained sequences in the large
intestine of healthy animals firmicutes bacteroides and fusobacteria
appear to be the predominant bacterial groups in the large intestine however the reported
abundance of these bacterial groups differs between studies for example percentages of
firmicutes range between 25 and 95 of obtained sequencing tags middelbos et al 2010 ritchie et al
2010 swanson et al 2010 handl et al 2011 it is likely that these
discrepancies may be due to differences in dna extraction methods and pcr protocols between
studies actinobacteria were identified as highly abundant in fecal samples using
comparative chaperonin 60 gene sequence analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization
inness et al 2007 desai et al 2009 jia et al
2010 this is not surprising because it has been shown that 16s rrna gene
approaches with universal bacterial primers typically underestimate actinobacteria ritchie et al 2010 bifidobacteria members of the
actinobacteria appear to be less abundant in cats and dogs compared with humans inness et al 2007 jia
et al 2010 the firmicutes are a heterogeneous bacterial phylum comprising several distinct
phylogenetically clostridium clusters these clusters differ in abundance
along the intestinal tract clusters xiva and iv encompass many important short-chain fatty
acids scfa producing bacteria eg ruminococcus spp
faecalibacterium spp dorea spp and
turicibacter spp and predominate in the ileum and colon cluster xi and
cluster i clostridium perfringens-group are the second most abundant
group in the small and large intestine of dogs and cats ritchie et al 2008 suchodolski et al
2008a several studies have described the metabolic products generated by the canine and feline
intestinal microbiota including vfa lactate ammonia and other end products sunvold et al 1995 sparkes et al 1998 thompson et al
1998 of significance for gi health is the ability of intestinal microbes to ferment
dietary products into scfa topping and clifton
2001 of those acetate propionate and butyrate are most abundant constituting
approximately 60 25 and 10 respectively of vfa in the canine and feline fecal samples
sunvold et al 1995 barry et al 2010 minor components of the vfa are branched-chain fatty
acids including isobutyric acid butyric acid and isovaleric acid which are formed during
protein degradation macfarlane and macfarlane 2003
barry et al 2010 although marked differences in the phylogenetic composition of the intestinal microbiota
have been observed between individual animals of the same animal species the metabolic end
products are typically quite similar between individuals recent metagenomics studies have
revealed that despite phylogenetic differences individuals share a wide array of microbial
genes indicating that the human intestine harbors a core microbiome turnbaugh et al 2009 furthermore it is suggested that a functional
redundancy exists in the gi tract several members of the community are able to perform
similar functions and if one microbial group is displaced because of perturbations eg
antibiotic therapy other members of the community are capable of maintaining a stable
ecosystem function dethlefsen et al 2008 suchodolski et al 2009 the core microbiome has not
been well defined in dogs and cats the mammalian gi tract harbors complex communities of fungi archaea protozoa and
viruses recent molecular studies have provided more in-depth analysis about the diversity
of these microorganisms in healthy animals but their interactions their influences on the
host and their role in gi disease remain unclear cultivation studies have reported yeasts
and molds in the intestine of approximately 25 healthy beagle dogs davis et al 1977 mentula et al
2005 molecular tools have revealed fungi in the small intestine of 76 of the
dogs evaluated suchodolski et al 2008b a recent
metagenomic approach estimated the abundance of fungi in canine fecal samples as 01 of
total microbiota swanson et al 2010 archaea are single-celled microorganisms and are evolutionary distinct from bacteria and
eukaryotes archaea are commensals in the intestine of ruminants and have recently been
described in the human and canine intestine with methanobacteriales most commonly reported
representing approximately 1 of total microbioal sequencing tags swanson et al 2010 reported viruses in the gi tract of dogs and cats are limited to a few families such as
rotavirus coronavirus and parvovirus kempf et al
2010 new metagenomic studies revealed a highly diverse viral community in the
canine intestine composed of several hundred double-stranded dna viruses with the vast
majority classified as bacteriophages swanson et al
2010 future studies will need to evaluate the prevalence and abundance of
single-stranded dna and rna viruses in the canine and feline gi tract a balanced intestinal ecosystem primes and stimulates the immune system aids in the
defense against invading intestinal pathogens and provides nutritional benefits to the
host although animals can be raised under germ-free conditions several morphological and
immunological differences between germ-free and conventionally raised animals indicate that
commensal microbes contribute significantly to the development and maintenance of gut
structure for example germ-free rodents have an altered epithelial architecture eg
thinner lamina propria reduced number of peyers patches and lymphoid follicles and have
a reduced turnover time of epithelial cells hooper et al
2001 dogs raised germ-free show similar growth rates as conventionally raised
dogs but they demonstrate an underdeveloped lymphoid system and have decreased
immunoglobulin concentrations cohn and heneghan
1991 however germ-free dogs are capable of mounting an adequate immune response
to antigenic stimulation wound healing and blood-clotting mechanisms in germ-free-raised
dogs are similar as in conventionally raised animals cohn
and heneghan 1991 the intestine of germ-free dogs is characterized by thinner
villi and a reduction in both the lamina propria and mucosal surface area thompson and trexler 1971 interestingly surgically
induced strangulation obstruction of the small intestine and surgically induced bile
peritonitis did not lead to death in germ-free-raised dogs whereas conventionally raised
dogs showed 100 mortality emphasizing the role of intestinal bacteria for the severity of
the disease cohn and heneghan 1991 the resident microbiota is an integral part of the intestinal barrier which protects the
host from invading pathogens a mechanism termed colonization resistance the proposed
mechanisms include the competition for oxygen nutrients mucosal adhesion sites and the
creation of a physiologically restrictive environment for nonresident bacterial species
eg secretion of antimicrobials alterations in gut ph production of hydrogen sulfide
kanauchi et al 2005 therefore young dogs and
cats with colonization resistance not yet fully established are typically more susceptible
to invading pathogens eg campylobacterjejuni the
sterile gi tract of newborn puppies and kittens is colonized within hours after birth by
bacteria present in the birth canal and surrounding environment after 24 h aerobic and
anaerobic counts exceed 108 cfug of intestinal content buddington 2003 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are at similar numbers
in the first weeks after birth but the proportions of anaerobes are greater during
adulthood buddington 2003 the presence of
intestinal bacteria in early life is necessary to establish oral tolerance to commensal
bacteria and food antigens to prevent onset of an inappropriate immune response which may
lead to chronic gi inflammation bauer et al 2006
microbes interact and stimulate the immune host system as has been shown by administration
of specific bacterial strains as probiotics in dogs and cats for example administration of
lactobacillus acidophilus dsm13241 increased granulocyte phagocytic
activity marshall-jones et al 2006 growing
puppies that received enterococcus faecium sf68 for 20 wk showed increased
plasma iga concentrations compared with the control group benyacoub et al 2003 the majority of colonic bacteria are anaerobes and their main functions are to produce
energy from food and to help in the competitive exclusion of potentially pathogenic
bacteria the slower flow of ingesta and the increased time and availability of nutrients
favors the microbial diversity in the colon bacteria within the ecosystem have developed
cooperative strategies to transform the complexity of nutrients for their own benefit as
well as that of the host colonic bacteria provide digestive enzymes that allow the
utilization of complex carbohydrates microbes metabolize sloughed epithelial cells
endogenous mucus and nondigested substrates that have passed through the small intestine
the latter are predominantly complex carbohydrates including starch and dietary fiber such
as cellulose pectin and fructans topping and clifton
2001 the fermentation of these substrates results in the production of scfa
eg acetate propionate and butyrate that provide the energy for bacterial metabolism
but also for epithelial cell growth sunvold et al
1995 up to 7 of the metabolic energy of dogs and to a lesser extent in cats is
produced by microbial fermentation in the colon herschel et
al 1981 brosey et al 2000 the fecal
concentrations of microbial metabolic products can be modified through dietary modulation
such as varying protein or fiber content eg through prebiotic supplementation in the
diet huurinainen 2009 barry et al 2010 normal intestinal motility is a major defense mechanism against attachment of pathogenic
bacteria in the small intestine and subnormal intestinal motility has been associated with
small intestinal dysbiosis physiological concentrations of scfa stimulated intestinal
motility in the canine ileum emphasizing the importance of microbial fermentation products
on host health kamath et al 1987 in vitro
studies in dogs and cats revealed that physiological concentrations of scfa stimulate
contraction of longitudinal but not circular smooth muscles in the canine and feline colon
indicating that scfa may also contribute to in vivo colonic motility mcmanus et al 2002 rondeau et al
2003 however no effects of scfa on canine colonic motility were observed in in
vivo studies flourie et al 1989 it is obvious that the close relationship between the intestinal microbiota and host cells
will have a significant impact on gi health gastrointestinal disease may develop due to
colonization with transient pathogens due to an overgrowth by opportunistic resident
bacterial groups or due to an altered cross-talk between the intestinal innate immune
system and the commensal microbiota invasion with specific pathogens may profoundly disturb
the intestinal epithelium by altering the structure of the gi mucosa enteric pathogens can
penetrate into the submucosa and peyers patches or produce exo- or enterotoxins that alter
enterocyte function enterotoxins produced by pathogenic bacteria eg enterotoxigenic
clostridium perfringens and toxigenic clostridium
difficile can stimulate mucosal fluid secretions whereas villus effacement and
loss of surface area will diminish mucosal absorptive capacity resulting in diarrhea marks and kather 2003 a dysfunction of the mucosal
barrier can lead to an increase in intestinal permeability and clinically significant
bacterial translocation intestinal pathogens that have been associated with acute or
chronic diarrhea in dogs and cats include enterotoxigenic c perfringens
toxigenic c difficile salmonella escherichia
coli ie enteropathogenic enterotoxigenic enterohemorrhagic and
enteroinvasive and specific campylobacter spp ie
campylobacter jejuni olson and
sandstedt 1987 marks et al 2002 sancak et al 2004 several gi diseases of dogs and cats are associated with nonspecific alterations in the
intestinal microbiota small intestinal dysbiosis is a common disorder that is suspected to
be caused by an intestinal dysbiosis this disorder commonly has been referred to as small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea as it has been previously
suggested that affected dogs harbor increased bacterial counts ie 105
cfuml in their duodenum batt et al 1983
patients respond favorably to antibiotics eg tylosin but diarrhea usually returns
shortly after cessation of therapy westermarck et al
2005 recent studies found no correlation between increased duodenal bacterial
counts and disease status of dogs german et al
2003 failure of host control mechanisms that regulate bacterial counts in the
small intestine may lead to more general changes in bacterial populations causing a
dysbiosis in the small intestine these regulatory mechanisms include intestinal motility
and antimicrobial substances in pancreatic and biliary secretions therefore spontaneous
changes in gi motility or procedures that alter the architecture of the intestine eg
surgical creation of intestinal loops and resection of the ileocolic valve can predispose
animals to intestinal dysbiosis thompson et al
1998 in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency the defective pancreas is not capable
of secreting antimicrobial peptides and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is often
associated with an increase or compositional changes in small intestinal microbiota williams et al 1987 simpson et al 1990 these changes may lead to various mechanisms that
negatively affect the function of the gi tract examples are the dehydroxylation of fatty
acids leading to impaired fat absorption alterations in the intestinal barrier with
increased intestinal permeability the destruction of brush border enzymes and epithelial
carrier proteins and competition for substrates leading to nutrient and vitamin
malabsorption eg vitamin b12 rutgers et al
1993 1996 melgarejo et al 2000 there is emerging evidence implicating commensal intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis
of inflammatory bowel disease ibd in humans dogs and cats janeczko et al 2008 suchodolski et al 2010 the currently proposed pathogenic mechanism behind ibd
involves an abnormal interaction between commensal intestinal microbiota and the intestinal
immune system in genetically predisposed individuals packey
and sartor 2009 for example genome-wide association studies in humans with
crohns disease have revealed at least 33 susceptibility genes and many of these genes are
associated with a defective bacterial killing of the innate immune system eg
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2 also known as caspase
activation and recruitment domain 15 packey and sartor
2009 the microbiota is implicated in human ibd because inflammation is present in
gut compartments with the greatest bacterial counts studies in engineered animal models
with susceptibility for inflammation indicate that ibd develops only if bacteria are present
packey and sartor 2009 the cause-effect
relationship between microbial alterations and inflammation is not well determined it is
suspected that intestinal inflammation causes a dysbiosis toward gram-negative bacteria
ie proteobacteria and a depletion of commensal bacterial groups may lead to a reduced
capability of the intestinal microbiome to downregulate an aberrant intestinal immune
response leading to a perturbation of intestinal inflammation sokol et al 2008 new hypotheses indicate that campylobacter
jejuni and salmonella gastroenteritis trigger changes in mucosal
architecture and in the innate immune system which diminish the colonization resistance of
resident microbes stecher and hardt 2008 in human
ibd decreases in the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes and increases in proteobacteria
are commonly observed furthermore reductions in the diversity of
clostridium clusters xiva and iv ie ruminococcaceae
faecalibacterium prausnitzii and c coccoides
subgroups in ibd patients indicate that these bacterial groups important producers of
scfa play an important role in maintenance of gi health sokol et al 2008 packey and sartor
2009 recent molecular studies performed in dogs and cats have also revealed differences in the
intestinal microbiome between healthy animals and ibd patients table 3 dogs and cats with idiopathic small intestinal ibd were
significantly enriched in enterobacteriaceae compared with controls janeczko et al 2008 xenoulis et al
2008 two other studies revealed an increase in proteobacteria ie
pseudomonas spp in the duodenum of ibd dogs jergens et al 2010 suchodolski et al
2010 similar to humans ibd dogs showed a reduction in the proportions of
bacteroidales and clostridiales eg genus faecalibacterium
ruminococcus and dorea within the clostridium clusters
iv and xiva jergens et al 2010 reduced bacterial
species richness was identified in the small intestine of ibd dogs xenoulis et al 2008 craven et al
2009 compositional changes have also been observed in the large intestine of dogs
and cats with chronic enteropathies fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed
greater microscopic counts of total bacteria bifidobacterium spp and
bacteroides spp in healthy cats whereas cats with ibd had greater
microscopic counts of desulfovibrio spp potential producers of toxic
sulfides inness et al 2007 similar to humans studies have indicated that feline and canine ibd are likely associated
with an immune dysregulation as differential cytokine expressions have been identified in
dogs and cats with chronic enteropathies nguyen van et al
2006 janeczko et al 2008 luckschander et al 2010 several studies have
evaluated expression of toll-like receptors tlr in dogs with chronic
enteropathies toll-like receptors are crucial members of the innate immune system they are
located on cell surfaces recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns and activate
immune responses mucosal expression of tlr-2 tlr-4 and tlr-9 was increased in various dog
breeds with ibd burgener et al 2008 mcmahon et al 2010 german shepherd dogs are
predisposed to chronic enteropathies and a recent study has revealed an increased tlr-2 and
a decreased tlr-5 expression when compared with healthy greyhound dogs allenspach et al 2010 furthermore the microbiota of
affected german shepherd dogs differed from the control dogs and was enriched in
streptococcus and abiotrophia spp indicating a
potential interplay between resident microbiota and the innate immune system allenspach et al 2010 granulomatous colitis of boxer dogs sometimes also referred to as histiocytic ulcerative
colitis of boxer dogs has recently been associated with the presence of adherent and
invasive escherichia coli aiec simpson et al 2006 these aiec isolates share similarities to aiec
isolates obtained from ileal tissues of humans with crohns disease the inflammation
responds well to antimicrobial treatment and improvement of clinical signs correlates with
the intracellular clearance of bacteria craven et al
2010b because this disease occurs almost exclusively in boxer dogs a genetic
susceptibility has been hypothesized a recent genome-wide analysis of affected and
unaffected boxer dogs has identified snp in the gene encoding neutrophil cytosolic factor 2
a subunit of the nadph complex in phagocytes craven et al
2010b the defect in the nadph complex may result in an inability to eliminate
intracellular pathogens predisposing the host to chronic infections the use of molecular tools has vastly improved our understanding of the complexity and the
diversity of the intestinal microbiome of dogs and cats these methods have allowed us to
monitor and to understand microbial dynamics in response to various environmental influences
eg dietary changes antibiotic treatment and to identify bacterial groups that appear
to play a key role in maintaining homeostasis and balance of the intestinal ecosystem eg
members of the clostridium clusters xiva and iv these bacterial groups
are often depleted in intestinal inflammation furthermore recent studies have revealed
differential immune responses in dogs and cats with chronic enteropathies and have also
identified underlying genetic defects in the host innate immunity together these findings
clearly implicate an interaction of the innate immune system and commensal intestinal
microbiota in the pathogenesis of canine and feline enteropathies  qescalor quantitative elastic scaling framework in distributed streaming processing valeria krzhizhanovskaya v gbor zvodszky michael lees h jack dongarra j peter sloot m srgio brissos joo teixeira weimin mu zongze jin weilin zhu fan liu zhenzhen li ziyuan zhu weiping wang   recently the distributed stream processing systems dspss 14 offer a powerful means to extract the valuable information from the data streams in time we usually use the directed acyclic graph dag 5 to model the data stream processing application dspa in dspss in the dag each vertex represents a kind of operations named as the operator and each edge represents a data stream between two operators at the run time the dsps initiates a certain number of operator instances for each operator and deploy them on the run-time environment considering the constant fluctuating data stream we adopt the elastic scaling in the dspss which adjusts the number of the operators dynamically to satisfy the qos requirements there have been many researches on the elastic scaling zacheilas et al 6 adjusts the number of operators based on the state transition graph hidalgo et al 7 evaluates the processing power of the operator through the benchmarking and adjusts the number of the operator instances based on the threshold and the workload prediction wei et al 8 only adjusts the cpu frequency of the virtual machines as the workload fluctuates to reduce the energy cost marangozova-martin et al 9 presents the method to allocate three levels of resources to the operator instances including virtual machines processes and threads the above methods allocate the same amount of resources to the instances of the same operator but they ignore the correlation between the operator performance and resource provision actually the unreasonable resources provision for the operator instance will cause some severe problems for example over-provision will result in a waste of resources besides the under-provision means that the dspss will create a lot of instances to achieve high processing performance which results in the huge overhead of the scheduling and the state transition in this paper we present a quantitative elastic scaling framework named qescalor to allocate the resources for the operator instances quantitatively based on the actual performance requirements this framework firstly builds the operator performance and resource provision model oprpm then it generates the low-cost elastic scaling plan based on the oprpm the contributions of this paper are as followswe use the qescalor which first considers the correlation between the operator performance and resource provision to enhance the performance of the resource provisionwe propose an online algorithm named dsa it learns the correlation samples of the operator performance and resource provision based on the gradient strategy and re-sampling mechanism besides we use the random forest regression model rfr 10 to build the oprpm to get the suitable resource provision options for the operator performance requirementwe present a quantitative and cost-based elastic scaling algorithm qcesa it refers to the prediction of the workload 11 and the operator performance 12 to generate the low-cost scaling plan based on the oprpm to achieve the resource-efficient elastic scaling to improve the performancewe implement the qescalor as a key part of our datadock 11 the experiment results show that our qescalor can enhance the performance with the lower scaling cost on the real-world datasets
 we organize the rest of our paper as follows section 2 describes the design of qescalor section 3 shows the experimental results of our framework finally sect 4 concludes our paper in this subsection we describe our framework qescalor in detail in fig 1 which contains three modules the online operator performance sampler oopser the operator performance and resource provision modeler oprpmer and the quantitative elasticity controller qecer as is shown in fig 1 the qescalor is an important module in the datadock in our previous work 11 we present our distributed stream processing system datadock mainly aiming at processing the heterogeneous data in real-time
 we use the oopser to learn the correlation samples of the operator performance and resource provision online then we use these samples as the input of the oprpmer to build the operator performance and resource provision model oprpm at last we use the qecer to adjust the scaling plan according to the workload prediction of the bgelasor 11 the operator performance prediction of the omopredictor 12 and the oprpm as is shown in fig 1 we take the dspa including the new operator documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentperfcand cdot totalt in workloadt workloadmaxenddocument at last we use dynamic programming to calculate the minimal cost
 settings our experiments run on kubernetes k8s cluster which we use as the resource manager on the datadock including eight servers the version of k8s is 1141 there are two types of servers in the k8s cluster two gpu servers and six cpu servers each gpu server comprises 36 cores intel xeon cpu e5-2697 v4 230 ghz 256 gb memory two nvidia geforce gtx 1060ti cards and 500 gb disks each cpu server comprises 36 cores intel xeon cpu e5-2697 v4 230 ghz 256 gb memory and 500 gb disks we use the gpu servers to run the jobmanager conducting the training and evaluation we adopt the cpu servers to run the task manager in which the operator instance runs besides we conduct the evaluation of the oprpmer with sklearn 0221 running on python 37 datasets in table 1 we show our datasets and the intermediate results of our model at different stages firstly we present the we use the real online workload processed by the datadock in a day as the original dataset oriwl-1day in oopser we use two sampling algorithms which are fssa and dsa to sample oriwl-1day f1 f2 f3 f4 and f5 denote different steps of fssa a b c and d represent that the original dataset is processed by these operators co1 denotes cpu operator and cmo1 denotes cpu-memory operator in oprpmer we use dsa-abcd as the train set and use f1-abcd as the test set then we obtain the output of the random forest regression rfr dsa-rfr-abcd in qecer we should evaluate the system performance from oprmer we use dsa-rfr-abcd as the input from omopredictor we adopt op-pm-30 as the input which represents the operator performance on datadock online for 30 days for the input of the bgelasor we use oriwl-60days-flowstat which represents the flow statistics for 60 days of data load on the datadock online
 in our algorithm we guarantee the latency to reduce the total cost thus we evaluate the quantitative elasticity controller from two aspects the total cost and the end-to-end latency guarantee we use the cost-balance-algorithm cba 11 as the baseline algorithm the cba considers the running cost and the operation cost compared to the cba the qcesa takes the operator resource provision into account the performance of qcesa depends on the sampling of oopser and the predicted results of oprpmer for the oopser we compare our method dsa with the fixed-step-sampling-algorithm fssa to demonstrate that dsa is more accurate in the sampling stage to enhance scheduling accuracy and reduce the cost for evaluating the oprpmer we compare the random forest regression model rfr with the following methods adaboost gbdt and xgboost to demonstrate that rfr is more suitable for the current application scenarios it can get more accurate prediction results and affect the overall performance of scheduling total cost in this part we take the cmo1 as an example to compare by using the total cost of elastic scaling we use the workload prediction to generate the scaling plan for the cmo1 and calculate the total cost moreover to evaluate the effectiveness of the qcesa we use four different resource provisions to test the cba respectively the four resource provision granularities are as follows 1 documentclass12ptminimal

 in fig 2 we can find that most of the time the total cost of the qcesa is less than that of the cba besides as the system runs the performance of the qcesa is becoming much higher than the cba end-to-end latency guarantee in this part we focus on the end-to-end latency guarantee we still take the cmo1 as an example to run on the datadock and monitor the end-to-end latency
 in fig 3 we can see that both the qcesa and the cba can guarantee that the performance of the operator is no less than the workload and the end-to-end latency always stays stable and satisfies the requirement of the qos the reason is that both algorithms start the instances before the workload rises thus they can process the workload timely impact of sampling to measure the impact of sampling we compare the dsa with the fixed-step-sampling-algorithm fssa in oopser we run the fssa and the dsa separately to collect the correlation samples of the four operators for each operator we run the dsa with the sampling step set to 1 and use the sampling result as the baseline besides we also run the fssa with the sampling step set to 2 3 4 and 5 as the contrast evaluation after we get all correlation samples of four operators with the fssa and the dsa we use the oprpmer to build the oprpms then we predict the operator performance based on the minimum sampling step using the oprpms we use the root mean square errors rmse the mean absolute errors mae and the sampling number sn to evaluate the effectiveness of the dsa documentclass12ptminimal

 as is shown in table 2 we can observe that the performance of the fssa is not stable when the step of the fssa is 2 the co1 and the cmo1 get the best performance but when the step of the fssa is 3 the co2 and the cmo2 get the best performance and the dsa performs well for all the four operators its performance is close to or even reaches the best performance moreover the dsa has fewer sampling numbers when reaching the same performance it benefits from the dynamical sampling strategy we show the sampling result of the co1 and the cmo2 in fig 4 we can see where the performance fluctuates obviously the sampling step is close to the minimum sampling step instead when the performance changes smoothly the dsa only uses a few sampling points to capture the main characteristics of performance changes

 comparison of prediction methods to enhance the total performance we should select the better prediction method for the oprpmer so we compare the random forest regression model with the following methods adaboost gbdt and xgboost to demonstrate the effectiveness of the rfr model in this scenario we use the rmse and the mae to evaluate the performances of each model there are several hyper-parameters in these approaches we use the grid search and 10-folds cross-validation to select the key hyper-parameters besides we normalize all the input to the range 01 using the min-max scaler we repeat the experiment 10 times for each model to reduce the random experimental error and take the average of the whole test results as the final result as for the rfr we set documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentboostergbtree learningrate01 maxdepth3 nestimators100enddocument table 3 shows that the effectiveness of the ensemble learning is significantly better than the svr because in our scenario the size of the correlation sample set is smaller the advantage of the ensemble learning is more prominent besides there is not much difference between the adaboost gbdt and xgboost however compared to the above boosting models the rfr performs better because the rfr model adopts the bootstrap strategy it can effectively prevent overfitting when the size of the sample set is small in this paper we present a quantitative elastic scaling framework named qescalor to allocate resources for the operator instances quantitatively based on the actual performance requirements it contains three key modules the oopser the oprrmer and the qecer firstly we use the oopser to learn the correlation samples of the operator performance and resource provision online then we use these samples as the input of the oprpmer to build the operator performance and resource provision model oprpm by using the random forest regression model at last we use the qecer to adjust the scaling plan according to the real workload fluctuation the experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art methods the qescalor is better on the real-world datasets and we can address the problem which ignores the correlation between the operator performance and resource provision  application of genetically engineered pigs in biomedical research magdalena hryhorowicz daniel lipiski szymon hryhorowicz agnieszka nowak-terpiowska natalia ryczek joanna zeyland   pigs have been extensively used in biomedical research due to anatomical and physiological similarities to humans moreover progress in gene editing platforms and construct delivery methods allow efficiently targeted modifications of the porcine genome and significantly broadened the application of pig models in biopharming and biomedicine target editing is possible through site-specific nucleases of which the following are most commonly used zinc finger nucleases zfns transcription activator-like effectors tales and nucleases from the crisprcas clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatscrispr associated system introducing modifications in a specific site of the genome is possible due to cellular processes of repairing double-strand breaks induced by site-specific nucleases double-strand breaks may be repaired in two ways by non-homologous end joining nhej or by homologous recombination hr repair provided by nhej may lead to the formation of indel insertiondeletion mutations in the target site that may be used to inactivate selected genes in turn repairing double-strand breaks by hr using a donor template allows for the introduction or elimination of specific point mutations and the introduction of any foreign genes pigs can be modified to create porcine models of human disease 1 produce recombinant proteins 2 or provide tissue and organs for xenotransplantation 3 currently microinjection or somatic cell nuclear transfer scnt is most commonly used to obtain genetically modified animals the microinjection is the oldest method for producing transgenic animals 45 this well-developed technology involves the injection of the dna material into the male pronucleus the rna material into the cytoplasm or proteins into cytoplasm or pronucleus because of the difficulty in recognizing the male pronucleus often microinjection is simply made into one pronucleus the efficiency of microinjection depends among others on the solution purity its concentration material form dnarnaprotein the lengthsize of the introduced structure with increasing lengthsize the efficiency decreases the skills of the operator procedure or embryo development stage due to the low efficiency of this procedure of about 10 in mice 23 in pig 4 in rabbit and less than 1 in cattle researchers are introducing modifications to increase the number of successful microinjections and further transgenesis 678 one of the introduced changes was the simultaneous injection of the transgene into both pronuclei increased transgene integration efficiency has been observed with the high invasiveness of the process resulting in high embryo mortality 9 subsequent tests were performed using dna microinjection directly into the embryo cytoplasm in this method the problem of high invasiveness of injections was eliminated while a problem arose with the integration of exogenous dna and a further drastic decrease in the procedure efficiency 10 this problem was eliminated by providing genetic material into the cytoplasm in the form of rna in this case the stability of the material is a critical element the third modification of dna microinjection carried out by scientists was the delivery of the transgene into the cell nuclei of a two-blastomeric embryo it was aimed at increasing the survival rate of the embryos however due to the higher probability of obtaining mosaic than transgenic animals it is not commonly used in transgenesis 11 another method by which transgenic animals can be obtained is the use of transformed cells for somatic cloning interest in somatic cell nuclear transfer has been increasing since 1996 when the dolly sheep was cloned for the first time 12 this method despite very low efficiency 0510 in livestock animals allows for the use of a wide range of available approaches related to the cells genetic modification whose cell nuclei are later used for cloning the choice of delivery method for exogenous dna depends on its length used cells and transfection efficiency after the identification of cells with appropriate modification they should be brought to the g0 phase of the cell cycle the cell nuclei of the modified cells are then transferred into the enucleated oocytes the quality of oocytes and their age affect the cloning process the whole method of obtaining transgenic animals by using transformed cells for somatic cloning has many advantages but its main disadvantage is high fetal mortality resulting primarily from genetic defects 13 a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of microinjection and scnt is presented in table 1 cystic fibrosis cf is an autosomal recessive disorder manifested by bronchopulmonary failure and pancreatic enzyme insufficiency cf is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for the synthesis of the cftr cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel altering the mucosal function in the respiratory epithelium pancreatic ducts intestines and sweat glands the most common cystic fibrosis-causing mutation is the deletion of a phenylalanine at amino acid position 508 df508 cf lung disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cf patients porcine lungs share many anatomical and histological similarities with humans it has been shown that pigs in which the cftr gene was inactivated develop all symptoms of the disease occurring in humans such as meconium ileus defective chloride transport pancreatic destruction and focal biliary cirrhosis this makes them a very good model species for this disease 141516 cystic fibrosis is a monogenic disease and the insertion of the functional cftr gene into cf patient cells should theoretically restore the cftr channel function therefore pigs have also been used in gene therapy the treatment with viral vectors successfully improved anion transport and inhibited bacterial growth 1718 currently the research focuses on improving the cf gene therapy with the use of the crisprcas9 system these efforts are focused on increasing the delivery efficiency of crisprcas9 elements to target locus and obtaining sustained expression of the cftr transgene 1920 it was demonstrated that precise integration of the human cftr gene at a porcine safe harbor locus through crisprcas9-induced hdr-mediated knock-in allowed the achievement of persistent in vitro expression of the transgene in transduced cells these results can help design effective gene therapy to treat cf patients 20 duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is a progressive monogenic x-linked lethal disease characterized by degenerative changes in muscle fibers and the connective tissue it involves the degeneration of subsequent musclesskeletal respiratory and cardiacand progressive muscular dystrophy muscular dystrophy is caused by a frameshift mutation in the dmd gene which encodes dystrophin a protein in muscle cells that connects the cytoskeleton with the cell membrane the dystrophin gene contains 79 exons with exons 37 and 4555 being the most susceptible to mutations dmd gene mutations are usually large deletions or duplications of one or several exons as well as point mutations leading to a change in the reading frame the appearance of a premature stop codon and failure to produce a stable protein muscular dystrophy is most often diagnosed in early childhood and patients become wheelchair dependent by 12 years of age untreated boys die of cardiorespiratory complications around their 20 years the rapid progress in gene editing gives hope for effective targeted therapies for dmd moreover the use of an animal model can facilitate the development of personalized treatment approaches pigs with a dmd gene mutation exon 52 deletion develop human disease symptoms such as lack of dystrophin in skeletal muscles increased serum creatine kinase levels progressive muscle dystrophy and impaired mobility 21 however these animals died prematurely up to 3 months old at most what precluded natural breeding the histological evaluation of skeletal muscles and diaphragm confirmed the presence of excessive fiber size variation hypercontracted fibers and segmentally necrotic fibers resembled that of human dmd patients 21 moreover proteome analysis of biceps femoris muscle was performed an increased amount of muscle repair-related proteins and reduced amount of respiratory chain proteins was found in tissue from 3-month-old dmd pigs this indicated severe disturbances in aerobic energy production and a decrease in functional muscle tissue 22 as the deletion of exon 52 in the human dmd gene is a common cause of duchenne muscular dystrophy pigs can make an accurate research model for gene therapy another porcine dmd model is genetically modified miniature pigs with a mutation in exon 27 in the dmd gene obtained by the crisprcas9 system in addition these animals have shown symptoms of skeletal and heart muscle degeneration characteristic of human patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy reduced thickness of smooth muscle in the stomach and intestine was also observed in the pigs studied however founder pigs died of unreported causes 23 although mutations in exon 27 are not reported in human dmd patients pigs with this deletion constitute another useful animal dmd model recently moretti et al demonstrated the restoration of dystrophin by intramuscular injection of crisprcas9 components with the use of adeno-associated viral vectors in a pig model in this study pigs with dmd carrying a deletion of dmd exon 52 d52dmd resulting in a complete loss of dystrophin expression were used the restoration of dystrophin expression was possible due to the excision of exon 51 and the restoration of the dmd reading frame the internally truncated d51-52dmd sufficed to improve skeletal muscle function prevent malignant arrhythmias as well as prolonging lifespan of dmd pigs 24 in the future this strategy may prove useful in the clinical treatment of patients with d52dmd alzheimers disease ad is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory dysfunction followed by cognitive decline and disorientation ad accounts for 5080 of human dementia cases familial forms of ad are caused by autosomal mutations in the genes encoding presenilin 1 psen1 and presenilin 2 psen2 and amyloid precursor protein app these mutations are associated with the accumulation of amyloid  a peptide in senile plaques and phosphorylated tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles nfts which leads to synaptic damage and neuronal dysfunction 25 the first ad model with the use of transgenic pigs was generated in 2009 by kragh et al they produced gttingen mini pigs that carried a randomly integrated construct containing the cdna of the human app gene with ad causing a dominant mutation known as the swedish mutation appsw and a human pdgf promoter fragment 26 although the transgene was specifically expressed in brain tissue at a high level no ad phenotype was observed in mutant pigs the same group also obtained gttingen minipigs with the human psen1 gene carrying the ad-causing met146ile mutation psen1 m146i and driven by a cytomegalovirus cmv-enhanced human ubic promoter pigs were generated with the use of a site-specific integration systemrecombinase-mediated cassette exchange rmce 27 the psen1 m146i protein was expressed and tolerated well in the porcine brain but also in this case no symptoms of the ad disease were noticed therefore this group generated double transgenic gttingen minipigs with both appsw and psen1 m146i mutations such a solution allowed the increase in intraneuronal accumulation of a 28 in turn another group obtained ad transgenic pigs using a retroviral multi-cistronic vector containing three ad-related human genes app tau and psen1 with a total of six well-characterized mutations under the control of a fusion promoter cmve hpdgf promoter region they confirmed that transgenes were expressed at high levels in brain tissue and demonstrated a two-fold increase in a levels in the brains of transgenic pigs compared to wild-type 29 cancer is a genetic disease involving uncontrolled abnormal cell growth in the blood or solid organs resulting from acquired or inherited mutations pigs represent a useful animal for the development and validation of new medicines and procedures in human tumor models there are many resemblances in cancer biology between pigs and humans these animals can correctly mimic human tumors and show similar pharmacokinetic responses to humans adam et al demonstrated that autologous transplantation of primary porcine cells transformed with retroviral oncogenic vectors caused tumorigenesis akin to those found in humans 30 in turn schook et al induced tumor formation in pigs by introducing random transgenes that encode cre-dependent kras kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog g12d and tp53 tumor protein 53 r167h oncogenic mutations orthologous to human tp53 r175h 31 moreover saalfrank et al reported that porcine mesenchymal stem cells mscs resemble human mscs requiring disturbance of p53 kras and myc signaling pathways to become a fully transformed phenotype 32 at present pig models commonly used in cancer research include the tp53 knock-out model of osteosarcoma and apc adenomatous polyposis coli mutations model of familial adenomatous polyposis fap tp53 is a known tumor suppressor gene and a germline mutation within this gene leads to lifraumeni syndrome a rare autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes carriers to cancer development the first model of lifraumeni syndrome using genetically modified pigs has been described by leuchs et al they generated pigs carrying a latent tp53 r167h mutation that can be activated by the cre-lox recombinase system 33 after several years of observation it was noted that both pigs with homozygous tp53 knock-out and pigs with heterozygous knock-out of tp53 showed osteosarcoma development the heterozygous knock-out caused the development of spontaneous osteosarcoma in older animals while homozygous tp53 knock-out resulted in multiple large osteosarcomas in 7 to 8-month-old pigs 32 moreover sieren and colleagues generated genetically modified yucatan minipigs that carried the tp53 r167h mutation animals heterozygous for this mutant allele showed no tumorigenesis process whereas homozygotes that reached sexual maturity developed lymphomas osteogenic tumors and renal tumors at varying rates the tumor formations were validated by computed tomography histopathological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging 34 familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited disorder characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum which greatly increases the risk of colorectal cancer the mutations in the apc tumor-suppressor gene are responsible for fap and may result in a hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer flisikowska et al generated gene-targeted cloned pigs with translational stop signals at codon 1311 in porcine apc apc 1311 orthologous to common germline apc 1309 mutations in human fap evaluation of one-year-old pigs carrying the apc 1311 mutation showed aberrant crypt foci and adenomatous polyps with low- to high-grade intraepithelial dysplasia similar to tumor progression as in human fap 35 the apc 1311 pig model resulting in the development of polyposis in the colon and rectum can be useful in the diagnosis and therapy of colorectal cancer cardiovascular diseases cvds are the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide cvd is a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels that involve coronary heart disease such as angina and myocardial infarction deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism peripheral arterial disease cerebrovascular disease and rheumatic heart disease the dominant cause of cvd is atherosclerosis which is characterized by the narrowing of arteries due to the accumulation of lipid and plaque formation the plaque buildup restricts blood flow and plaque burst can entail blood clots similarities in heart anatomy and physiology vessel size blood parameters coronary artery system anatomy and lipoprotein metabolism make pigs a suitable model for the human cardiovascular system atherosclerosis starts with the buildup of serum low-density lipoprotein ldl and mutations in the ldl receptor ldlr gene may cause familial hypercholesterolemia fh a porcine fh model has been generated in yucatan miniature pigs through recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated targeted disruptions of the endogenous ldlr gene ldlr heterozygous pigs exhibited mild hypercholesterolemia while ldlr homozygotes animals were born with severe hypercholesterolemia and developed atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries these phenotypes were accelerated by high fat and high cholesterol diets 36 the utilization of ldlr-deficient yucatan minipigs in the preclinical evaluation of therapeutics was also demonstrated ldlr and ldlr pigs were used to assess the ability of novel drugbempedoic acid bemato reduce cholesterol biosynthesis long-term treatment with bema decreased ldl cholesterol and attenuated aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in this fa model 37 moreover a model of fa and atherosclerosis was created by using the yucatan miniature pigs with liver-specific expression of a human proprotein convertase subtilisinkexin type 9 pcsk9 carrying the gain-of-function mutation d374y pcsk9 plays important functions in cholesterol homeostasis by reducing ldlr levels on the plasma membrane gain-of-function mutations in this protein cause increased levels of plasma ldl cholesterol which in turn may result in more susceptibility to coronary heart disease pcsk9 d374y transgenic pigs exhibited decreased hepatic ldlr levels severe hypercholesterolemia on high-fat high-cholesterol diets and atherosclerotic lesions 38 it is also considered that hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease in which apolipoprotein apociii is associated with plasma triglyceride levels the hypertriglyceridemic apociii transgenic miniature pig model was generated for the examination of the correlation between hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis transgenic pigs expressing human apociii exhibited increased plasma triglyceride levels with their delayed clearance and reduced lipoprotein lipase activity compared to non-transgenic controls 39 diabetes mellitus dm is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia elevated levels of blood sugar over a prolonged period which results from deficiency or ineffectiveness of insulin dm may lead over time to cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease damage to the nerves and eyes there are two main types of diabetes mellitus called type 1 and type 2 type 1 dm also referred to as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is caused by the pancreass failure to produce enough insulin the most common is type 2 diabetes which is characterized by insulin resistance reduced tissue sensitivity to insulin that may be combined with relative insulin deficiency the anatomical and physiological resemblance to the human pancreas and islets makes pigs excellent animals for metabolic diseases modeling moreover the structure of porcine and human insulin is also very similar differs by only one amino acid a transgenic pig model for type 2 dm was generated to evaluate the role of impaired glucose-dependent insulinotropic poly-peptide gip the main function of incretin hormones gip and glucagon-like peptide-1 glp1 is stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner in type 2 dm the insulinotropic action of gip is impaired which may suggest its association with early disease pathogenesis the transgenic pigs expressing a dominant negative gip receptor giprdn in pancreatic cells were produced by lentiviral vectors a significant reduction in oral glucose tolerance due to delayed insulin secretion as well as in -cell mass caused by diminished cell proliferation was observed in giprdn animals 40 these observations resemble the characteristic features of human type 2 diabetes which makes the porcine giprdn model useful for testing incretin-based therapeutic strategies further analyses revealed characteristic changes in plasma concentrations of seven amino acids phe orn val xleu his arg and tyr and specific lipids sphingomyelins diacylglycerols and ether phospholipids in the plasma of 5-month-old giprdn transgenic pigs that correlate significantly with -cell mass 41 these metabolites represent possible biomarkers for the early stages of prediabetes moreover the porcine giprdn model has been used to test liraglutide glp1 receptor agonist which improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients ninety-day liraglutide treatment of adolescent transgenic pigs resulted in improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity as well as reduction in body weight gain and food intake compared to placebo-treated animals however the use of liraglutide did not stimulate beta-cell proliferation in the endocrine pancreas 42 another type of diabetes type 3 dm is maturity-onset diabetes of the young mody3 mody3 is a noninsulin-dependent type of diabetes with an autosomal dominant inheritance and is caused by mutations in the human hepatocyte nuclear factor 1  hnf1 gene mutation in hnf1 gene leads to pancreatic -cell dysfunction and impaired insulin secretion a pig model for mody3 was generated by expressing a mutant human hnf1 gene hnf1 p291fsinsc using intracytoplasmic sperm injection-mediated gene transfer and somatic cell nuclear transfer the transgenic piglets exhibited the pathophysiological characteristics of diabetes including high glucose level and reduced insulin secretion from the small and irregularly formed langerhans islets 43 furthermore hnf1 p291fsinsc pigs revealed nodular lesions in the renal glomeruli diabetic retinopathy and cataract complications similar to those in patients with dm 44 mutations in the insulin ins gene may result in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus pndm in humans a pndm large animal model was establish by generated pigs expressing a mutant porcine ins gene ins c94y orthologous to human ins c96y transgenic animals showed signs of pndm such as lower fasting insulin levels decreased -cell mass reduced body weight and cataract development in addition ins c94y pigs exhibited significant -cell impairment including the reduction in insulin secretory granules and dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum 45 the porcine ins c94y model was further used to perform analysis of pathological changes in retinas and evaluation of the liver of transgenic pigs the studies revealed several features of diabetic retinopathy such as intraretinal microvascular abnormalities or central retinal edema 46 moreover the multi-omics analysis of the liver demonstrated higher activities in amino acid metabolism oxidation of fatty acids gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis characteristic of insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus 47 the genetically modified pig models for human diseases described in this review are summarized in table 2 human-derived proteins have long been used as therapeutics in the treatment of numerous diseases however their quantities are limited by the availability of human tissues thanks to the development of biotechnology and genetic engineering modified animals can be used as bioreactors to produce recombinant proteins for pharmaceutical use by using adequate regulatory sequences promoters the expression of transgenes can be directed to selected cells and organs the therapeutic proteins can be obtained from milk blood urine seminal plasma egg white or salivary gland that can be collected purified and used at an industrial scale moreover it is possible to generate multi-transgenic animals that produce many biopharmaceuticals or vaccines in a single organism the use of an animal platform allows for the relatively low-cost production of pharmacologically valuable preparations in high quantity and quality the mammary gland is considered to be an excellent bioreactor system for pharmaceutical protein production the advantage of milk is that it contains large amounts of foreign proteins that do not affect the animals health during lactation as well as the ease of product collection and purification while cows are the best species for obtaining large amounts of pharmaceuticals in milk the cost and time necessary to carry out successful transgenesis make rabbits sheep goats and pigs more popular species although the pig is not a typical dairy animal a lactating sow can give about 300 l of milk per year velander et al generated transgenic pigs that synthesized human protein c in the mammary gland protein c plays an important role in human blood clotting which makes it a potentially attractive drug the collected milk contained 1 gl of this protein 48 other recombinant human proteins involved in the coagulation process such as factor viii 49 factor ix 5051 von willebrand factor 52 were also successfully obtained in the porcine mammary gland furthermore the line of transgenic pigs producing functional recombinant human erythropoietin in their milk was demonstrated erythropoietin regulates red blood cell production erythropoiesis in the bone marrow by binding to a specific membrane receptor and has been used in the treatment of anemia this bioreactor system generates active recombinant human erythropoietin at concentrations of approximately 8779  928 iu1 ml 53 in turn lu et al generated transgenic cloned pigs expressing large quantities of recombinant human lysozyme in milk lysozyme is a natural broad-spectrum antimicrobial enzyme which constitutes part of the innate immune system the authors demonstrated that the highest concentration of recombinant human lysozyme with in vitro bioactivity was 27596  2650 mgl 54 biopharmaceuticals can also be synthesized in pigs with the use of alternative systems such as blood urine and semen the blood of transgenic animals can be a source of human blood proteins such as hemoglobin swanson et al and sharma et al obtained transgenic pigs that produced recombinant human hemoglobin in their blood cells at a high level with the ability to bind oxygen identical to that of human blood hemoglobin 5556 there remains however the issue of obtaining large amounts of animal-generated therapeutics easily and inexpensively without killing the animal moreover blood cannot store high levels of recombinant proteins for a long time which are innately unstable and bioactive proteins in the blood may affect the metabolism of the animals 57 for this reason research is being conducted into the production of recombinant proteins secreted into the urine or semen the advantage of semen is that it is easily obtained and produced in high amounts in species such as pigs boars can produce 200300 ml of semen 23 times a week while the advantage of urine is that proteins can be obtained from animals of both sexes throughout their lives in addition urine contains few proteins which facilitates the purification of the protein product and the urine-based systems pose a low risk to the animals health however the limitation of protein production in the bladder is low yield 58 the recombinant pharmaceutical proteins produced from transgenic pigs are listed in table 3 pig organs transplanted into human recipients are immediately rejected as a result of the so-called hyperacute immunological reaction xenograft rejection is mainly caused by the gal antigen found on the donors cell surface which is synthesized by the ggta-1 enzyme humans lack both the gal antigen and the ggta-1 enzyme but have xenoreactive antibodies directed against the porcine gal antigen which leads to the so-called enzymatic complement cascade in the recipient the sequence of reactions results in a formation membrane attack complex lysis and destruction of the graft cells the best possible solution to the problem of hyperacute rejection is to inactivate the gene encoding the ggta-1 enzyme responsible for the formation of the gal antigen in 2001 the first heterozygous ggta1 knock-out pigs were produced 59 and one year later the first piglets with two knock-out alleles of the ggta1 gene were born 60 a series of ggta1 knock-out pigs has also been generated by using zfns 61 talens 62 and the crisprcas9 system 63 moreover other carbohydrate xenoantigens present on pig cells but absent in humans have been identified and include neu5gc antigen n-glycolylneuraminic acid catalyzed by cytidine monophosphate-n-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase cmah and the sda antigen produced by beta-14-n-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 2 4galnt2 pigs with ggta1cmah4galnt2 triple gene knock-out were generated using the crisprcas9 system cells from these genetically modified animals exhibited a reduced level of human igm and igg binding resulting in diminished porcine xenoantigenicity 64 to prevent hyperacute rejection it is possible to introduce human genes regulating the enzymatic complement cascade into the porcine genome as the complement system may undergo spontaneous autoactivation and attack the bodys own cells defense mechanisms have developed in the course of evolution they regulate complement activity through a family of structurally and functionally similar proteins blocking complement activation and preventing the formation of a membrane attack complex mac introduction of human genes encoding complement inhibitors such as cd55 daf decay-accelerating factor cd46 mcp membrane cofactor protein cd59 membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis into the porcine genome may overcome xenogeneic hyperacute organ rejection 65 it was demonstrated that the expression of human complement-regulatory proteins can prevent complement-mediated xenograft injury and prolong the survival time of the xenotransplant 666768 studies have shown that the absence of ggta1 and additional human cd55 cd59 or cd46 expression has greater survival rates than just ggta1 knock-out 6970 many genetically modified pigs with human complement inhibitors and other modifications important for xenotransplantation were also generated 717273 the modifications of the porcine genome described above largely resolved the problem of hyperacute rejection however xenogenic transplant becomes subject to less severe rejection mechanisms resulting from coagulation dysregulation natural killer nk cells-mediated cytotoxicity macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity as well as t-cell response the coagulative disorders result from incompatibilities between pig anticoagulants and human coagulation factors overcoming coagulation dysregulation in xenotransplantation will require the introduction of human gene encoding coagulationregulatory proteins into the porcine genome for example thrombomodulin tbm endothelial cell protein c receptor epcr tissue factor pathway inhibitor tfpi and ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 cd39 thrombomodulin binds thrombin and functions as a cofactor for the activation of protein c which is strongly anticoagulative porcine tbm binds human thrombin less strongly and cannot effectively activate protein c it was demonstrated that expressing human tbm htbm in porcine aortic endothelial cells paecs suppresses prothrombinase activity and delays clotting time 71 the endothelial protein c receptor enhances the activation of protein c and decreases proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in vitro studies revealed the correlation between human epcr hepcr expression in paecs and reduced human platelet aggregation 74 a meta-analysis of multiple genetic modifications on pig lung xenotransplant showed that hepcr was one of the modifications that had a positive effect on xenograft survival prolongation in the ex vivo organ perfusion model with human blood 75 further study demonstrated that kidneys from genetically-engineered pigs carrying six modifications functioned in baboons for 237 and 260 days the authors suggested that prolonged survival time was associated among others with the expression of the human epcr gene 76 tissue factor pathway inhibitor is the primary physiological regulator of the early stage of coagulation tfpi binds to factor xa and then xatfpi inhibits the procoagulant activity of the tissue factor tffactor viia complex it was demonstrated that the expression of human tfpi in paecs can inhibit tf activity suggesting potential for controlling the tf-dependent pathway of blood coagulation in xenotransplantation 77 more recently multi-modified pigs carrying human tfpi transgene were produced 7678 cd39 is an ectoenzyme that plays a key role in reducing platelet activation cd39 converts adenosine triphosphate atp and adenosine diphosphate adp to adenosine monophosphate amp which in turn is further degraded by ecto-5-nucleotidase cd73 to antithrombotic adenosine transgenic pigs with human cd39 hcd39 gene were generated the study showed that hcd39 expression protects against myocardial injury in a model of myocardial acute ischemia-reperfusion injury 79 another approach to xenograft protection may be introducing a human gene that protects against the inflammatory response into the porcine genome transgenic pigs expressing antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory proteins such as human heme oxygenase-1 ho-1 and human tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 a20 were produced 8081 porcine aortic endothelial cells derived from pigs carrying human a20 transgene were protected against tnf- tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated apoptosis and less susceptible to cell death induced by cd95 fas ligands 81 similarly overexpression of human ho-1 ensured prolonged porcine kidney survival in an ex vivo perfusion model with human blood and paecs protection from tnf--mediated apoptosis 80 furthermore pigs with a combined expression of human a20 and ho-1 on a ggta1 knock-out background were generated that transgenic approach alleviated rejection and ischemia-reperfusion damage during ex vivo kidney perfusion 82 the cellular immune response is another barrier to xenotransplantation human nk cells can activate the endothelium and lyse porcine cells through direct nk cytotoxicity and by antibody-dependent cellular mechanisms direct nk cytotoxicity is regulated by activating and inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions to prevent nk-mediated lysis through the inhibitory cd94nkg2a receptor pigs with human leukocyte antigens- e hla-e were obtained 8384 the study showed that the expression of hla-e in endothelial cells from transgenic pigs markedly reduces xenogeneic human nk responses in addition it was demonstrated that the introduction of the hla-e gene into the porcine genome may also protect pig cells from macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity 85 more recently ggta1 knock-out pigs with hcd46 and hla-ehuman 2-microglobulin transgenes were produced the study showed that multiple genetically modified porcine hearts were protected from complement activation and myocardial natural killer cell infiltration in an ex vivo perfusion model with human blood 86 another approach to inhibit direct xenogeneic nk cytotoxicity is the elimination of porcine ul-16-binding protein 1 ulbp1 which binds to nkg2d activating nk receptors crispr technology was adapted to create genetically modified pigs with a disrupted ul16-binding protein 1 gene in vitro studies confirmed that porcine aortic endothelial cells derived from ulbp1 knock-out pigs were less susceptible to nk-cells cytotoxic effects 87 macrophages also play an important role in xenograft rejection and can be activated by direct interactions between receptors present on their surface and donor endothelial antigens as well as by xenoreactive t lymphocytes the binding cd47 antigen to macrophage surface signaling regulatory protein sirp- delivers a signal to prevent phagocytosis however the interaction between porcine cd47 and human sirp- does not supply the inhibitory effect on macrophages 88 therefore the introduction of human cd47 hcd47 into the porcine genome can overcome macrophage-mediated responses in xenotransplantation the overexpression of hcd47 in porcine endothelial cells suppressed the phagocytic and cytotoxic activity of macrophages decreased inflammatory cytokine tnf- il-6 il-1 secretion and inhibited the infiltration of human t cells 89 the pigs with ggta1 knock-out and hcd47 were obtained 90 it was demonstrated that the expression of human cd47 markedly prolonged survival of donor porcine skin xenografts on baboons in the absence of immunosuppression 91 another challenge in xenotransplantation is the prevention of t cell-mediated rejection t cells can be induced directly by swine leukocyte antigen sla class i and class ii on porcine antigen-presenting cells apcs or by swine donor peptides presented on recipient apcs the main co-stimulatory signals regulating t cell function include cd40cd154 and cd28cd8086 pathways the cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin ctla4 can inhibit the cd28cd8086 co-stimulatory pathway therefore the introduction of human ctla4-ig hctla4-ig into the porcine genome may alleviate t cell response in xenografts it was shown that neuronal expression of hctla4-ig in pigs reduced human t lymphocyte proliferation 92 moreover transgenic hctla4-ig protein in pigs extended the survival time of porcine skin grafts in a xenogeneic rat transplantation model 93 another approach to inhibit t-cell immune response may be the deletion of swine leukocyte antigen class i reyes et al created sla class i knock-out pigs using grna and the cas9 endonuclease the obtained animals revealed decreased levels of cd4cd8 t cells in peripheral blood 94 recently pigs carrying functional knock-outs of ggta1 cmah b4galnt2 and sla class i with multi-transgenic background hcd46 hcd55 hcd59 hho1 ha20 were produced in vitro study presented that the four-fold knock-out reduced the binding of human igg and igm to porcine kidney cells 95 beyond immune barriers in xenotransplantation there is also concern about the risk of cross-species pathogens infection the main problem constitutes porcine endogenous retroviruses perv which are integrated into multiple locations in the pig genome utilizing the crisprcas9 technology gives great hopes for the complete elimination of the risk of perv transmission niu et al using the crisprcas9 system inactivated all 25 copies of functional pervs in a porcine primary cell line and successfully generated healthy perv-inactivated pigs via somatic cell nuclear transfer what is more no reinfection was observed in the obtained pigs 96 advances in genetic engineering and immunosuppressive therapies prolong organ survival time in preclinical pig-to-non-human primate nhp xenotransplantation models the first xenotransplantation using pig hearts with eliminated gal antigen into immunosuppressed baboons was performed in 2005 the longest surviving heterotopic graft functioned in the recipient for 179 days 97 in comparison to 4-6 hours of survival time with the use of wild-type pig hearts 98 introducing additional modifications extended the xenograft survival time even more the longest survival was obtained for heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantationup to 945 days the authors used hearts derived from genetically multimodified pigs ggta1 knock-out hcd46 htbm and chimeric 2c10r4 anti-cd40 antibody therapy 99 additional expression of htbm in ggta1 knock-out hcd46 genetically modified pigs prevented early dysregulation of coagulation and prolonged the cardiac xenografts survival time 99100 using the same genetic background orthotopic heart xenotransplantation was performed resulting in a maximum survival of 195 days 101 however xenograft survival time depends on the types of transplanted organs in the case of kidneys in pig-to-nhp transplantation models the longest survival of a life-sustaining xenograft was 499 days ggta1 knock-out pigs carrying hcd55 gene as well as immunosuppression with transient pant cell depletion and an anti-cd154based regimen were used in the experiments moreover the selection of recipients with low-titer anti-pig antibodies improved the long-term survival of pig-to-rhesus macaque renal xenotransplants 102 the success of porcine liver and lung xenotransplantation remains limited which is mainly associated with the occurrence of coagulation disorders 103 the longest survival time for orthotopic liver xenografts 29 days was achieved using ggta1 knock-out pigs exogenous human coagulation factors and immunosuppression including co-stimulation blockade 104 in turn watanabe et al demonstrated prolonged survival time of lung xenotransplants 14 days from ggta1 knock-out hcd47hcd55 donor pigs in immunosuppressed baboons 105 the authors indicated the important role of hcd47 expression in reducing immunologic damages and extending lung graft survival in the pig-to-nhp model however additional genetic modifications of the porcine genome and immunosuppressive regimen strategy are necessary for the clinical application of xenotransplantation table 4 summarizes the most important genetic modifications of the porcine genome for xenotransplantation purposes the anatomical and physiological similarity between pigs and humans makes this species very interesting for biomedical research 110 the rapid development of genetic engineering in recent years has allowed for precise and efficient modification of the animal genome using site-specific nucleases the nuclease-mediated editing of the porcine genome as well as potential applications of genetically modified pigs in biomedicine are shown in figure 1 certainly the driving force for development is the human mind and ideas that arise in it one of the factors limiting the possibilities of using the potential of our ideas is the technical aspect the transfer of new technologies tested on smaller animal models for example is often limited and requires optimization for a large animal model in the case of crisprcas9 technology a lot of emphasis should be placed on the possibility of reducing the risk of so-called off-targets by improving this system paired nicking has the potential to reduce off-target activity in mice from 501000 times without compromising on-target performance 111 another strategy to limit the number of undesirable off-targets is to increase the specificity of the system in this situation one can focus on enhancing or improving cas9 protein or sgrna modifications protein cas9 properties can be modified or their lifespan can be changed 112113 for the future clinical success it is also important to improve the efficiency of hr-mediated gene correction especially in the situation of treating disease in which a template sequence is delivered to replace the mutated variant another important goal to achieve is the possibility of applying hr not only for dividing cells but also for cells in the post-mitotic stage hopes are placed in the fusion of the crisprcas9 technique and aav adeno-associated virus as a donor template provider 114 considering the low immunogenicity of the aav virus the ability to transduce a wide spectrum of cells in terms of both type and developmental stage and strong limiting factor-capacity it should be considered to minimize the crisprcas9 system or use more than one separate virus to simultaneously exploit the potential of both technologies the use of other delivery systems eg nanoparticles is also worth considering 115 genetically modified pigs serve as an important large animal model for studying the genetic background of human diseases testing novel drugs and therapy methods as well as developing models for gene therapy 116117118 pigs can be used as anatomical eg endovascular surgical behavioral and cytotoxic models ideas for new models of large animals are provided by the reality that shapes current demand a lot has been done pig model for influenza a infection but still there is a need for pig models of other human viral diseases hepatitis b human immunodeficiency virus hiv severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 119 hiv has been modeled in mice filoviruses ebolavirus marburgvirus have been modeled in small animals ie mice hamsters but still we need large models to investigate vaccines and antiviral drugs 120121 transgenic pigs can also be a promising source of recombinant proteins used as pharmacological preparations actually the possibility of using pigs for the production of biopharmaceuticals has been slowed in recent years some studies demonstrated that the pig mammary gland can be used as a complex recombinant protein source with appropriate post-translational modifications 122 despite the advantages of pig animal platform natural secretion correct posttranslational modifications constant production some ethical doubts are probably limiting the boost finally the use of genetically engineered pigs for xenotransplantation is becoming an increasingly feasible alternative to standard allogeneic transplants and a potential solution to the problem of organ shortage the combination of various multi-modified pigs and immunosuppressive therapies is required for overcoming immune rejection and effective xenotransplantation of different solid organs 123124125 when it comes to treating end-stage organ failure biomedical research could go a step further and try to create chimeric genetically modified pigs that would be carriers of human organs 126  conditions that generally bring about bank bailouts bail-ins and other resolution methods allen berger n raluca roman a   as noted above we focus on the two recent crisesthe global financial crisis and european sovereign debt crisisthat brought about most of the bailouts and bail-ins discussed in the book these two crises are inexorably linked and so any separate discussions of them are inevitably flawed the global financial crisis began in the us as the us subprime financial crisis and spread through many linkages to europe and the rest of the world and so it is an integral part of the european sovereign debt crisis the distresses of banks and governments during the european sovereign debt crisis are also inescapably linked in some cases government finances came under pressure because of the economic damages caused by the bank distress and the costs of the bank bailouts in other cases bank distress was exacerbated by sovereign debt problems because the banks invested substantially in sovereign debt particularly the debt of their home countries despite these links we briefly describe these two different crises separately the global financial crisis began as the us subprime financial crisis in 2007q3 when losses on us mortgage-backed securities mbs backed by subprime mortgages started to spread to other markets including the syndicated loan market the interbank lending market and the commercial paper market in some cases these other markets at least partially froze up many banks experienced substantial capital losses and at least partially withdrew from these markets a number of large financial institutions especially thrifts that were heavily involved in subprime lending eg countrywide washington mutual indymac bank investment banks that purchased andor packaged subprime mbs eg bear stearns merrill lynch lehman brothers and a large insurance company that sold many credit default swaps cdss on subprime mbs american international group aig suffered capital liquidity and public confidence problems and either failed were taken over or were individually bailed out as the crisis spread to many commercial banks the tarp program expansion of the discount window and term auction facilities tafs and many other bank bailouts shown in the introduction and described in more detail in chapter 3 occurred it is also notable that bank and thrift failures became so widespread that the fdic deposit insurance fund fell into a deficit position and assessed banks for 3 years of deposit insurance premiums in advance to try to fill this hole us stock market values also plunged significantly with the dow jones industrial average falling by more than half
 as a result of these financial problems the us economy also suffered the most severe recession since the great depression the recession resulted in a number of government programs to stimulate the economy including a massive stimulus government spending package and expansive conventional and unconventional monetary policy stimulus by the federal reserve despite all the bailouts of financial institutions and government stimulus programs economic losses in the us totaled in tens of trillions of dollars as noted in the introduction the us recession officially ended in mid-2009 but economic growth remained slow for many years afterward the financial crisis in the us was more or less concluded by the end of 2009 by which point much of the tarp funds invested in financial institutions had been repaid order had been restored to most of the financial markets and the federal reserve shortly thereafter began rolling back expansions to the discount window and concluded the taf auctions berger and bouwman 2016 however the financial issues continued in other nations the us subprime financial crisis became the global financial crisis as financial losses spread to other countries through financial linkages there are too many such linkages to discuss here but we simply mention one the basel ii capital requirements which had been earlier adopted in europe gave very low capital weights to aaa-rated tranches of us subprime mortgage-backed securities mbs this encouraged their purchases by european banks helping to spread the problems created by these securities across the atlantic the european sovereign debt crisis began in 2008 with the collapse of icelands banking system and then spread to the giips countries greece italy ireland portugal and spain the crisis was significant through 2012 and some might argue that remnants still exist as of this writing some government debt remains on shaky grounds european authorities such as the ecb are still engaging in stimulus and interest rates in a number of nations are negative as indicated above this crisis was precipitated in significant part by the global financial crisis and it involved sovereigns as well as banks which are also linked pagano and sedunov 2016 other contributing factors include the recessions that covered a number of countries the real estate market crisis and property bubbles in several countries and fiscal policies in some nations regarding the latter point greece revealed in 2009 that its previous government had underreported its budget deficit a violation of eu policy prompting fears of a eurozone collapse via political and financial contagion in 2010 with the growing fear of excessive sovereign debt lenders demanded higher interest rates from eurozone states with high debt and deficit levels aggravating their fiscal problems some affected countries raised taxes and cut expenditures to battle the crisis which added to social unrest and confidence problems in their governments during this crisis several of these countries including greece portugal and ireland had their sovereign debt downgraded to junk by international credit rating agencies augmenting investor fears greece spain ireland portugal and cyprus were incapable of repaying or refinancing their government debt or bailing out their struggling banks without the help from third-party institutions such as the european central bank ecb the international monetary fund imf and the european financial stability facility efsf seventeen eurozone countries voted to create the efsf in 2010 specifically to resolve the european sovereign debt crisis these other eurozone countries were partially driven by desires to preserve the eurozone andor eu and partly driven by worries related to large investments by the banks in these healthier nations in the sovereign debt of the weaker nations some of these bank investments in risky sovereign debt were brought about in part by the low risk weights on this debt assigned by the basel ii capital requirements a number of parties are blamed for creating or exacerbating the effects of the global financial crisis and by implication the european sovereign debt crisis that followed in some cases the blame is not fully deserved either because the reasoning is incorrect or because the ex post consequences of some of the pre-crisis period actions could not be reasonably anticipated ex ante the federal reserve and its leaders receive blame for 1 keeping interest rates too low for too long in the pre-crisis period encouraging risky lending 2 not recognizing the dangers of the build-up of correlated risks in real estate lending 3 not devoting sufficient resources to their financial stability mission to identify future stability and systemic risk threats 4 pushing for basel ii capital standards which lowered requirements for large systemically important banking organizations and encouraged risky investments by european banks by putting low capital weights on aaa-rated tranches of mbs backed by subprime mortgages and sovereign debt of risky national governments 5 not regulating the new complex and opaque instruments of finance which were built on faulty models that underweighted the probability of housing price declines and 6 not applying safety and soundness and consumer protection regulations consistently across intermediaries which gave rise to regulatory arbitrage and 7 not pursuing accusations of consumer predatory lending blame is also often assigned to government sponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac which were undiversified entities that operated with very little capital and were able to borrow cheaply due to implicit government guarantees which were realized during the crisis with the backing of the us president george w bush and congress the gses began investing in subprime mbs during the pre-crisis period encouraging lenders to make more such loans in addition the securities and exchange commission sec is blamed for allowing the investment banks to operate with very low capital ratios despite very high portfolio risks in packaging and holding opaque mbs the investment banks that engaged in these risky activities are also held responsible for their behavior rating agencies are blamed for faulty ratings on mortgage-related securities in which additional aaa-ratings were assigned to riskier and more opaquetranches accounting firms are criticized for unrealistic values placed on opaque mbs mortgage bankers and underwriters are charged with overlooking unfavorable credit information and in some cases complicity in creating false favorable information finally a prior president and congress were blamed for allowing combinations of commercial and investment banks under the financial services modernization act of 1999 aka the grammleachbliley act we argue that this blame is misplaced given that the main financial institutions that created the crisis were not combined commercial banks and investment banks to the contrary one of the solutions to the crisis was to encourage such combinations because the stand-alone investment banks had significant liquidity problems during the crisis there are many other financial crises that are not discussed in this section in the interest of brevity we refer readers to literature that discusses these crises in detail for the us by berger and bouwman 2013 berger and bouwman 2016 berger and bouwman 2017 and worldwide by demirg-kuntdemirg-kunt and detragiache 1998 von hagen and ho 2007 reinhart and rogoff 2009 and laeven and valencia 2018 there are as many causes as there are financial crises and each one is different reinhart and rogoff 2009 so it is not possible to review all of the causes in the interest of brevity we focus here on just two recurring causeslending booms and liquidity buildups these two causes are not entirely independent as bank credit also creates liquidity for the economy it is often argued that unusually high quantities of bank lending and bank loan commitments may help result in financial crises loans are a form of on-balance sheet bank liquidity creation and loan commitments are a type of off-balance sheet bank liquidity creation berger and bouwman 2009 excessive credit of either type can result in asset price bubbles that burst and result in financial crises rajan 1994 acharya and naqvi 2012 brunnermeier gorton and krishnamurthy 2011 also argue that liquidity build-ups in the financial sector can create systemic risk the quality of credit issued may also significantly deteriorate during lending and liquidity booms because of an institutional memory problem in banks veteran loan officers may have difficulty remembering how to deal with problem loans when it has been a long time since they dealt with significant problems and turnover results in newer loan officers who have not previously faced such problems berger and udell 2004 in a theoretical setting thakor 2015a thakor 2016 show that good times corrupt risk management in banks and also lead to an underpricing of risk from an ex post perspective this is because an extended period of profitable bank growth may also create a false sense of security among bankers and regulators that banks can withstand significant shocks thakor 2015b excessive risk-taking may also occur off the balance sheet during economic booms as banks shy away from exercising material adverse change mac clauses on loan commitments1
due to reputational concerns during such booms thakor 2005 consistent with these views former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan argues that the worst loans are made at the top of the business cycle alan greenspan chicago bank structure conference may 10 2001 both excessive credit and poor quality of credit were evident in the us in the buildup to the global financial crisis subprime mortgages in great numbers were issued to overlevered consumers in some cases these mortgages were issued based on the optimistic assumption that housing prices would continue to rise given that many of the subprime borrowers would be unable to make the future payments without refinancing at higher home prices in addition fannie mae and freddie mac lowered their credit standards by buying subprime mortgages in the mid-2000s further encouraging banks to make such loans finally another reason for bank failures and crises is that regulatory career concerns may lead bank regulators to pursue self-interest and delay closures of financial institutions until things get really bad eg boot and thakor 1993 for the interest of brevity we review one empirical paper on lending booms and one on liquidity buildups both using us data dellariccia igan and laeven 2012 examine factors related to the rapid expansion of the us mortgage market prior to the global financial crisis using a large data set of loan applications they find that the denial rates were lower in areas that experienced faster credit demand growth and that lenders in these high-growth areas put less weight on applicants loan-to-income ratios after controlling for other economic fundamentals the other study explicitly tests the propositions that excessive on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity creation increase the likelihood of future financial crises berger and bouwman 2017 use data on five financial crises in the us they essentially use empirical models to predict when the fifth crisis the subprime crisis would occur controlling for a number of other aggregate factors that might cause financial crises they find that lagged detrended aggregate liquidity creation has a statistically and economically significantly positive effect on the probability of a future crisis supporting the theories discussed above they also find that the effects are primarily driven by off-balance sheet liquidity creation which is mostly composed of loan commitments as discussed above the distress of tbtf titf andor tmtf banks may trigger bailouts or bail-ins outside of crisis times the tbtf term was introduced in 1984 by the bailouts of continental illinois national bank and trust company which failed at that time but was not closed it was propped up by government bailouts for a number of years and was eventually bought by bank of america the chicago bank was the seventh largest bank in the us with about 40 billion in assets fdic 1997 and its failure was the largest in us history as of that time2
after continental illinois investors had reasons to believe that the creditors of large banks were likely to be protected in addition in congressional hearings after the event comptroller of the currency c todd conover the primary supervisor for national banks explicitly stated that regulators were unlikely to allow the nations 11 largest banks to fail3
congressman stewart mckinney responded let us not bandy words we have created a new kind of bank it is called too-big-to-fail tbtf and it is a wonderful bank this was the first time that government officials confirmed the existence of such a government policy tbtf theory describes the motivations of the regulators in bailing out tbtf banks and the incentives that the expectations of such bailouts create for the banks and their stakeholders regulators bailout decisions may be motivated by the desires to reduce damages to the financial system and the real economy the failure of a large bank may spill over to other financial institutions and increase the likelihood of future financial crises supporting this acharya 2009 finds that the limited liability of banks and the presence of a negative externality of one banks failure on the health of other banks give rise to a systemic risk-shifting incentive where all banks undertake correlated investments thereby increasing economy-wide aggregate risk the loss of credit and other banking services of a single large bank may also cause significant economic losses in addition they may bail out large banks to avoid personal embarrassment about failures on their watches or to direct credit according to their preferences eg kane 1989 kane 1991 stern and feldman 2004 mishkin and eakins 2006 the expectation that the largest banks are likely to be bailed out in the event of their distress from tbtf policies is a subsidy to large banks in conditions of financial distress and good financial health as well because the lessened probability of failure allows the large banks to raise equity and debt capital more cheaply this motivates the banks to become larger to be able to raise capital more cheaply and motivates shareholders creditors and other counterparties to do business with them eg cetorelli and traina 2018 
table 21
provides some data indicating how large banks have grown since the tbtf policy was introduced in 1984 the number of fdic insured banks has fallen by about 70 as of 2019q1 while the number of banks with at least 10 billion in assets has increased by about 340 and their share of industry assets has more than tripled of course both inflation and real growth of banks play roles in these figures but it seems likely that tbtf be responsible for some of the growth of the large banks the theoretical motivations behind titf and tmtf mostly follow those of tbtf they also involve regulators avoiding risks to the financial system and the economy circumventing personal embarrassment andor maintaining the ability to direct credit and banks and their stakeholders taking actions to gain the subsidies of bailout expectations titf theory differs from tbtf theory in that it takes into account the highly interconnected network among banks rather than the size of these institutions banks may be interconnected either directly or indirectly direct interconnectedness arises from bilateral transactions or relationships between banks such as interbank deposits loans or derivatives eg interest rate swaps if the bank that owes money or is out-of-the-money on derivative contracts becomes financial distressed or fails the banks with direct interconnections to it suffer losses on the values of their claims losing all of the values in the event of failure indirect interconnectednessin which the financial distress or failure of a bank may spread losses to banks without direct bilateral exposures to itstems from many potential sources these include mark-to-market losses on similar assets margin calls andor increased haircuts on posted collateral triggered by fire sales by other banks or information spillovers from other banks that result in runs eg lui quiet and roth 2015 under titf theory the financial distress or failure of more interconnected banks causes more damage to the financial system than problems of less interconnected institutions thus regulators are more likely to bail out more interconnected banks and banks have incentives to become more interconnected to increase their likelihoods of receiving such bailouts the theoretical arguments in choi 2014 suggest that bailouts be allocated to the stronger of the interconnected banks who are in better positions to reduce systemic risk than the weaker banks tmtf theory posits a more dynamic view that includes multiple banks holding the total number of banks constant for a period of time when the number of failed banks increases and the number of surviving banks decreases the investment opportunity set for surviving financial institutions grows large but the total investment capacity of surviving banks decreases acharya and yorulmazer 2007 to prevent widespread damage the optimal choice for regulator is to bail out when the number of failures is large the expectations of such widespread bailouts may encourage banks to engage in herding behavior that results in highly correlated portfolios to be able to benefit from future bailouts eg acharya and yorulmazer 2007 acharya and yorulmazer 2008 brown and din 2011 farhi and tirole 2012 acharya et al 2016 perhaps surprisingly some empirical research suggests that the asset similarity created by tmtf may actually reduce systemic risk because the market expects banks with greater similarities to be more likely to survive during financial crises cai 2019 in this section we focus on what might cause tbtf titf andor tmtf banks to become financially distressed and potentially fail that would result in bailouts or bail-ins most of the studies on the determinants of bank problems focus on bank failure rather than financial distress and so we review the bank failure literature presumably the factors that bring about financial distress are largely in common with those that cause failure given that banks usually fail before a period of financial distress most of the literature on bank failure concentrates on accounting variables virtually all such studies find that low capital ratios raise the probability of bank failure other weak accounting performance measures such as low profitability and poor loan quality raise the probability of failure as do certain activities commercial real estate credit particularly construction and development loans and nontraditional activities eg lane et al 1986 cole and gunther 1995 cole and gunther 1998 wheelock and wilson 1995 wheelock and wilson 2000 calomiris and mason 1997 calomiris and mason 2003 elsinger et al 2006 schaeck 2008 cole and white 2012 knaup and wagner 2012 admati et al 2013 berger and bouwman 2013 deyoung and torna 2013 berger et al 2016 sampling a few of these studies cole and gunther 1995 find that capital troubled assets and net income are key indicators in explaining bank failure berger and bouwman 2013 find that low capital ratios reduce the probability of survival for small banks under all general economic conditionsbanking crises market crises and normal timeswhile low capital hurts medium and large banks primarily during the banking crises schaeck 2008 finds that liability structure affects a banks time to failure fee-based nontraditional activities eg securities brokerage and insurance sales decrease and asset-based nontraditional activities eg venture capital investment banking and asset securitization increase the probability of distressed bank failure deyoung and torna 2013 some also find that commercial real estate loans particularly real estate construction and development loans play important recurring roles in explaining bank failure eg fenn and cole 2008 cole and white 2012 in addition some composite measures of bank soundness or risks forecast bank failure including the traditional measure of bank soundness camels components cole and white 2012 and a market-based measure of credit portfolio quality and bank performance credit risk indicator cri knaup and wagner 2012 others focus on corporate governance with mixed results on both bank performance and failure eg fahlenbrach and stulz 2011 beltratti and stulz 2012 berger and bouwman 2013 berger et al 2016 calomiris and carlson 2016 one study also finds that bank cost inefficiency during normal times a signal of poor management predicts both performance problems and failure during subsequent financial crises assaf berger roman and tsonias 2019  experimental work and research effect of acupuncture on uncoupling protein 1 gene expression for brown adipose tissue of obese rats zhi-cheng liu sun feng-min dong-hong zhao zhong-cheng zhang hai-tao wu bing-guo xu zhu miao-hua  chao-jun li  objective to explore the effects of acupuncture on the expression of uncoupling protein 1 ucp1 gene of brown adipose tissue bat in obese rats methods the expression of ucp1 gene of bat was determined with rt-pcr technique the changes of body weight lees index body fat and the expression of ucp1 gene of bat in obese rats were observed before and after acupuncture results the body weight lees index body fat in obese rats were all markedly higher than those in normal rats but the expression of ucp gene of bat in obese rats was all lower than that in normal rats there were negative correlation between the obesity index and the expression of ucp1 gene in bat after acupuncture the marked effect of weight loss was achieved while the expression of ucp gene of bat obviously increased in obese rats conclusion the abnormal reduction for expression of ucpa gene of bat might be an important cause for the obesity to promote the expression of ucp in obese organism might be an important cellular and molecular mechanism in anti-obesity effect by acupuncture  in recent years studies showed that obesity involves a series of dietary controlling and metabolic disorders caused by specific biochemical factor and its pathogenesis process is very complicated at present obesity has already become the main killer threatening human health in place of former illnesses induced by malnutrition and infection therefore its pathogenesis and treatment has become the focus in the concern of current world medicine and a hot point for contemplation there has been no breakthrough in treatment on obesity and ideal non-toxic medicine without any adverse reaction is still under exploration the author established an approach of acupuncture in treating obesity and its complications the effect of which proved long-lasting without any toxic and adverse reaction and was welcomed by the vast obesity patients 1 this study has explored the effect of acupuncture on the uncoupling protein 1 ucp1 gene expression of brown adipose tissue bat in obesity organisms and now is reported

would show the difference between the changes of sample ucp mrna expression spss software was used to analyze the experimental data for the comparison between groups t test was adopted and multivariate analysis was adopted for correlation analysis see table 1  from table 1 we could see that the body weight and lees index of model rats were all obviously higher than the level of normal rats and after the treat-ment of acupuncture the body weight and lees index obviously reduced the difference being significant statistically p001 table 2 showed the adipose amount at the 3 locations of control group rats were all higher-than that of normal rats and that of acupuncture group rats were significantly lower than that of control the difference being significant statistically p001 table 3 showed that the rats bat ucp13-actin ratio of control group was significantly reduced and when compared with normal group the difference was significant p 001  acupuncture group rats bat ucp113-actin ratio was obviously elevated and when compared with control group the difference was significant p005  compared with normal group the difference was also significant p005 it denoted that the effect of acupuncture on obese organism bat ucpi gene expression was up-regulated  the results showed that the rats bat ucp1 gene expression level with body weight lees index and amount of body fat were--0 706 --0 559 --0 618 respectively all displaying negative correlation indicating that the more obese the organism the lower the bat ucp1 gene expression level recent study showed that the pathogenesis of obesity is correlated with multiple factors such as hereditary gene environmental factor dietary structure etc among them the chief deciding factor is gene 6 ucp is a specific expressed mitochondria intimal protein of bat with its molecular weight as 32kd 7 the function of ucp is a transportation carrier of fatty acid ion which carries from inside the mitochondria to outside mitochondria the fatty acid ion that can not penetrate the mitochondria intima the fatty acid ion outside the mitochondria would combine with h  and re-enter the mitochondria and is again reoxidized to fatty acid ion such repetition would eliminate different concentration gradients on both sides of mitochondria intima induced by oxidation so that adp cannot be phosphorylated to generate atp the final results of respiratory and oxidized phosphorylation uncoupling would bring about the transformation of energy production to 9 207 9 heat production 8 at present there have been discovered 3 kinds of ucp ucp1 ucpz and ucp3 ucpi is the earliest discovered uncoupling protein and in bat expression in rodent animal it is an important uncoupling protein of non-shivering heat production ucp2 not only exists in bat but existed widely in various tissues and cells including white adipose tissue lung liver spleen and inside macrophage ucp3 mainly exists in skeletal muscle and also in bat studies showed that ucpz and ucp3 are uncoupling protein with the same function as ucp1 9m it is well known that ucp gene expression level plays the deciding role in its own content and bat heat production which is called the center of bat heat production heat production is closely related with energy balance metabolism and body weight regulation the important protein participating in metabolism under normal physiologic status most likely also participates in the target protein of patho-physiologic metabolic disturbance and therefore it is inferred that ucps possibly are related with obesity pathogenesis the results of the present study showed that obese rats displayed characteristics of overeating overdrinking and their heavy weight lees index and body fat were obviously higher than normal at the same time the obese rats bat ucp1 gene expression level showed lower than that of normal rats which is to say the obese rats bat ucp1 transcription level was abnormally reduced correlation analysis revealed that the obese rats bat ucp1 gene expression level and body weight lees index and amount of body fat showed negative correlation this result showed that bat ucp gene expression was abnormally decreased its heat production and energy consumption weakened which is sure to cause obesity it is known that ucps gene expression is regulated by multiple factors such as certain central nervous system nucleus group sympathetic nerve endocrine factors etc noradrenaline thyroxin corticosteroid leptin lp and insulin ins etc could stimulate the fat of adipose cell to disintegrate and produce heat this function mainly would be realized through 133-adrenergic receptor 133-ar na and 133-ar combined together could precisely regulate ucp1 gene expression and transform pro-adipose cell into bat cell owing to the increase of mitochondria and cell count ucp1 could increase nas promotion of ucp gene expression also can elevate the synthesis of camp related to g coupling protein the latter could activate the proteinkinase pka which in turn acted on the target protein including corticosteroid cs sensitive lipase when this enzyme was activated by phosphorylation it could inhibit the storage of triglyceride so as to disintegrate the fat and increase the free fatty acid the target protein of pka also includes camp reaction element protein and it might promote the transcription of ucps gene to raise the heat production and energy consumption 12-5 our previous research work revealed that the balance index of vegetative nerve of obese patients is abnormally reduced with their sympathetic mediator na adrenaline and dopamine da concentration extremely low and their parasympathic nerve function index salivary amylase s-am and blood acetylcholinesterase ache  extraordinarily elevated at the same time obese patients plasma camp thyroxin corticosteroid noradrenaline adrenaline and adrenoeorticotropic hormone content were all very low and serum lp and ins content abnormally raised animal experiments indicated that the obese rats bat cell volume increased full fatty drops large mitochondria in the cytoplasm obviously reduced in size mitochondria matrix density increased the crista unable to be clearly displayed and interstitial capillary decreased showing that bat heat production was abnormally decreased another experiment displayed that the serum lp and ins content of obese rats ab-normally increased which denoted that there existed leptinemia and hyperinsulinemia as well as leptin resistance lr and insulin resistance ir in obese organisms at the same time the hypothalamic lp and ins content of obese rats were abnormally low denoting that the lp blood brain transportation abnormality was likely to be one of the important factors of lr experiment showed that the number of rbcs insulin receptor insr of high affinity and low volume and that of low affinity and high volume in obese rats was all decreased but the dissociation constant in insr of high or low affinity was abnormally elevated which denoted that obese organisms insr abnormality and ins blood brain transportation abnormality were possibly one of the important factors of ir 116 the above-mentioned data showed that the abnormal lowering of obese organisms bat ucps gene expression level was possibly related with abovementioned regulating factors the present study showed that after acupuncture the obese rats body weight lees index and body fat all markedly reduced denoting that acupuncture does have beneficial fat reducing effect at the same time the bat ucp1 gene expression level markedly increased i e  acupuncture could up-regulate bat ucp mrna level and elevate the effect of ucp1 and therefore the energy consumption and heat production increased finally obtaining the fat reduction efficacy in summary abnormal decrease of biologic organisms bat ucp1 gene expression level is possibly the important cause of obesity the promotion of obese organisms bat ucp1 gene expression by acupuncture is possibly one of the cellular biological mechanisms in weight-reducing by acupuncture  668-671 acta scientiarum naturalium universitatis nankaiensis yuan yuhua b changhao i ju li xueqian wang yunqi geng chen qimin  the failed attempt to express hiv-gp41 in e coli led to the investigation of hiv-gp41 segments which is responsible for the toxicity to e coli cells a series of deletion mutants containing different regions of gp41 gene were constructed and expressed in e coli bl21de3 strain after iptg induction the high mortality of host bacteria was observed in host bacteria carrying the deletion mutants of gp41 gene except for those transformed with pet-hn2 coordinately the mrna transcripts of the gp41 was rapidly decreased and the release of ehuridine increased upon induction all these data suggested that gp41 protein has a cytotoxic effect on e coli and it is the cytotoxicity of the gp41 gene product that contributes to the high mortality when expressed in e coli  coli expression systems it has been suggested that the cytotoxicity of gp41 protein to e coli is the main factor hindering gp41 expression l  the special topological structure of the viral transmembrane protein may attribute to the cytotoxicity and dominate the fate of the proteins expressed in e coli for example semliki forest virus 6 k protein protein 3ab of hepatitis a virus and protein e of sars 2 3 4 could be expressed effectively in e coli but hepatitis c virus el protein ns2b protein of japanese encephalitis virus and rotavirus nsp4 proteins-7 could not the transmembrane proteins function via their hydrophobicity and formation of a-helix the transmembrane helix is inserted into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayers by hydrophobic force from hydrophobic amino acids this insertion raises a perturbation and makes the lipid bilayers irregularly rearranged to complete the transmembrane procedure our previous studyl showed that gp41 contains two transmembrane a-helices the first one is formed by amino-acid residues 4-16 and the second one by 167-189 resudues segments nl and n3 of gp41 each containing one of the trasmembrane a-helices could not be expressed effectively in e coli where as segment n2 which contains no transmembrane a-helices could be successfully produced by investigating the expression level of different gp41 segments as well as their cytotoxicity in e coli we have determined the cause for the failed gp41 expression in e coli this paper establishes the base for the further exploration of the effectors of gp41 protein in hiv pathology 1 materials and methods  i materials plasmids pet-hgp41 pet-hnl pet-hn2 pet-hn3 and pet-hc were constructed as described previously 9 i the loci of segments nl n2 n3 c in gp41 gene are shown in fig 1  ii gene manipulation plasmids transformation rna extraction probe hybridization were performed as described in ref 10  iii preparation of dna probe segments nl and c of gp41 gene were labelled by a-32 pdatpdctp as probe nl and c iv growth curve of bacteria pet-hn3 pet-hc were transformed into e coli bl21de3 single clones of bl21de3 cells containing the indicated plasmid were grown overnight at 37c in lb medium in the presence of ampicillin at 100 mgml then the cells were diluted 100-fold in lb medium supplemented with the antibiotics and grown at 37c respectively once the cultures reached an a 600 of about 08 they were induced by the addition of 1 mmolll of isopropylthiogalactopyranoside iptg and plotted against a600 at given times  v comparison of the survival rate of bacteria cells were grown as described above and once a600  05 they were induced by adding 1 mmolll iptg and diluted aliquots of cultures were spread on lb solid plate at given times and the clones were counted after incubation for 18 hat 37c vi uridine loading of e coli cells cells were grown as described above incubated with 2 mci of eh uridine for 1 h before induction the cells were sedimented and washed twice with the uridine-free prewarmed growth medium then the cells were resuspended in the initial volume of the growth medium and incubated at 37 c fifteen minutes later the cells were induced with iptg samples are taken at the given times and 02-ml supernatant is used to quantify the radioactivity released to the medium the results represent the mean of triplicated experiments cv15 vii rna dot blotting the overnight culture of bacteria containing pet-hgp41 pet-hnl pet-hn2 pet-hn3 pet-hc were diluted 100-fold and continued to grow at 37c

respectively the total rna was extracted from each sample 20 flg total rna were dotted on a nitro cellulase membrane pre-hybridized for 2 h then hybridized with probe nl and c overnight at 68 c respectively after drying membranes were exposed to x-ray films kodak at -70 c overnight  i  expression of gp41 segments affects the growth of host bacterium in order to understand the effect of expression of different segments of gp41 gene on bacterial growing a600 of the host bacteria at given times was measured and plotted fig 2  e coli bi21 de3 with pet-h and pet-hn2 had an increase in a 600  but the  ii expression of gp41 of some segments is lethal to the host counting the survival rate of bacterium induced showed that bacterium with pet-hgp41 pet-hnl pet-hn3 and pet-hc has a high death rate as the counts decrease from about 10 8 to 10 5 ml during 4 h but bacteriums carrying pet-hn2 were relatively viable fig 3  iii segments of gp41 permeabilize bl21de3 cells membrane in order to understand the reason for host bacteria death caused by expression of gp41 segments ehuridine release assay was performed to measure the cytotoxicity of gp41 protein to host bacteria cells in fig 4  expression of segments of gp41 led to eh uridine release from the host bacterium more or less cpm from 67 to 163 in 5 h the data showed that the expression of the segments permeabilizes host bacteria cells membrane and leads to cytotoxicity from fig 4  gp41 showed the highest permeability 163 cpm while n2 though expressed well also permeablizes host membrane iv transcript of some gp41 mutants decreases rapidly after induction rna dot blotting assay was used to measure transcript of segments of gp41 gene in fig 5  mrna transcript of the segments except for n2 decreased rapidly following iptg induction especially the fulllength gp41 gene the results suggested that the expression of various segments causes different levels of permeability to cell membrane and the rise of permeability leads to bacteria death and a rapid mrna transcript decrease in brief the cytotoxicity of gp41 protein to bacteria cell membrane results in the low survival rate of host bacteria in which the gp41 is expressed analyses of n -terminal segments of gp41 reveal that segment n2 contains a leucine zipper structure and an a-helix region which may also permeabilize cells membrane ll  however because the hydrophobicity of n2 is lower than that of nl and n3 its cytotoxicity is lower therefore it can be expressed effectively 26 residues at n-terminal of segment nl are fusion peptide of gp41 protein and are mainly composed of hydrophobic residues 670 its function is to induce fusion of hiv envelop with host cell membrane segment n3 is mainly composed of hydrophobic amino acid too and its function is to anchor gp41 protein on hiv envelop and host cell membrane hydrophobic amino acids bring a perturbation effect on hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers when embedded in membrane thus causing cytotoxicity on cells 8  because segments nl and n3 have higher hydrophobicity than n2 does they may have stronger cytotoxicity therefore they are expressed less effectively in host bacteria there are two lentivirus lysis peptide llp llpi and llp2 in segment c llp can be folded into the amphipathic ahelix structure which contains abundant arginine and the hydrophilic arginine may change cell membranes structure and function it is speculated that the arginines in segment c are the main reason for cytotoxicity to cell  edward 7 found that the expression of the rotavirus nonstructural glycoprotein nsp4 in e coli leads to a decrease in optical density of the culture and release of eh uridine into the medium and the nsp4 contains abundant lysines in the membrane-spanning-proximal region ciccaglione 5 found that hepatitis c virus el protein membrane-spanning hydrophobic region and arginine-339 and lysine-370 of membrane-spanning-proximal region have cytotoxicity effect on e coli chang 6 found that the deletion of 6 residues lkttkr of ns2b c-terminal protein in japanese encephalitis virus may alleviate its cytotoxicity cole 12 have studied antibacterial activity of peptides derived from envelop glycoproteins of hiv-l and found that membrane-spanning domain of gp41 protein and two 15residue peptide derived from llpi have antibacterial activity though the antibacterial action occurred in vitro it is likely that there would be a common mechanism involved in gp41 proteins cytotoxicity in vivo in our experiment u sing different assays we have found that gp41 protein permeabilizes cell membrane and kills most bacteria this may attribute to the difficulty of its expression in e coli in addition among all the gp41 gene segments only segment n2 can be expressed effectively in e coli with a few cells dead this reported data suggest that the hydrophobicity of protein and positively charged arg may be the major factor for their cytotoxicity  leit the

tumours derived from pancreatic beta-cells the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor glp-1r is expressed with a high incidence 90 and high density in insulinomas glucagon-like peptide 1 glp-1 the natural ligand of glp-1r is rapidly degraded in vivo a more stable agonist of glp-1r is exendin-3 we investigated imaging of insulinomas with dota-conjugated exendin-3 labelled with 68ga methods targeting of insulinomas with lys40dotaexendin-3 labelled with either 111in or 68ga was investigated in vitro using insulinoma tumour cells ins-1 lys40111in-dtpaexendin-3 was used as a reference in this study in vivo targeting was investigated in balbc nude mice with subcutaneous ins-1 tumours pet imaging was performed using a preclinical petct scanner results in vitro exendin-3 specifically bound and was internalized by glp-1r-positive cells in balbc nude mice with subcutaneous ins-1 tumours a high uptake of lys40111in-dtpaexendin-3 in the tumour was observed 335 - 116idg at 4 h after injection uptake was specific as determined by coinjection of an excess of unlabelled lys40exendin-3 18 - 01idg the pancreas also exhibited high and specific uptake 113 - 10idg high uptake was also found in the kidneys 144 - 24idg and this uptake was not receptor-mediated in this murine tumour model optimal targeting of the glp-1r expressing tumour was obtained at exendin doses  or 01 microg remarkably tumour uptake of 68ga-labelled lys40dotaexendin-3 was lower 89 - 31idg than tumour uptake of 111in-labelled lys40dtpaexendin-3 254 - 72idg the subcutaneous tumours were clearly visualized by small-animal pet imaging after injection of 3 mbq of lys4068ga-dotaexendin-3 conclusion lys4068ga-dotaexendin-3 specifically accumulates in insulinomas although the uptake is lower than that of lys40111in-dtpaexendin-3 therefore lys4068ga-dotaexendin-3 is a promising tracer to visualize insulinomas with pet brom maarten  oyen wim j g  joosten lieke  gotthardt martin  boerman otto c characterization of ace and ace2 expression within different organs of the nod mouse heleia roca-ho marta riera vanesa palau julio pascual maria soler jose joseph moxon v   angiotensin converting enzyme ace2 is an enzymatically active ace homologue which shares 42 of its amino acidic sequence identity in its catalytic domain however ace and ace2 show several differences whereas ace is a dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase presenting both n- and c-terminus catalytic domains with two zinc-binding motifs hexxh where x is any amino acid ace2 is a monocarboxypeptidase with only one zinc-binding motif at its n-terminal domain 123 through this catalytic domain ace2 hydrolyzes angii angiotensin ii to generate ang17 a peptide that binds to the mas receptor ang1-7 receptor and activates vasodilation anti-fibrosis anti-proliferation and anti-inflammatory effects as well as counterbalances the ace-angii-atr1 axis actions 456 renin angiotensin system ras was classically described as a regulation system responsible for blood pressure regulation electrolyte and fluid homeostasis exerting most of its actions through kidneys 7 later on its elements were also found in extrarenal tissues indicating the presence of a local paracrine system that coexists with the circulating ras 8 thus ace expression was mainly found in the surface of endothelial cells of lungs renal brush border membranes intestines choroid plexus placenta 91011 and to a lesser extent in cardiac hepatic pancreatic and adrenal tissues 12 in contrast ace2 protein expression was initially reported to be more tissue restricted and higher than ace being described preferentially in kidneys renal tubules and glomeruli heart and testis 13 subsequently ace2 expression was also found widespread in many other organs such as lungs pancreas 1415 bladder stomach ileum adipocytes and liver 1617 ras activation is known to play a key role in several diseases namely diabetes and renal and cardiovascular pathologies 1819 ace2 and ace enzymes have found to be altered in the kidney from different diabetic experimental models the dbdb type 2 and streptozotozin stz type 1 diabetic mice 202122 however ace2 and ace enzymes have not been extensively studied in other tissues from diabetic mice the non-obese diabetic nod mice is a strain that spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes that mimics type 1 diabetes in humans 2324 we hypothesized that ace2 and ace enzymes are present in different tissues other than kidney and differentially expressed in addition the administration of insulin can alter ace2 and ace expression within these tissues from nod mice for this purpose we studied both ace and ace2 activities as well as their protein expression in several tissues from nod diabetic mice we also analyzed the effect of diabetes on ace2 and ace modifications in tissues from nod diabetic mice as compared to non-obese resistant nor mice in addition we assessed the effect of insulin administration on ace2 and ace expression in the studied tissues ace enzymatic determination technique was set up using two buffers for this study human recombinant ace hrace was used phosphate buffer pb and borate buffer bb were incubated with increasing amounts of hrace figure 1a we observed that ace activity at lower hrace amounts was only detected by the use of bb in addition the hrace activity measurement was found to be linear with bb as compared to pb pb needed higher amounts of hrace for its detection suggesting a lower sensitivity when this buffer was used after the above-mentioned experiments we decided to use bb for our ace activity assays the next step was to test the optimal amounts of tissue protein for ace activity measurements figure 1bc increasing amounts of protein for each tissue of both control cont dashed lines and diabetic db continuous lines mice were used pulmonary tissue presented a linear enzymatic activity in both cont and db mice due to its high enzymatic activity figure 2b in contrast no linearity in increasing amounts of heart triangle pancreas circle and liver cross samples due to the low ace activity detection was observed figure 1c furthermore it is worth noting that ace activity in db was higher as compared to cont and lung presented the highest levels of ace activity ace2 enzymatic activity was already previously established and validated in our laboratory by using a specific ace2 quenched fluorogenic substrate 252627 the optimal amount of each studied tissue was determined by reactions with increasing amounts of protein in pulmonary cardiac hepatic and pancreatic tissues of both cont and db samples figure 2 higher ace2 activity was observed in lung heart liver and pancreas from cont mice with increased amounts of protein interestingly increased levels of enzymatic activities were found in tissue samples from db mice as compared to controls among all studied tissues pancreas presented higher levels of ace2 activity followed by heart lung and liver in serum samples ace activity was significantly increased in db at early and late stages of diabetes as compared to cont mice p  004 in 21-day follow up and p  00003 in 40-day follow up insulin administration slightly decreased circulating ace activity in db mice at both early and late stages p  ns not significant figure 3a ace activity was significantly increased in lungs from db mice at early and late stages of diabetes as compared to cont mice p  0045 and p  0026 respectively insulin administration did not modify ace activity in lungs from db as compared to cont mice p  ns figure 3b regarding heart samples no statistically significant differences were observed in ace activity in db as compared to their respective cont mice p  ns furthermore no significant effect was observed in cardiac tissue after insulin treatment in db as compared to cont mice p  ns figure 3c ace activity was also tested in liver as observed in heart no differences in ace activity levels between db and cont mice were found in liver tissue p  ns no changes were observed after insulin administration p  ns figure 3c no significant differences in ace activity levels were found in pancreas from db and cont mice p  ns figure 3c in serum samples there was a significant increase of ace2 activity in db mice at early and late stages of diabetes as compared to cont p  00003 and p  00003 respectively and insulin administration significantly decreased ace2 activity in db mice at early and late stages p  0001 and p  0001 respectively figure 4a in lung homogenates no changes were observed between db and cont mice p  ns interestingly insulin administration significantly increased ace2 activity in db mice at late stage as compared to db mice p  005 figure 4b at cardiac level there was a significant increase of ace2 activity in db mice in both early and late stages of db as compared to cont mice p  0011 and p  0029 respectively however insulin administration did not modify this pattern p  ns figure 4b in liver samples no changes were observed between the studied groups figure 4b pancreatic ace2 activity was increased in db mice as compared to cont mice p  0014 in 21-day follow up and p  00003 in 40-day follow up of study in addition insulin administration did not change ace2 activity in pancreas from db mice p  ns figure 4b after ace and ace2 activities were measured ace2ace activity ratios were calculated for each studied tissue to infer the status of ras in different tissues as an ace-ace2 balance in serum samples ace2ace activity ratio in db mice at early and late stages was higher as compared to cont p  0011 and p  00003 respectively insulin administration significantly decreased circulating ace2ace activity ratio in db mice p  0001 figure 5a in lung there were no differences in ace2ace activity ratio between the db and cont groups at early stage interestingly ace2ace activity ratio was significantly decreased in db at late stage as compared to cont mice p  0001 insulin administration significantly increased ace2ace activity ratio in db mice p  0014 figure 5b at cardiac level ace2ace activity ratio was significantly increased in db mice in both early and late stages as compared to cont mice p  00003 and p  0008 respectively but insulin administration had no effect on ace2ace activity in db figure 5c in pancreas ace2ace activity ratio was significantly increased in db mice in both early and late stages as compared to cont mice p  005 and p  0001 respectively but insulin administration had no effect on ace2ace activity in db figure 5 panel c in liver there were no differences in ace2ace activity ratio in db as compared to their respective cont p  ns insulin administration did not modify ace2ace activity in liver figure 5c to assess ace protein expression immunoblotting techniques were performed in lungs ace protein expression was significantly increased in db mice at early and late stages as compared to cont p  0008 and p  0012 respectively in addition insulin administration significantly decreased ace protein expression in db mice p  005 and p  0024 respectively figure 6a in heart ace protein expression was significantly increased in db mice at late stage as compared to cont p  003 figure 6b insulin administration did not modify ace protein expression in liver and pancreas there were no differences between db and cont mice figure 6c in lungs ace2 protein expression was significantly increased in db mice at early stage as compared to cont mice p  0008 in addition insulin administration significantly decreased ace2 protein expression in db mice p  005 figure 6a in heart ace2 protein expression was significantly increased in db mice at early stage as compared to cont mice p  0022 and p  0035 respectively insulin administration did not modify ace2 protein expression in db mice p  ns figure 6b in liver ace2 protein expression was significantly increased in db mice at late stage as compared to cont mice p  0008 and insulin administration did not modify ace2 protein expression figure 6c in pancreas there were no changes observed when ace2 protein expression was studied figure 6d mean blood glucose levels in control animals were 16025  947 mgdl at the end of the study in diabetic animals blood glucose levels were significantly increased to 550  3308 mgdl in animals followed for 21 days and 555  347 mgdl in the animals followed for 40 days insulin pellets significantly reduced blood glucose levels at 11065  11 mgdl and 9767 948 mgdl for 21 and 40 days of diabetes respectively blood glucose levels positively correlated with ace2ace ratio in serum r  0455 p  0003 and negatively correlated with ace2ace ratio in lung r  0546 p  00005 several works have been focused on the study of ace and ace2 enzymes within the diabetic kidney 2128 ace2 has been shown to be increased in the kidney from different models of diabetic nephropathy the stz-diabetic model and the non-obese diabetic mice nod among others 2025 however in other tissues from diabetic animals such as liver and heart ace and ace2 enzymes have not been widely studied in the present study we demonstrated that ace and ace2 activities are present in different tissues interestingly their expression is different depending on the tissue ace is highly expressed in lung whereas ace2 is highly expressed in pancreas among the studied tissues we also observed that diabetes up-regulated ace and ace2 activity and protein expression in the majority of the studied tissues a large number of ace activity detection techniques have been described such as radioassays high-performance liquid chromatography and colorimetric-based assays 293031 of note that ace activity measurement based on fluorimetric quantification is the most widely used technique because of its sensitivity simplicity speed and high reproducibility 32 in 1971 cushman and cheung developed an ace activity assay using synthetic ace-specific substrates including one of the substrates most commonly cited in literature hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine hhl 33 as an indirect determination this technique is based on the hydrolysis of hhl and the measurement of fluorescence through the o-phthalaldialdehyde adducts formation with hhl 34 in this work ace activity was indirectly measured using hhl as the substrate for ace as previously described previous studies have shown that ace activity from the same samples differs depending on the homogenization buffer used 3235 we now show that borate buffer is the most suitable to detect lower levels of ace activity showing better linearity conferring less variability and offering a more reliable assay our results showed that ace activity in lungs was higher as compared to other studied tissues moreover a significant increase was observed in serum and lung from diabetic mice at early and late stages as compared to control mice the same pattern was observed when ace protein expression was studied these observations are consistent with previous studies from huang and co-authors showing increased ace activity in plasma and mrna levels in lung from stz-induced diabetic c57bl6 mice 36 thus there is a coupled serum and pulmonary alteration in ace activity suggesting that pulmonary and circulating ras may exert a common regulation since ras has a key role in cardiovascular diseases recent studies have associated ras with liver fibrosis cirrhosis and portal pressure regulation 37 interestingly pancreas is found to express local ras the role of ras components in diabetes have been previously studied 152538 in addition ace was also increased in liver from db mice at late stage of follow-up we found that ace activity was decreased in heart from db mice but only at early stage however in previous studies by colucci and co-authors there were no differences between control and diabetic mice 12 in all studied tissues the insulin-treated group presented no significant differences compared to the non-treated diabetic group ace2 enzyme a novel ace homologue was discovered in the last decade 12 for years the detection of endogenous ace2 activity in mouse tissues was difficult and ace2 activity assay is a relatively recent reliable technique 3940 ace2 activity was performed in serum lung heart liver pancreas and kidney tissues by measuring the hydrolysis of mca-apkdnp a quenched-fluorescent specific ace2-substrate our findings showed that ace2 activity levels were higher in pancreas as compared to other studied tissues interestingly significant increases in serum pancreas and heart in ace2 activity from nod diabetic mice as compared to nor mice at 21 and at 40 days after the onset of diabetes were observed in addition ace2 activity was also increased in liver at 40 days of diabetes in nod mice with regard to protein expression ace2 expression levels were increased in lungs and heart at early stage of diabetes and in pancreas at late stage of diabetes previous studies postulated that the differences observed in ace2 activities are related to adam17 sheddase activity 41 however no differences were found when studying ace2 and adam17 activities and gene expression in pancreas islet from dbdb mice as compared to the respective dbm controls 42 it is of note that insulin administration mainly restored ace and ace2 and ace2ace ratio activities in serum samples at longer time of follow-up however these results were not consistent in other tissues these findings may be ascribed to the direct correlation observed between glucose levels and ace2ace ratio thus the results observed may indicate in part a protective effect of insulin on normalizing circulating ras activities in conclusion we assessed ace and ace2 activities in different tissues of nod mice and demonstrated that ace activity is highly detected in lungs whereas ace2 activity is highly detected in pancreas in diabetic mice there is a coupled serum and pulmonary alteration in ace activity that suggests that pulmonary and circulating ras may exert a common regulation the increase of ace2 activity within the circulation in diabetic mice may be related to a compensatory ras mechanism nodshiltj and norltj female mice from the jackson laboratory bar harbor me usa were housed in cages under 12 h lightdark cycle in a specific pathogen germ free spf environment female mice only were used because the development of diabetes is more predictable in female than in male nod mice 43 mice were fed with a chow diet and were provided access to tap water ad libitum the ethical committee of animal experimentation of the barcelona biomedical research park ceea-prbb mso-08-1106 and the catalan government dmah 4097 approved this study mice had their blood glucose levels determined every two weeks starting at 10 weeks of age fasting blood samples from tail vein were obtained and used for glucose level determination with the accu-chek compact roche st cugat spain female nod mice were considered diabetic when glucose blood level higher than 250 mgdl was first detected nod diabetic mice were randomly assigned to two groups without db or with insulin treatment db  ins for blood glucose levels control insulin pellets 01 u24 hrpellet linbit linshin canada inc toronto canada were subcutaneously implanted under anesthesia with ketamine and medetomidine after surgery atipamezol was injected to revert the effects of medetomidine diabetic animals were compared to the non-diabetic strain nor cont studied animals were weekly controlled for body weight and glucose blood levels and were followed for 21 and 40 days after diabetes diagnosis and then final surgery was performed the total number of animals included in each study group were the following eight animals in each cont group seven animals in each db group and five animals were studied for 21 days with insulin pellet and six animals for 40 days with insulin treatment studies were performed in serum heart lungs liver and pancreas animals were sacrificed under anesthesia with pentobarbital blood samples were obtained by intracardiac puncture and organs were next perfused with phosphate-buffered saline pbs solution by transcardiac puncture serum was obtained after 10 min of centrifugation at 6000 g and stored at 80 c tissues were quickly removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen they were then stored at 80 c until use ace activity was first set up using human recombinant ace hrace and for this reason two different buffers were used with increasing concentrations of recombinant one buffer contained 05 m potassium phosphate pb ph 83 34 and the other was a mix of 04 m borate buffer bb ph 72 034 m sucrose and 09 m nacl 32 after that increasing amounts of hrace were incubated with 273 m hip-his-leu at 37 c for 25 min reaction was stopped with 028 m naoh and then 20 mgml of o-phtaldialdehyde in methanol

easily introduced to a correctional facility via the staff or with face-to-face visits with family friends and legal counsel all who could be exposed in environments outside the prison as a result the bureau of prisons bop suspended all social visits for inmates until further notice bureau of prisons 2020b and state governments have taken similar approaches in order to attempt to maintain communication with loved ones and legal counsel the federal and each state government are providing concessions for example each bop inmate received 500 additional telephone minutes per month to allow for communication with individuals outside the correctional facility inmates in new york have been granted five free stamps per week and two free 30-min telephone calls per week new york department of corrections and community supervision 2020 other concessions have been provided to lessen the stress of incarceration such as providing the ability for family and friends to send post cards video messages and emails to the inmates the state of washington even approved a contract with swank motion pictures to provide facilities with movies for inmate viewing department of corrections washington state 2020 visits from legal counsel are essential for inmates to pursue civil liability and appeals cases during incarceration however the bureau of prisons suspended attorney visits for at least 30 days upon which re-evaluation will occur once stay-at-home orders are lifted nationwide with states following suit bureau of prisons 2020b the bop and state correctional facilities do allow confidential legal calls via telephone andor video platforms to ensure access to counsel if an in-person legal visit is deemed a necessity the attorney must undergo a health screening and temperature check before entry into a correctional facility bureau of prisons 2020b the bureau of prisons with state correctional administrative bodies following suit have made efforts to regulate inmate movement within correctional facilities bureau of prisons 2020b staggered meal times and recreation times have been implemented to limit congregate gatherings internal facility inmate movements have been suspended overall with some exceptions for instance transfers related to writs or interstate agreements on detainers are still permitted as well as transfers related to medical or mental health reasons if a bop inmate is transferred the following conditions must be metinmate must be in bop custody for at least 14 daysregional directors must notify bop emergency operations center prior to movement of the inmateexit screening performed for covid-19 symptoms if symptoms are exhibited cough shortness of breath andor temperature of 1004 degrees fahrenheit or greater the inmate will not be transferred and immediately placed in isolation the bop recognized that new inmates would be entering the system on a regular basis and would obviously require transfer approval however any newly-arrived bop inmates will be screened for covid-19 exposure risk factors and symptoms if an inmate is asymptomatic with a risk of exposure heshe will be quarantined inmates exhibiting symptoms will be isolated and tested for covid-19 bureau of prisons 2020b many states have made concessions for inmate medical visits with the hopes of encouraging inmates to seek medical attention if they are experiencing symptoms and decrease the spread of covid-19 through early detection prison policy initiative 2020 states like alabama minnesota and west virginia have suspended co-payments for incarcerated individuals as a result of the epidemic co-pays for inmates are usually between 25 but this is an extreme cost for inmates who often make less than 1 per hour prison policy initiative 2020 lower to no cost for a medical visit would hopefully decrease hesitation to seek medical attention and in turn increase likelihood of early detection and diagnosis of covid-19 as of late april 2020 the bop had obtained over 5000 test kits and multiple ventilators from local hospitals to assist with inmate treatment balsamo 2020 however treatment of infected inmate cases has come under fire by some of the families of those who are ill for example michael flemings 59 year-old father also named michael was serving 20 years at fci terminal island in los angeles for drug conspiracy and contracted covid-19 balsamo 2020 according to fleming the family was never notified that his fathers condition was worsening even when he was hooked to a ventilator they were unaware of his fathers condition until the prison chaplain contacted the family asking how they would like his remains to be handled california prison officials insisted they are following the guidelines set by the cdc and managing the prison population as efficiently as possible to stop the spread of the disease but special circumstances arise depending on the situation the covid-19 outbreak also had a tremendous effect on the professional and personal lives of correctional staff in federal and state facilities due to the high potential for transmission of the virus by a staff member to a facility in bledsoe county tennessee 583 of the 588 identified covid-19 cases were from the bledsoe correctional complex with a high potential for the initial infection entering the facility originating from a staff member according the facilitys medical director hutchinson 2020 staff in the state of washington have been issued n95 respirators to wear during work hours department of corrections washington state 2020 with the exception of relocation travel any planned travel by correctional staff nationwide has been suspended if staff live in areas with sustained community transmission as indicated by the center for disease control they were directed to participate in daily temperature checks and self-reporting of exposure for at least the next 30 days center for disease control 2020 the same requirement applied to outside contractors performing essential services or maintenance all other contract work was suspended furthermore volunteer visits have been suspended with the exception of consideration of inmates who request access to a religious advisor many states have considered early release for low level offenders on march 23 2020 the new york times reported the state of new jersey was planning to release approximately 1000 individuals from its jails to decrease the risk of spread of coronavirus disease covid-19 tully 2020 offenders with probation violations and low-level crimes sentenced in superior court were those considered for release also in late march 2020 the county jail in houston texas holding a population equivalent to three cruise ships stopped taking in individuals arrested for certain non-violent crimes aspinwall blakinger vansickle  thompson 2020 california governor gavin newsom announced the intent to release up to 3500 inmates to parole supervision to lessen the prison population while lowering the population levels in jails and prisons could decrease the likelihood of spread of covid-19 there are potential negative health repercussions to early release based on lack of housing for instance in los angeles county in california approximately 30 of the jail population was homeless before incarceration williams et al 2020 returning to the streets will equate to a vulnerability for exposure the same as incarceration los angeles recently reopened some of its recreation centers formerly closed due to the covid-19 to provide housing for homeless individuals the infiltration of covid-19 into our criminal justice system has also affected our community corrections programming with government buildings closed all over the nation physical check-ins with probation and parole officers are suspended indefinitely to practice social distancing states like massachusetts have decreased the use of electronic monitoring as a supervisory tactic to avoid physical contact between the person fitting the device and the probationer or parolee probation and parole officers are using video and telephone calls to communicate with clients rather than home or office visits schwartzapfel 2020 while a seemingly reasonable alternative there are potential barriers to prevent effective supervision for example the officer and supervised offender must both have reliable technology and internet connection to maintain communication lack of finances and other resources can limit the ability to ensure successful remote supervision as well as sporadic work schedules and personal circumstances susan rice chief probation officer in miami county indiana called this community corrections adaptation to covid-19 a social experiment as cited in schwartzapfel 2020 roles of the officers are evolving responsibilities of the offenders are changing and the success of these two melding together is yet to be determined the inability to meet in person with supervised individuals loses the personal connections officers have with their clients as well as the ability to monitor living environments and others in the household the potential to identify potential risky behaviors or unsafe living conditions could be diminished on the other hand it may provide evidence of a more cost-effective method of supervision rather than spending time and mileage to travel to see supervised individuals more check-ins per day can be accomplished via video chat or phone with less time and cost rices social experiment also involves the adaptation of probation and parole officers to their new job responsibilities as a result of covid-19 the roles of the supervising officers are now expanding in many situations requiring more time and effort to assist offenders with daily needs and living situations schwartzapfel 2020 probation and parole officers are also spending copious amounts of time helping clients file for unemployment and finding new resources as many social support resources eg alcoholics and narcotics anonymous counseling sessions and education courses are no longer physically meeting while some have moved to virtual meetings many do not have access to the technology to participate in the meetings or are unable to find meetings that work with their schedules community corrections agencies in the united states are also using covid-19 as an opportunity to revisit current sentencing policies brian lovins president-elect of the american probation and parole association stated this gives us a big opportunity to challenge the need for incarceration of nonviolent folks as cited in schwartzapfel 2020 probation and parole chiefs across the nation are calling for jurisdictions to strongly reconsider policies of jailing individuals for supervision violations the nyu marron institute of urban management found some probation and parole departments are only doing drug testing in high risk cases and ceased arresting individuals for low level technical violations schwartzapfel 2020 community corrections stakeholders like lovins are hoping for data that demonstrates successful community-based methods of supervision efforts are also being made on the federal and state level to identify inmates at high risk for contraction of the virus and consideration of alternate placement in the community on march 26 2020 attorney general william barr sent a memorandum to bop director michael carvajal requesting the bop utilize available statutory authorities to grant home confinement to eligible inmates who are at risk for covid-19 as of may 3 2020 an additional 1972 inmates had been placed on home confinement equating to an increase of 691 bureau of prisons 2020a the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act pl 116136 provided assistance to multiple facets of the criminal justice systems including the realm of community corrections extending the amount of time a bop inmate can be placed on home confinement when the attorney general finds that emergency conditions will materially affect the functioning of its facilities as cited in james  foster 2020 even juvenile probation departments are reconsidering use of sanctions during the pandemic dozens of federal and state agencies across the nation have joined together to demand a moratorium on fees and fines eg court costs restitution for juvenile probationers notable groups such as the american civil liberties union drug policy alliance the sentencing project and national association for the advancement of colored people signed a petition along with state legal aids and juvenile resource centers to cease assessment and collections of fines and fees and provide notification to families of this change in addition these groups are requesting free video and telephone calls for juveniles who are in custody so they may communicate with family and friends as well as providing free medical care and other resources berkeley law clinical program 2020 currently there are many unanswered questions about covid-19 including best practices regarding detection and prevention in our correctional facilities of the approximate 3300 covid-19 cases in four state correctional facilities arkansas north carolina ohio and virginia 96 of those cases were asymptomatic so  smith 2020 this lack of continuity in symptoms makes it difficult to identify all contracted cases while states like texas with larger inmate populations are reporting less cases than smaller states eg ohio it is important to keep in mind that the reported number of covid-19 contracted cases is most likely substantially higher than reported as individuals who are asymptomatic or exhibiting minimal symptoms may not get tested one of the most proactive and efficient measures that should be taken is increased testing of staff and inmates in correctional facilities any individual who is exhibiting any of the symptoms associated with covid-19 or has been exposed to someone with the virus should be tested states like michigan tennessee and california are beginning mass testing of inmates in some of their facilities to identify potential cases some facilities such as michigans lakeland correctional facility houses many of the states elderly inmates or those with underlying health conditions facilities such as these are moving to use proactive testing as much as possible to prevent spread and fatalities so  smith 2020 a trend that should be pushed as a nationwide policy throughout this pandemic and time of crisis government agencies have stepped up with massive financial opportunities to help support criminal justice agencies on april 1 2020 the bureau of justice statistics made 850 million available to public safety agencies struggling with response to covid-19 department of justice 2020 the coronavirus emergency supplemental funding program was open for 60 days for local state and tribal governments to apply for emergency assistance these funds could be used but were not limited to the following requests hiring personnel and paying overtime inmate medical needs and necessary resources and protective equipment1 later that month the office of justice programs 2020 announced almost 70 million in grant availability to support adult and juvenile reentry this funding will fund reentry programs focusing on agendas such as education substance abuse and community supervision as mentioned previously this is a fluid situation for the entire world every day new information is released and decisions are made by government and private agencies including our federal and state corrections system at the time this piece was written many states were still at stay at home orders andor phasing into some form of economic reopening it was yet to be determined if the rate of infection was stabilized and while the hope is a continued decrease of infection rate with social distancing practices the world awaits the fall season and potential spike much like other private and public entities any lessening of restrictions and increase of freedoms for individuals under correctional control can be changed at any due to maintain the safety of the community and those supervised  transparenz teilhabe und introjektive identifizierung karl-albrecht dreyer   eine haltung als psychoanalytiker und psychotherapeut die auf transparenz und teilhabe achtet verndert die perspektive auf den psychoanalytischen prozess dabei ist zu erfahren welch wertvolle begleiter transparenz und teilhabe sind unseren patienten und analysanden wird es leichter uns an ihren gedanken und gefhlen teilhaben zu lassen  eine fr den therapieerfolg unabdingbare voraussetzung es entsteht ein dialog der von der dyade gemeinsam hervorgebracht und getragen wird im therapeutischen prozess kann ber spezifische bertragungsmomente und deren einfluss auf die beziehung kommuniziert werden in dieser arbeit mchte ich zeigen welcher gewinn aus einer transparenten haltung in reflektierter offenheit und wechselseitiger teilhabe entsteht und welche weiterfhrenden mglichkeiten sich daraus ergeben das fhre ich am beispiel der introjektiven identifizierung aus wenn ich in der mnnlichen form schreibe meine ich beide geschlechter transparenz entsteht wenn der patient die grundregel der freien assoziation als aufforderung zu offenheit ernst nimmt und der therapeut in reflektierter offenheit nach auen und nach innen in gleichschwebender aufmerksamkeit und gebotener abstinenz die unbewussten prozesse zu verstehen und zu interpretieren sucht diesen letzten teil fasse ich nochmal krzer transparenz entsteht aus der reflektierten offenheit des therapeuten nach meinem verstndnis verlangt dies bisweilen auch dass der therapeut sein empfinden mitteilt sein schweigen kann auch wenn es abstinent intendiert ist in manchen momenten manipulativ wirken luiz 2006 gibt ein eindrucksvolles beispiel einer notwendig transparenten behandlung wieder transparente momente entstehen in behandlungen besonders dann wenn berraschende begegnungen die beispielsweise in now moments stern 2010 entstehen analysiert werden teilhabe wird wechselseitig verstanden der analysand lsst seinen analytiker an seinen assoziationen teilhaben der analytiker wiederum lsst seinen analysanden an seinen berlegungen und empfindungen insoweit teilhaben wie diese fr den analytischen prozess fruchtbar sinnvoll und zur klrung notwendig sind teilhabe ist also ein prozess in zwei richtungen vom patienten in richtung auf den therapeuten und vom therapeuten in richtung auf seinen patienten beide nehmen aktiv teil und lassen passiv an sich teilhaben diesen vorgang beschreiben stolorow und atwood 1992 aus relationaler sicht ferro 2005 unter dem gesichtspunkt des feldes das bohleber 2014 s 66 in ein kontinuierliches gemeinsames trumen das wachtraumdenken bei bion 1962 auflst und das von ogden 2006 s 61 revolutionr neu in einer passageren auflsung der subjektgrenzen konzipiert wird das groe feld der intersubjektiven und relationalen psychoanalyse prsentiert sich vielgestaltig altmeyer und thom 2006 nennen ihr buch die vernetzte seele im untertitel die intersubjektive wende in der psychoanalyse die beiden autoren gehen davon aus dass es die ergebnisse der suglingsforscher sind die der intersubjektivitt letztlich zum durchbruch verholfen haben aus einer anderen perspektive sieht bohleber 2014 in der kritischen gesellschaftstheorie der 1960er-jahre einen ausgangspunkt dafr dass sich die intersubjektive sicht durchgesetzt hat die philosophischen anstze von buber und binswanger hatten groen einfluss auf die tiefenpsychologie in deutschland die zum teil noch geprgt war vom alten gring-institut wenn auch die damaligen anstze bereits die fundamentale bedeutung der intersubjektivitt betonten gelang die bersetzung in reale klinische beziehungskonstellationen nicht zu einer neuaufnahme der themen um intersubjektivitt kam es ausgehend von der kritischen gesellschaftstheorie ab den 1960er-jahren lorenzer hebt 1970 s 141 hervor dass sich das hier beschriebene verstehen der interaktion der subjekte mit ihrer mitwelt und umwelt zuwendet ebenso lsst sich eine psychoanalytisch-intersubjektive sicht auf dem theoretischen fundament von klein und bion grnden bhme 2014 und mertens 2013 wiederum legt in seinem aufsatz das zwei-personen-unbewusste  unbewusste wahrnehmungsprozesse in der analytischen situation den schwerpunkt auf die unbewusste wechselseitige einstimmung aber auch die perspektive des psychoanalytischen feldes mit sich in dieses feld hinein auflsender individualitt wie von baranger und baranger 2008 sowie von ferro 2005 und ogden 2006 beschrieben kann als theoretische untermauerung einer intersubjektiven betrachtungsweise gewhlt werden intersubjektives psychoanalytisches denken und arbeiten wurden in der vergangenheit durch vielgestaltige auch auerhalb der psychoanalyse gelegene einflsse befrdert auch in der gegenwart beeinflussen die gesellschaftlichen entwicklungen unsere psychoanalytische theorie der vernderte umgang mit daten und das wachsende bewusstsein zur infomationellen selbstbestimmung wirken auf unsere theorie und praxis ebenso wie der gewaltige druck der beispielsweise aufgrund einer epidemie wie covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 auf der bevlkerung lastet daraus entstehende konflikte lassen sich in einem demokratischen gemeinwesen nur durch transparenz und teilhabe mildern die begriffe transparenz und teilhabe die ich fr die psychoanalytische theorie und behandlungstechnik vorschlage tragen dazu bei aktuell bedrohlichen entwicklungen einen mit hoffnung angereicherten sprachlichen ausdruck gegenberzustellen eine besondere rolle spielt in diesem zusammenhang der abwehr- oder interaktionsmechanismus der introjektiven identifizierung transparenz und teilhabe helfen dabei die unbewussten anteile der introjektiven identifizierung zu entschlsseln den zusammenhang und das zusammenspiel dieser mechanismen werde ich in der vorliegenden arbeit theoretisch untersuchen und an einem klinischen beispiel veranschaulichen ebenso vielgestaltig wie theorie und praxis der intersubjektivitt ist heutzutage die handhabung der abstinenz dies ist nur folgerichtig wenn wir uns die geschichte der begriffe abstinenz und indifferenz s freud 1919a vergegenwrtigen die aus der zeit der triebtheorie s freud 1915b und des zweiten topischen modells ab 1920 s freud 1923b stammen die erste zeit der psychoanalyse war geprgt von modellen in denen personen eher voneinander abgegrenzt aufgefasst wurden s freud 1912e heute hingegen weisen die modelle der intersubjektiven affektivitt auf wege hin wie durch affekte personengrenzen berschritten werden und interaktionen in die psyche des anderen hineinwirken knnen im jahre 1984 pldiert cremerius fr eine operationale anwendung der abstinenzregel als funktion des analytischen prozesses 1984 ogden geht zwanzig jahre spter erheblich weiter 2006 s 61 und spricht im rahmen der projektiven identifizierung von einer passageren auflsung der subjektgrenzen von analytiker und analysand insoweit sich die wahrnehmung der subjektgrenzen auflst ist eine abstinenz die diese grenze eigentlich voraussetzt nicht mehr eindeutig zu definieren zusammenfassend ergibt sich daraus nach ermann 2014 s 121 eine neukonzeption des klassischen abstinenzprinzips  aus intersubjektiver sicht ist diese regel die oft sehr starr gehandhabt wurde durch ein funktionales prinzip ersetzt worden danach hat der analytiker je nach lage der dinge zu entscheiden ob wie weit und in welcher form er auf wnsche und begehren des patienten eingeht um anschlieend zu untersuchen wie der patient sein verhalten verarbeitet zu diesem reflexionsprozess trgt eine haltung von transparenz und teilhabe wesentliches bei weil durch sie die motive der interaktion klarer beschrieben und bearbeitet werden knnen nach meiner einschtzung finden im psychoanalytischen theoriegebude transparenz und teilhabe nicht die beachtung die ihnen aufgrund ihres potenzials unbewusstes bewusst werden zu lassen zukommt ich verfolge in meiner arbeit die these dass dies insbesondere fr die bearbeitung der introjektiven identifizierung gilt sie kann gnstigenfalls dann gelingen wenn der analytiker in einer haltung arbeitet durch die transparent wird was gerade vor sich geht seit ferenczi 1933 sind uns die grundlagen fr das verstndnis der introjektiven identifizierung bekannt die er in seiner berhmten arbeit sprachverwirrung zwischen den erwachsenen und dem kind gelegt hat es war dann klein 1946 die den vorgang der introjektiven identifizierung auf den begriff gebracht hat die introjektive identifizierung wie wir sie heute verstehen ist ein abwehr- und interaktionsmechanismus der an der grenze zwischen pathogenese und salutogenese steht durch die initiale introjektion verschwinden quasi konflikthaft-bedrohliche affekte im unbewussten der introjizierenden person  insofern trgt der vorgang einen pathogenetischen charakter die folgen im neurotischen geschehen knnen bis zur entwicklung eines falschen selbst fhren auf der anderen seite kann in der depressiven position eine identifizierung des subjektes mit den introjizierten affekten die tr zu einer neuen entwicklung ffnen mit dem aufscheinen eines neuen verstndnisses beginnt eine salutogenetische wirkung der introjektiven identifizierung diese prozesse knnen sowohl im individuellen leben wie in der psychoanalyse geschehen neue erfahrungen entstehen aus einer bewussten aneignung der zunchst unbewussten introjektion in der regel nimmt im psychoanalytischen prozess der analytiker zuerst etwas wahr das sich in seinem inneren fremd nicht zu ihm gehrend anfhlt das gefhl der fremdheit kann lngere zeit verborgen bleiben erste wahrnehmungen tauchen auf und kndigen die mgliche bewusstwerdung an erst vorsichtig dann ermutigt durch ein erstes verstehen kommt der weg zu einem bewussten verstndnis in gang in dem mae wie dieser vorgang gelingt ffnet sich ein verstndnis fr umfangreiche bisher nicht bewusstseinsfhige zusammenhnge um zusammenzufassen durch den mechanismus der introjektiven identifizierung kann von unbewusst zu unbewusst eine brcke zwischen analytiker und analysand geschlagen werden den zentralen unterschied der introjektiven im vergleich zur projektiven identifizierung fasst schoenhals hart 2007 s 171 wie folgt die introjektiven identifizierungen mit den guten objekten frdern die integrative entwicklung in richtung depressiver position whrend die projektiven identifizierungen den ausstieg aus dieser entwicklung bedeuten beispiele fr introjektive identifizierungen finden wir in unseren behandlungen hufig dann wenn es in der entwicklung des kindes eine notwendigkeit oder einen zwang gab empathiegeleitet mithilfe einer introjektiven identifizierung zu versuchen unverstndliches verletzendes elterliches verhalten durch bernahme und verinnerlichung zu entschrfen das kind nimmt unverstndliches in sich auf bildet daraus ein introjekt und identifiziert sich damit die uere gefahr wird so durch verinnerlichung entschrft das kind verzichtet damit aber zugleich auf eigene entwicklung und versucht stattdessen die eltern die es so dringend braucht doch noch gut genug zu machen ferenczi hat es in seinem aufsatz 1933 beschrieben den inneren abbildern jener vorgnge und dem hufig damit verbundenen entwicklungsverzicht begegnen wir sehr viel spter in unserem behandlungszimmer eine haltung empathischer transparenz des analytikers bietet dann die chance verborgene signale aufzunehmen introjektive identifizierungen bewusst zu machen und dadurch einen ausweg zu ffnen  diesen weg illustriere ich nun in meiner fallvignette eine vorbemerkung zum verstndnis von vignetten mit schlein 2002 gehe ich von der psychoanalyse als einer wissenschaft aus die mit konnotativen theorien arbeitet daher bleiben ihre aussagen zwangslufig offen und unscharf an narrative gebunden falldarstellungen knnen folgerichtig keine beweise liefern sie beziehen ihre qualitt aus ihrer plausibilitt und begrnden ein denken in fllen wie dies hampe und strassberg beschreiben 2015 s 281 dreyer 2017 s 3439 die methode der psychoanalytischen erkenntnis ist eine disziplin die mythen und geschichten aus der literatur zu entwicklungsschemata formalisiert und sie zusammen mit wirklich erhobenen fallgeschichten aus der psychoanalytischen praxis zum erkenntnishintergrund individueller geschichten macht als ich heute vor ihrer haustre stand wollte ich mit meinem schlssel aufschlieen beginnt die patientin heiter die stunde ihre fehlleistung ist fr mich ein zeichen dass sie bei mir eine heimat gefunden hat in der stunde spricht sie ber ihre aktuelle beziehung und die bedeutung von sexualitt sie fragt sich ob ihr partner fr sie der richtige sei ich stelle nach einiger zeit berrascht fest dass in mir traurigkeit entsteht sie passt nicht zu der stimmung und dem tonfall der patientin ich kann mir mein empfinden selbst nicht erklren ich bin weder bedrckt noch traurig in die stunde gekommen im zuhren bleibe ich mit dieser diskrepanz beschftigt und frage mich ob ich diese im sinne der negative capability bion 1970 s 125 aushalten oder durch aussprechen die diskrepanz der reflexion zugnglich machen soll wenn ich eine mglichkeit whle verliere ich damit zugleich die andere und beeinflusse in jedem fall den weiteren verlauf  auch durch schweigen den gedanken ich knnte komplementr zu ihr die empfindungen ihres verlassenen freundes fhlen spreche ich aus dieses verstehensangebot gewinnt jedoch keine bedeutung sehr viel spter in der reflexion der hiesigen verffentlichung erkenne ich in meinem frustranen deutungsversuch eine parallele zum vergeblichen versuch meiner patientin mit ihrem schlssel mein haus aufzuschlieen ich habe bemerkt dass ich whrend ihrer schilderung traurig wurde ohne dass ich sagen knnte weswegen formuliere ich dann offen der weitere verlauf der stunde nimmt eine berraschende wendung wir fragen uns in der stunde ob ihr beziehungsproblem mit ihrer missbrauchserfahrung als teenager zu tun haben knnte sie gebraucht im gesprchsverlauf den ausdruck dumm um ihre aktuelle reaktion in der stunde und ihr selbstempfinden generell zu beschreiben ich frage nach woraufhin sie bekrftigt ich bin dumm ich bitte um weitere erluterung sie findet schlielich zu einem literarischen vergleich mithilfe des romans 1984 von orwell 2002 darin wrden sich die protagonisten selbst dumm machen sagt sie so gehe es ihr auch sie sei ebenso dumm wie die brger im roman von orwell und betont damit den aktiven part des sich-selbst-verdummens der aktiven ich-einschrnkung von der ferenczi 1933 schrieb ganz im gegensatz zum inhalt ihrer berlegung finde ich ihre erklrung ausgesprochen klug nun tauchen in mir mgliche zusammenhnge zwischen ihrem gefhl dumm zu sein und meinem gefhl von traurigkeit auf ich frage mich ob mein mir rtselhaft gebliebenes gefhl mglicherweise ihre abgewehrten nicht ins bewusstsein zugelassenen affekte enthlt traurigkeit entsteht stellvertretend in mir whrend die patientin nach ihrer aussage kein anderes mittel fand als sich selbst zu verdummen um qulende zusammenhnge unbewusst zu halten als ich diesen zusammenhang ausspreche beginnt fr die patientin der weg ihre selbstverdummung und ihre scham darber zu verstehen und die lang verborgenen emotionen wieder zu erleben ich denke dass ich zunchst im rahmen einer introjektiven identifizierung die trauer aus dem unbewussten der patientin bernahm nur ber mich konnte sie auch ihr bewusst werden zum verstndnis der vignette sie beginnt mit einer fehlleistung die wir manchmal in fortgeschrittenen behandlungen beobachten knnen wenn patienten versuchen mit ihrem schlssel die praxis ihres analytikers aufzuschlieen ebenso wie die praxis fr meine patientin bleibt mir meine empfindung zu beginn der stunde verschlossen und mein erster deutungsversuch war ebenfalls vergeblich gleichzeitig wird durch die fehlleistung der wunsch ausgedrckt zugang zum verborgenen zu finden in der stunde entfaltet sich ein unbewusster plan der patientin die offenkundige fehlleistung und mein erstes nicht-verstehen erklren nicht auf welchem wege mich die empfindungen erreicht haben die ich als fremd wahrnahm ich gehe im verstehensprozess der stunde davon aus dass es auf vollkommen unbewusstem weg geschah die fremdheit ist ein klinisches zeichen dem ich immer wieder begegne dreyer 2017 es handelt sich um eine besondere qualitt des fremden unerklrlichen und ich-dystonen zunchst gilt es meine eigenen affekte in ihrer bedeutung fr die behandlung zu erschlieen dieser weg fhrt  so meine erfahrung  zum erfolg wenn ich mich dazu entschliee transparent zu benennen dass es da etwas gibt das ich spre das ich mir allein aber nicht erklren kann dieses vorgehen grndet in der annahme dass es sich um eine introjektive identifizierung handelt durch die ich am unbewussten meines patienten oder analysanden unmittelbar teilhabe und die ber meine gegenbertragung aufzufinden ist der austausch darber schafft bewusstsein wenn er in einer atmosphre der transparenz und teilhabe stattfindet es ist weiter meine these dass es sich um ablufe handelt die regelhaft und in verschiedenen analysen hnlich wiederkehren um dies nher auszufhren werde ich nun unter dem aspekt von transparenz und teilhabe die theorie zur gegenbertragung und zur introjektiven identifizierung nher betrachten um danach  erneut an meinem fall  meine thesen abschlieend zu diskutieren bahnbrechend fr unser heutiges verstndnis der gegenbertragung waren die verffentlichungen von heimann 19502016a s 111117 zur gegenbertragung und heinrich racker 19502002 bertragung und gegenbertragung  studien zur psychoanalytischen technik beide arbeiten erscheinen im gleichen jahr und betonen unabhngig voneinander dass die gegenbertragung nicht lnger als hindernis zu betrachten ist sondern vielmehr ein frderndes element fr die analyse darstellt das was zunchst als technischer fehler erschien wurde zum katalysator des therapeutischen prozesses racker 19502002 s 150151 sah bereits die mglichkeit der wechselseitigen bezogenheit von bertragung und gegenbertragung von analytiker und analysand es kann also auch die gegenbertragung des analytikers sein die erst die bertragung des analysanden anschiebt die dann anschlieend vom analytiker gedeutet wird das henne-ei-problem lst sich auf wenn man nicht mehr in vorher-nachher-kategorien denkt sondern von einer wechselwirkung ausgeht der satz die gegenbertragung des analytikers geht der bertragung des patienten voraus drckt dann nur die eine hlfte des geschehens aus er knnte ergnzt werden durch den satz die bertragung des analytikers geht der gegenbertragung des analysanden voraus heimann 2016b vertieft ihre auffassung 30 jahre nach der erstverffentlichung 1978 mit einem titel der bereits die kernaussage der arbeit formuliert ber die notwendigkeit fr den analytiker mit seinem patienten natrlich zu sein sie berichtet eine berraschende intuitivdeutung die wre sie nicht so treffend krnkend gewirkt htte zur berraschung beider ffnet die analytikerin durch diese deutung eine lange von ihrer patientin verschwiegene geschichte die die analyse entscheidend voranbringt die autorin weist darauf hin dass ihr vorgehen weiterer ausarbeitung bedrfe racker und heimann machten mit ihren verffentlichungen deutlich welch berraschende erkenntnisse die analyse der gegenbertragung zugnglich macht andere autoren entwickeln die intersubjektive auffassung von gegenbertragung weiter jacobs 1986 gabbard 1995 und ogden 2006 bezogen auf das feldkonzept schlielich baranger und baranger 2008 sowie ferro 2005 auf eindrucksvolle weise deutet besonders ogden 2006 s 61 diese ereignisse in analysen er zeigt wie enactments oftmals fr das verstndnis des unbewussten prozesses entscheidend sind und die aufgabe darin besteht sich ihnen trumerisch berlassen zu knnen bis sich ein neues verstndnis eingestellt hat ogden beschreibt damit eine radikale verwandlung was dabei im psychoanalytischen prozess geschieht ist ein partieller zerfall der unbewussten dialektik von subjektivitt und intersubjektivitt dieser zerfall fhrt schlielich zur erzeugung einer besonderen form des analytischen dritten der sich analytiker und analysand als getrennte subjekte in hohem mae unterwerfen dem dritten der unterwerfung eine erfolgreiche psychoanalyse bedeutet dass die daran beteiligten dieses unbewusste dritte das nur eine spielart von intersubjektivitt ist aufheben und sich den im psychoanalytischen prozess freilich verwandelten subjektstatus wieder aneignen indem sie zu eigenstndigen und gleichwohl voneinander abhngigen individuen werden das erreichen sie dadurch dass sie einander gegenseitig anerkennen wie gelangen die von racker theoretisch ausgearbeiteten und von ogden klinisch dargestellten phnomene in die interaktion der partner der dyade und wie knnen sie bewusst gemacht werden eine antwort ergibt sich aus der beschreibung der brckenfunktion der introjektiven identifizierung ogden beschreibt klinisch den sich im unbewussten abspielenden brckenschlag zwischen den beiden an der analytischen situation beteiligten unterscheidet jedoch nicht zwischen projektiver und introjektiver identifizierung er spricht nur von projektiver identifizierung ich halte es fr zulssig seine beschreibung einer partiellen und passageren auflsung der subjektgrenzen fr die introjektive identifizierung zu bernehmen gerade in der introjektiven identifizierung sind die bernahme und vermischung von affekten beider beteiligter subjekte zu beobachten bollas 1997 s 168 ff fgt den beiden mechanismen noch die extraktive introjektion hinzu zunchst ist eine abgrenzung der introjektiven von der projektiven identifizierung erforderlich in der literatur werden beide vorgnge in der groen bersichtsarbeit von grotstein 1994 beschrieben sodr 2012 und spillius 2012 unterscheiden zwischen projektiver und introjektiver identifizierung sie betonen die positiv-libidinsen seiten der introjektiven identifizierung und warnen zugleich vor ihrer idealisierung oshaugnessy 2007 s 105 weist darauf hin dass die introjektive identifizierung im vergleich zur projektiven identifizierung insgesamt wenig beachtet wurde dies ergnzt scharff 1992 sowohl fr die projektive als auch fr die introjektive identifizierung aus intersubjektiver sicht eekhoff 2016 benennt schlielich die auergewhnliche qualitt des wechselseitigen austauschs von unbewusst zu unbewusst und nennt die wirkung der introjektiven identifizierung in ihrem titel evokativ eine differenzierung zwischen den unbewussten vorgngen der projektiven und der introjektiven identifizierung bei der projektiven identifizierung wird der projizierte inhalt vom projizierenden als nicht mehr zu seiner person gehrend wahrgenommen der projizierte inhalt wird stattdessen demjenigen zugerechnet der damit projektiv identifiziert wurde der projizierende ist dadurch vom inhalt seiner projektion befreit bei der introjektiven identifizierung dagegen bleibt der innere dialog des introjizierenden mit den introjizierten inhalten bestehen introjiziert wird etwas fremdes das in teilen als fremd erkennbar bleiben kann in anderen teilen dem erfahrungshorizont des introjizierenden nahe vertraut ist letzteres bildet den anker fr die bewusstwerdung die extraktive introjektion bollas 1997 s 173 ist ein mechanismus bei dem ein mensch in das innenleben eines anderen eindringt und bestimmte elemente davon vereinnahmt das opfer einer extraktiven introjektion fhlt sich der betreffenden anteile seines selbst beraubt ist das opfer ein kind so hat es keine klare vorstellung davon weshalb es auf bestimmte elemente seines psychischen lebens kein recht zu haben scheint sie spielt sich also im inneren des introjizierenden ab und steht der projektiven identifizierung in ihrem aggressiv-aufgeladenen modus nahe wie wird aus einer introjektiven identifizierung ein fruchtbarer beitrag zur behandlung die brckenbildung der introjektiven identifizierung beruht auf der zweiseitigen eigenschaft des introjizierten inhalts einerseits bleibt er sprbar behaftet mit etwas fremdem bislang unbekanntem und andererseits ist er stabil eingebettet in die psyche dessen der introjiziert mit etwas bung kann dieser doppelcharakter vom analytiker im dialog herausgesprt werden es findet zuerst eine innere prfung und aufarbeitung in der phase der gegenbertragungsanalyse im analytiker statt was wurde mir zur introjektion angeboten und was wurde von mir introjiziert soweit spielt sich der vorgang im inneren des analytikers ab im nchsten schritt wird mithilfe der noch vagen hypothese ein brckenschlag versucht eingeleitet durch worte die vorsichtig das ungewhnlich-unsichere des vorgehens zum ausdruck bringen um dem analytiker einen rckzug von seiner idee zu ermglichen sollte ein irrtum vorliegen sollte der patient durch neu ins bewusstsein tretende einflle dem dialog eine entscheidende wendung geben drfen wir davon ausgehen dass es gelungen ist unbewusstes und abgespaltenes material aufzuspren wir prfen und przisieren dann unsere hypothese wenn dies alles gelingt ist die analyse einen wesentlichen schritt vorankommen hier noch einmal die mglichen wirkungen und chancen der konzeptualisierung der introjektiven identifizierung als einem brckenkonzeptdem analytiker wird es mglich empfindungen aus seinem eigenen unbewussten mit anteilen aus dem unbewussten seines analysanden zu verbinden sich diese bewusst zu machen und als analytisches material zu nutzen eine bereicherung des analytischen prozessesim analysanden bleiben die prozesse der introjektiven identifizierung zunchst unbewusst sie stammen aus seiner kindheit und bedrfen der analytischen aufarbeitung da sie mit umfangreichen pathologischen abwehrvorgngen verbunden sind mithilfe der inneren arbeit des analytikers gelingt es einen bewussten zugang zu finden und die grnde fr die abspaltung ins unbewusste aufzuheben im konzept der introjektiven identifizierung ist eine entwicklungsmglichkeit von der pathogenese zur salutogenese angelegt die ihre wurzeln in der frhen mutter-kind-interaktion hat hierzu bion 2009 fonagy und target 2006 diskutiert bei dreyer 2017 s 117 ff s 174 ergnzen mchte ich an dieser stelle noch dass es durchaus nicht selten vorkommt dass die schritte der bewusstwerdung vor allem auf der seite des patienten ablaufen die 30-jhige patientin stammt aus einer kleinen stadt im alentejo portugal da ich kein portugiesisch kann weichen wir bisweilen ins neutrale franzsisch aus ihres ist besser als meines manchmal verstndigen wir uns auf englisch in der zeit der behandlung wird ihr deutsch immer besser sie wurde als teenager von ihrem klavierlehrer missbraucht inzwischen ist er angezeigt und verurteilt die aussage meiner patientin spielt dabei eine wesentliche rolle ihr vater wurde von seinem vater krperlich misshandelt kann bis heute nicht darber sprechen und ist krperlich und seelisch krank ich finde zu der folgenden psychodynamischen hypothese die patientin einzelkind hat in einer fatalen mischung aus einfhlung und identifikation mit dem vater aktiv dessen kindheitssituation reproduziert sein kreuz grotstein 1994 auf sich genommen um sich auf diesem weg doch noch in den ansonsten unnahbaren vater einfhlen zu lernen auf diesem boden kann sich spter der missbrauch durch den klavierlehrer entwickeln als die patientin den klavierunterricht bei diesem lehrer bereits beendet hatte erzhlt ihr die schwester des vaters die jahrelang quer durch europa auf der flucht vor ihrer familie war von der schlimmen kindheit des vaters und besttigt damit was sich die patientin emotional bereits erschlossen hatte ein gesprch mit ihm darber ist bis heute nicht mglich auch im leben der patientin folgen wilde jahre des inneren und ueren kampfes mit gothic-phase selbstschdigung und beziehungslosigkeit dessen ungeachtet vervollstndigt sie ihr klavierstudium in mailand paris und london zuletzt an einer musikhochschule in deutschland sie ist heute selbst klavierlehrerin und leidet unter den folgen ihrer erfahrungen in ihrem unterricht zu ihrer missbrauchserfahrung sie berichtet ber unterrichtsbegegnungen im haus des klavierlehrers fernab anderer huser wo er ihr seine hnde auf die schultern gelegt und sie aufgefordert hat ihr tshirt auszuziehen er sagte man muss als musiker nackt spielen knnen ein andermal setzt er sich mit geffneten beinen vor sie hin weist auf sein glied und fragt ob sie wisse warum er das tue im prozess wird offenbar dass es viele derart von ihm missbrauchte klavierschlerinnen gibt sie war die lteste und erste die anzeige erstattet hat ihre eltern ahnten nichts und sie verbarg es vor ihnen in den zwei jahren der zweistndigen behandlung im sitzen gibt es viele bewegende momente in denen beispielsweise meine art die treppe herunterzukommen sie an ihren professeur erinnert dazu unsere mikrointeraktion im ersten behandlungsjahr bemerkt sie einmal sie knne nicht denken mir geht es in der stunde hnlich schlielich kommt mir der einfall es ist die zerstrung durch den missbrauch der missbrauch zerstrt das denken wenn ich als professeur die treppe herunterkomme haben wir jetzt hier was sonst drauen bleibt die erinnerung an den missbrauch ab diesem moment verbindet sich mit meinem treppab die alte missbrauchssituation die nun folgende ausfhrliche sequenz liegt zwei wochen vor dem material meiner eingangsvignette die patientin kommt zurckhaltender als sonst in eine stunde was ist wenn wir schweigen fragt sie mich ich vermute was sie besttigt dass sie darber nachdenkt ob sie mich dann langweilen wrde das wre eine groe gefahr denn in ihrer fantasie wird aus langeweile missbrauch wir gelangen durch diese unscheinbare eingangsfrage unmittelbar in die vergangene welt ihres missbrauchs bald darauf fasst sie sich versehentlich mit dem finger in ihr rechtes auge und sagt entschuldigung mich berhrt schmerzlich dass sie sich selbst schmerzen zufgt und sich auch noch dafr entschuldigt  unklar bleibt bei wem wir sprechen weiter darber was es mit dem schweigen auf sich haben knnte und dass dies fr sie mit der angst einhergeht es knnte so etwas schreckliches wie ein missbrauch passieren mir dmmert was ich noch nicht glaube aussprechen zu knnen meine assoziation ein auge auf jemanden werfen fhrt mich schlielich zu der deutung ob sie sich wohl deshalb entschuldigt habe weil sie  so seltsam es auch klingen mag  tatschlich schuld empfinde schuld dafr dass sie langeweile habe entstehen lassen wodurch sie den professeur provoziert haben knnte oder genauer sie knnte im rckblick denken dass sie ihn provoziert und dadurch das ganze missbrauchsunglck selbst ins rollen gebracht habe die patientin denkt kurz darber nach ich bin sehr in sorge ob ich ihr zu viel zugemutet habe dann lacht sie befreit und sagt das stimmt sie schttelt den kopf darber was ich herausgefunden habe sie ist durch meine deutung nicht gekrnkt sondern befreit ein besonderer moment in der behandlung in eine der folgestunden kommt sie in guter stimmung setzt sich und lacht es sei schn gewesen im konzert das sie im ausland gespielt hat ber nacht sei sie mit drei kollegen zwei violinen und einem cello hingefahren kleine stadt kirche mitten im see auf einer insel die aus dem see herausragt es hat gut geklappt morgen will ihr chef mit ihr sprechen alle waren sehr angetan bei ihr lief es sehr gut auch die anderen finden das berhaupt ist sie frei im rcken keine verspannungen mehr ihre kollegen sind oft schlechter laune sie nicht nach einiger zeit in der ich darber nachdenke welche bedeutung wohl dieses bild des sees mit insel und kirche hat fragt mich die patientin woran ich denke ich spreche in meiner antwort ber meine im stillen entwickelte hypothese ob es wohl richtig sei von einer art umkehrung ins gegenteil zu sprechen da ist die insel im see umgeben von wasser eine isolierte idylle mit konzert und besuchern und als bild des gegensatzes dazu das haus des professeur einsam und isoliert isoliert im schrecken zu meiner berraschung antwortet die patientin ja genau das ist es ich bin perplex denke das ist ihr schnelles tempo und wei selbst nicht was ihre antwort bedeutet ich hatte unfertige gedanken ausgesprochen und finde zunchst keine verbindung zu ihrer reaktion ich wei jetzt nicht wie sie das meinen sage ich deshalb daraufhin erlutert sie mir wie sie in den letzten tagen immer wieder ber einen satz von mir nachdenken muss der sie jedes mal aufs neue befreie es war meine antwort auf die frage des professeur die sie so sehr qulte er fragte sie ob sie sex hatte he mit 13 stellt sie ihre hochgradige irritation von damals dar hinter der ich die extraktive introjektion des klavierlehrers vermute befreit habe sie dass ich vor ein paar stunden kommentiert hatte das war sein gedanke seither wird sie nicht mehr von fragen geqult weil sie erkennen kann dass es gar nicht ihr thema sondern seines war offenbar wurden die folgen der extraktiven introjektion durch den professor der ihr das gefhl ihrer unschuldigen krperlichkeit genommen hatte durch meinen hinweis dass es seine gedanken waren wirksam aufgelst immer wieder sei sie seit unserer stunde auf diese erkenntnis zurckgekehrt und jedes mal sei danach die geschichte anders befreit verlaufen das habe ihr gute laune gemacht dass sie sich nicht mehr durch die frage was hat ihn zu der vermutung gebracht belastet fhle ich glaube verstanden zu haben und sage ich habe ssie ihnen geschenkt gleich ist mir meine bemerkung in ihrer doppeldeutigkeit peinlich einerseits kann sie auf die gute laune bezogen werden andererseits kann sie auf die patientin als person bezogen werden und das eine oder das andere htte ich ihr geschenkt die patientin befreit mich aus meiner peinlichen lage und verbessert mich nein zurckgegeben ich antworte erleichtert ja sie haben recht zurckgeben ist das richtige wort ich kann noch anfgen hier hat sich zwischen uns eben wiederholt worber wir sprachen  in einer kleineren dimension natrlich dann ist die stunde zu ende zwei wochen spter ereignet sich die stunde von der ich eingangs berichtet habe meine patientin versucht die praxistre mit ihrem schlssel aufzuschlieen und mich beschleicht das gefhl der traurigkeit in psychoanalytischen behandlungen sind viele wege mglich auf denen unbewusstes verstanden werden kann nur einer davon wird verwirklicht im prozessgeschehen stellt sich die frage wie lange  im hinblick auf das ziel der bewusstwerdung  soll man in indifferenz und offenheit abwarten und sich dem wachtraumdenken bion 1962 berlassen wann und wie lassen sich introjektive prozesse optimal verstehen es kann im zuhren zu frh gedeutet oder zu lange gewartet und in beiden fllen die besonderheit des augenblicks verpasst werden die bedeutung des augenblicks fr eine deutung fasst strachey 1934 s 150 in den begriff des point of urgency fr die darstellung in einer fallvignette und ganz generell gilt darber hinaus die plausibilitt einer fallgeschichte bleibt gebunden an idiosynkratische kreisprozesse deren ablauf sich im kreislauf zwischen annahme einer psychodynamik deutung der interaktion beobachtung der reaktion vermutung ber erreichte effekte und korrektur der annahme abspielt jede prognostische aussage bleibt ebenso einem kreisprozess verhaftet und immer offen fr alternative konzeptualisierungen und alternative kreisprozesse zur wissenschaftstheoretischen einordnung dieses vorgehens greife ich auf die erluterungen zum denken in fllen von hampe und strassberg 2015 s 281 vgl obigen abschnitt eine fallvignette zurck durch generalisierung wie sie uns auch aus mythen und

berichte geht es um zuhren in einer haltung von reverie und wachtraumdenken wie es ferro 2006 als bedeutende entdeckung bions hervorgehoben hat im dargestellten abschnitt fasst sich meine patientin in ihr eigenes auge und entschuldigt sich sofort dafr die kleine selbstverletzung mit entschuldigung kann als symbolische darstellung ihres aktiv-fantasierten handlungsanteils am missbrauch verstanden werden meine deutung dieses zusammenhangs fhrt in der stunde zum bericht ber eine befreit-schne reise in die welt der musik die heitere helle idylle nimmt eine stimmung vorweg in der die patientin dann zwei wochen spter in die stunde kommt die ich ausfhrlich darstelle zu beginn dieser letzten stunde eines dreiwchigen behandlungsabschnitts bleibt mir meine traurigkeit lange fremd die in aufflligem gegensatz zur heiteren stimmung meiner patientin steht ich stelle mir in der analyse meiner gegenbertragung fragen bin ich traurig darber dass sie sich trennt und nehme ich die gefhle des verlassenen freundes vorweg knnte die ankndigung der patientin dass sie sich von ihrem freund trennt ein menetekel dafr sein dass sie sich bald auch von mir trennt zahlreiche interpretationen sind an dieser stelle vorstellbar der weitere verlauf der stunde fhrt in eine berraschend andere richtung die von den kleinen zeichen des misslingens zu beginn der stunde ausgeht die praxistre ffnet sich mit dem schlssel der patientin nicht und meine erste deutung ffnet keinen weg zu ihrem unbewussten ich spre deutlich die mir unerklrliche traurigkeit und erlebe bewusst eine diskontinuitt zur heiterkeit meiner patientin ich habe gelernt auf solche diskontinuierlichen momente dreyer 2017 s 93 ff besonders zu achten weil sie vorboten fr noch unbewusstes material sein knnen ich wei dass sich diese diskrepanz am ehesten dadurch auflsen lsst dass ich mein empfinden mitteile ich habe vielfach erfahren wie ein solches vorgehen dazu beitrgt eine spaltung zwischen den personen hier die traurigkeit

diskrepanz in mir und zwischen uns antwortet die patientin berraschend und sagt ich bin dumm sie erlutert ihre empfindung mit einem literarischen bild das mir die selbstverdummung als schutzmechanismus erklrt das legt mir den gedanken nahe dass ich gefhle von traurigkeit ber die auswirkungen des missbrauchs empfinde die ihr noch unbewusst sind ich gelange so zur annahme einer introjektiven identifizierung mein mir fremdes gefhl von traurigkeit enthlt die von mir introjizierten affekte ich war eindeutig mit diesem gefhl identifiziert es war mein gefhl ber dessen ursprung ich mir gedanken machte und zugleich war es dem noch unbewussten empfinden meiner patientin nahe die deutung des zusammenhangs selbstverdummung als schutz vor den auswirkungen des traumatischen geschehens wirkt befreiend meine patientin findet ihre traurigkeit wieder die traurigkeit die ich zu stundenbeginn diskontinuierlich empfinde kann als eine vorwegnahme eine vorleistung des analytikers

scientific prevention and treatment programs 4 5  in the recent past two other novel coronaviruses covs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 have emerged and the world is placed on high alert 6 7  they have similar symptoms while sars-cov and mers-cov have low potential for sustained community transmission 8  infections and deaths of sars-cov and mers-cov are less than 2019-ncov thus the previous prediction model is no longer suitable for 2019-ncov 9  in this study we provide state transition matrix model to predict the 2019-ncov infection peak and patient distribution more importantly from a public health viewpoint we then estimate the risk metrics infectivity severity and lethality of the ncp we set up six different scenarios in order to control for model error so we can identify the close contactpatients state by utilizing a state vector at any moment medical

contact of a known infected patient is identified and put into medical observation in the next day outcome could be any of the three confirmed infection discharged without infection or stay in mo discharge dis is a terminal state for a close contact until he or she becomes another incident of close contact again infected is an intermediate state where the patient becomes a confirmed infected case the outcome is binary severe or non-severe and the outcome is revealed immediately non-severe ins is the patient also has three possible outcomes in the next day cure severe or stay in non-severe infected and severe is the patient has three possible outcomes in the next day death non-severe or stay in severe cure cu is also a terminal state for the patient death d is a terminal state for the patient so at any moment we can identify the close contactpatients state by utilizing a state vector defined as the following where each element of the vector stands for one state in the same

is revealed instantaneously so we combine infected with severe and non-severe lets define the state transition matrix as the following suppose we have a state vector vt for a sample population at time t how do we predict the state vector vt1 in the next day apply simple linear algebra we can get the following equation since the head count of a certain state comes from itself all other possible transitions into the state eg ins has two possible income states mo and is minus the outcome states is and cu if we want to predict for n period the equation becomes the following if the population is limited and the transition matrix is stationary the above formula will be sufficient in predicting all future outcomes in our case the population is not fixed so we need to introduce the additional

50 the epidemic will slowly increase in the first half of 2020 and will not reach its peak 9  the difficulty of the current epidemic control is that when these patients were admitted to the hospital

bring the global victory nevertheless there are still limitations primarily critical or severe cases will be affected by the gradually rational allocation of treatment teams and medical resources the strengthening of medical power or virus toxicity decreasing as a result the peak time might arrive earlier than our estimates secondly the impact of seasonal factors has not been considered and supposing 2019-ncov is affected by the season our prediction results may be unreliable hence if these indicators continue to change the model could have opportunities for improvement in addition due to the characteristics of severe and critical cases there may be a huge impact on factors such as age and complex underlying diseases therefore with the increasing awareness of the severity of the disease and the strengthening of prevention and control in various sectors of the society various indicators may be reduced at the same time because of the instability of the previous indicators these dynamic changes may affect the predictive efficacy of the model we can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing and

covid-19 and its risk factors in the portuguese population is critical to combat this condition to study the impact of multimorbidity in the population with covid-19 infection we performed a descriptive analysis of a dataset extracted from all reported confirmed cases of covid-19 in portugal until april 28 2020 we observed a prevalence of multimorbidity in 449 of the 19598 infected patients patients showed an increased risk of hospitalization icu admission and mortality with or 270 ci 95 252-288 for every additional morbidity further studies should confirm these findings and special attention should be made on data collection to ensure proper recording of patient comorbidities  in this work we evaluate the prevalence of multimorbidity and age-adjusted risk of hospitalization icu admission and death in the portuguese population from official data based on a dataset extracted from sinave containing all confirmed cases of covid-19 in portugal by april 28 2020 this retrospective observational study used data provided by dgs after the required institutional and ethical approvals the sample population consists of all the portuguese population with sars-cov2 confirmed infection as notified by clinicians by april 28 2020 a broad range of clinical and demographic variables are present in this dataset in this study we specifically used age gender hospital admission admission in intensive care unit mortality and patients underlying conditions chronic conditions were provided as a categorical variable on the presence or absence of the following conditions asthma malignancy cardiac disorder including hypertension chronic hematological disorder diabetes hivother immune deficiency renal disease liver disease chronic lung disease and neuromuscular disorder we defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more conditions in the same individual following the definition used by other authors 6  addressed outcomes were hospitalization admission to icu unit and reported death a composite outcome of any of these events was also analyzed we used python 36 and packages numpy pandas seaborn and scipy in combination with microsoft excel to evaluate and plot the prevalence of multimorbidity additionally ibm spss statistics was used for obtaining age-adjusted risk of hospitalisation icu admission and death categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages with 95 confidence intervals and comparisons were made using using the  2 test univariate regression analysis of each individual chronic condition was performed adjusting only for age a multivariate logistic regression was performed adjusting for age and every other chronic condition with significant statistical association on univariate analysis results were considered significant when p 005 the overall sample contained 19598 patient cases women being more prevalent 5892 among the cases 1639 had at least one chronic condition

line with previous reports where chronic diseases are associated with poorer outcomes 3 7  although the strength of association differs between diseases every additional morbidity leads to an increased risk of the composite outcome of hospitalization icu admission and mortality multimorbidity was previously studied in the general portuguese population in 2014 by laires et al using data from the fifth national health interview survey inqurito nacional de sade ins 6  prevalence of multimorbidity on the laires at al study can be compared with our data although only individuals aged 25-79 were included in that study this constitutes a robust sample for morbidity prevalence in portugal we can observe in figure 1 to figure 3 a rise in chronic health conditions with increasing age as expected however multimorbidity is much less prevalent in our study population 449 vs 439 since the beginning of this pandemic there has been significant public awareness regarding the higher risk of older people with comorbidities this may have induced efforts to protect and isolate this population the findings of this study could thus confirm the positive effect of such measures given the younger and healthier population in the covid-19 dataset the discrepancy may however be related to different reporting methods for instance the maximum number of reported simultaneous morbidities in the covid-19 infected population was only 5 disorders which is half of the maximum number of morbidities found in the ins population 10 disorders since the total number of conditions between both datasets is not so different covid-19 10 diseases ins 13 diseases a possible explanation for the higher number of co-occurring conditions in the ins population can be the combination of self-diagnoses with the presence of more subjective disorders such as lower and upper back pain allergies depression and urinary incontinence this study has several limitations first of all the cross-sectional nature of the covid-19 dataset makes it impossible to account for incomplete outcomes since several patients could ultimately be hospitalized or die after the end of observation reported data on outcomes may therefore be underestimated so careful interpretation is advised until more data is available more importantly despite the fact that no standard set of conditions is established to define multimorbidity chronic conditions were given on broad groups and there is no specific information on individual conditions for example diabetes is given as one group and no distinction is made between type 1 and type 2 diabetes therefore measured morbidities may herald heterogeneous groups of diseases with different degrees of severity which may influence outcomes future datasets should include more accurate information on chronic conditions another important concern is related to the risk of under-reporting in this dataset which becomes obvious by analyzing reported cardiac diseases given that cardiovascular diseases particularly hypertension are very prevalent in the portuguese population 8  the observed prevalence of 028 in our study highly suggests that under-reporting may have occurred we could notice that surprisingly cardiovascular diseases are absent from the available list of previous conditions in sinaves reporting page as seen in figure 6b  which could have contributed to a lower notification of this comorbidity 5 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license

this dataset was not primarily designed for research but rather for public health proceedings and government information we believe that a better user interface design and a more rational set of chronic conditions could effortlessly improve the quality of recorded data one important lesson we can learn from this pandemic is the important contribution that quickly gathered relevant clinical data and health information systems such as sinave can have in this setting overall we consider sinave to be very susceptible to under-reporting specially regarding multimorbidity this is due to a confusing and non-practical interface that allows doctors to skip filling some important fields in the entry form some suggestions to improve future studies regarding multimorbidity using sinaves data are  redesign the reporting form making data entry more effective and faster the current user interface could be simplified while encouraging the input of relevant comorbidity information  integrate sinave data with the patients health record or with data from the new trace covid-19 system to provide richer data relevant to covid-19 this could be a way of implementing the redesigned user interface suggested above  make it mandatory to input if comorbidities are absent if present the filling of the entry form inputs related to comorbidities and the specific chronic conditions should be mandatory as seen in figure 6  the list of comorbidities only becomes visible if a previous parameter is filled  make the entry of all known chronic conditions by healthcare professionals more persuasive  add cardiovascular diseases to the list of comorbidities to conclude findings in our study show that multimorbidity is significantly associated with poor outcomes in covid-19 infection further data is needed to inform about the strength of this association and about the significance of observed differences in multimorbidity prevalence between infected patients and the general population of portugal we believe that data collection problems may have occurred and influenced outcome measurement we also provide recommendations for improving the data collection user interface that could improve quality of health information about the covid-19 infected population while increasing confidence in sinave data 6 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission was not

increased in the lungs of patients with comorbidities associated with severe covid-19 bruna pinto gg antonio oliveira er youvika singh leandro jimenez andre gonalves n rodrigo ogava lt rachel creighton jean peron pierre helder nakaya i   recent studies of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 have revealed that severe infection is more likely in people with an existing chronic medical condition two independent studies of infected populations in wuhan china found that approximately half the subjects infected with covid-19 had an existing comorbidity 1 2 in a study of 1099 patients across mainland china 387 of patients with comorbidities progressed to severe infection 3 2020 and in a study of 52 inpatients in wuhan 67 of patients with comorbidities died 2 the most common comorbidities reported in these studies were hypertension diabetes cerebrovascular disease chronic obstructive lung disease and coronary heart disease 13 other comorbidities such as carcinoma chronic kidney disease chronic liver disease digestive system disease and nervous system disease have also been reported in patients with covid-19 1 2 4 a better understanding of the link between these conditions and covid-19 infection is required to inform better treatment and prevention interventions the molecular mechanism responsible for the increased disease severity in patients with these comorbidities is not fully understood but previous studies suggest a role for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 5 ace2 is a membrane protein required for sars-cov2 to bind and enter cells 68 after binding viral entry is facilitated by the activation of the viral spike glycoprotein and cleavage of the c-terminal segment of ace2 by proteases like tmprss2 and furin that are readily expressed in lung tissue 911 ace2 is only moderately expressed in healthy lung tissue compared to the heart kidneys and testes 12 but staining of lung tissue sections from adults with pulmonary hypertension has revealed increased ace2 protein in the endothelium of pulmonary arteries compared to healthy controls 13 ace2 upregulation has also been observed in animal models of liver fibrosis 14 however the reason for this upregulation remains unclear and a link to other covid-19 comorbidities has not been determined here we showed that ace2 expression in lung tissue is upregulated by diseases representing comorbidities along with covid-19 we also used systems biology approaches including co-expression analysis meta-analysis and network analysis to determine a potential cause of the ace2 upregulation from this analysis we found that ace2 expression could be regulated by enzymes that modify histones including kdm5b this identification of a common molecular mechanism of increased covid-19 severity in patients with diverse comorbidities could direct the development of interventions to reduce the infection risk and disease severity in this population relevant scientific literature related to key covid-19 morbidities was retrieved from pubmed for terms returning more than 100000 papers hypertension smoking and asthma only the most recent 100000 papers were analyzed full papers and abstracts were annotated to identify all genes diseases and species appearing in the title or abstract using the pubtator central api 15 this open source tool uses taggerone for disease annotations gnormplus for gene annotations and sr4gn for species annotations 15 the data were filtered to retain only papers containing a human species annotation next every possible combination of gene and disease annotation within the title and abstract of each paper was generated only gene-disease terms with at least four documents supporting it and those with a proximity less than or equal to the median sentence length of the paper section were retained gene ids were converted to gene symbols using the biomart r package 16 17 and disease ids were converted to disease mesh terms using the entrez programming utilities to query the entrez database provided by the national center for biotechnology information the data was then further filtered to retain disease mesh terms relevant to reported clinical covid-19 comorbidities 3 redundant terms were collapsed using fuzzy string matching the final gene-disease data set was used to generate a network utilizing gephi software where the nodes were genes and diseases and the edge weight was determined by the number of analyzed papers containing the gene-disease combination 18 we manually curated gene expression omnibus geo repository httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgeo to find lung and blood transcriptome datasets related to pulmonary arterial hypertension pah chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd severe acute respiratory syndrome sars h1n1 influenza tuberculosis and smoking author-normalized expression values and metadata from these datasets were downloaded using the geoquery package 19 we performed differential expression analyses between patients with a disease and the control individuals see table s1 using the limma package 20 the gene symbol for each probe was obtained from the annotation file 21 probes that matched the same gene symbol were collapsed by taking the one with the lowest p-value meta-analysis was performed with the metavolcanor package 22 by combining the p-values using fishers method we calculated the false discovery rate fdr to identify the differentially expressed genes fdr  005 for enrichment analyses we utilized the enrichr tool 23 with the go biological process 2018 and bioplanet 2019 databases we then selected pathways with an adjusted p-value  005 the network was created in cytoscape 24 to identify the genes highly associated with key comorbidities of severe covid-19 1 3 we mined all relevant scientific literature of these human diseases specifically over 8000 abstracts containing the terms pulmonary hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hypertension smoking pulmonary fibrosis or asthma in the title or abstract were selected figure 1a our text-mining analysis revealed 804 genes highly associated with one or more covid-19 morbidities figure 1b among those genes 26 were associated with four or more diseases figure 1c although ace2 was known to be related to cardiovascular diseases familial primary pulmonary hypertension hypertension pulmonary and hypertension none of the articles containing this gene-disease association studied how ace2 expression was altered in the lungs of patients with these diseases seven lung transcriptome studies of patients with either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd or pulmonary arterial hypertension pah as well as smoking volunteers compared to individuals who were non-smoking volunteers were downloaded and used in our meta-analysis table s1 for each study we performed differential expression analysis between patients and control individuals table s1 by combining the p-values obtained in all the seven comparisons we were able to identify 1740 and 938 genes that were respectively up- and down-regulated in the disease figure 2a enrichment analysis using these differentially expressed genes revealed several pathways associated with inflammatory processes metabolism and er stress among the pathways enriched with down-regulated genes there were vasculogenesis and regulation of notch signaling pathway figure 2b the viral life cycle pathway which describes the processes utilized by viruses to ensure survival and to attach and enter the host cells was enriched with up-regulated genes figure 2b ace2 was included in this pathway as well as 25 other genes figure 2c one of these genes is rab1a rab gtpases are involved in the replication of many viruses infecting humans 25 but have not been associated with sars-cov-2 life cycle yet both tmprss2 gene which is required for sars-cov-2 cell entry 5 and furin gene which cleaves sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein 26 were not differentially expressed in most of the lung transcriptome however both genes were highly expressed in lung data not shown suggesting that the levels of ace2 may be the limiting factor for viral infection we then decided to investigate whether ace2 was specifically up-regulated in the lungs of patients having one of these morbidities figure 3a since cancer is also listed as a relevant co-morbidity 3 we analyzed an rna-seq data of patients with lung adenocarcinoma 27 ace2 was expressed in 59 of cancer samples and only in 25 of adjacent lung normal samples figure 3b among the samples expressing ace2 the level of the gene was higher in cancer compared to the adjacent normal lung tissue figure 3b in another lung rna-seq dataset we compared ace2 expression between patients with copd and subjects with normal spirometry 28 again the expression of ace2 was significantly up-regulated in the disease compared to controls figure 3c in fact ace2 was significantly up-regulated in 6 out of 7 lung transcriptome studies figure 3de suggesting that patients who have copd or pah and even people who smoke may have higher chances of developing severe covid-19 co-expression analyses can provide useful insights about the functional role of genes and their regulatory mechanisms 29 we performed pearson correlation between the expression of ace2 and all other genes in each of the seven lung transcriptome studies table s1 combined the p-values using fishers method and applied an fdr correction figure 4a this approach identified 544 and 173 genes with positive and negative correlation with ace2 respectively figure 4a several of these genes were related to histone modifications such as hat1 hdac2 kdm5b among others figure 4a among the positively correlated genes we found adam10 that regulates ace2 cleavage in human airway epithelia 30 and tlr3 that plays a key role in the innate response to sars-cov or mers-cov infection 31 pathway enrichment analysis revealed that several of the genes positively associated with ace2 were regulated by kdm5b and by specific histone acetylation h3k27ac and histone methylation h3k4me1 and h3k4me3 figure 4b in fact kmd5b demethylates lysine 4 of histone h3 ie h3k4 and is involved in transcriptional regulation and dna repair 32 we then checked in the roadmap epigenomics project database 33 to see whether ace2 locus contained chip-seq information for these histone markers in the human lung peaks for h3k4me1 and h3k4me3 as well as h3k27ac were identified in ace2 locus figure 4c suggesting that ace2 may be epigenetically regulated in the lung the current diabetes pandemic 34 could be worsening the sars-cov-2 pandemic by increasing the comorbidities associated with severe covid-19 as we did not find lung transcriptome samples from patients with type 2 diabetes we could not directly test whether ace2 expression was increased in patients with diabetes compared to healthy controls however our text-mining approach revealed that il-6 and ins genes were associated with all the diseases we searched the ins gene encodes the insulin hormone and insulin is associated with the nad-dependent histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 sirt1 35 we found that sirt1 was up-regulated in the lung of patients with severe covid-19 comorbidities in 4 out 7 studies data not shown clarke et al 36 have demonstrated that under conditions of cell energy stress sirt1 can epigenetically regulate ace2 others too have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may inhibit the sirt1 deacetylase activity 37 which in turn could impact ace2 expression the viral life cycle pathway that was enriched with up-regulated genes in patients with severe covid-19 comorbidities contains several genes other than ace2 that can be potentially important for sars-cov-2 cell cycle and invasionattachment these include rab1a gene whose product promotes the replication of vaccinia virus 38 also rab1a is important for herpes simplex virus 1 secondary envelopment 39 and is required for assembly of classical swine fever virus particle 40 it is possible that sars-cov-2 utilizes rab1a as well the fact that ace2 gene is located in the x chromosome and the initial findings showing that older males with comorbidities are more likely to be have severe covid-19 compared to females 1 indicate that ace2 expression in the lung may be sex-biased although no significant sexual differences was found in the activity of ace2 in mouse lung 41 in rats the levels of ace2 were dramatically reduced with aging in both genders but with significantly higher ace2 expression in old female rats than male 42 although the mechanisms by which ace2 is up-regulated in patients with severe covid-19 comorbidities were not addressed our analysis may shed some light on the subject among the genes whose expression was positively correlated with ace2 we detected genes associated with epigenetic regulation of gene transcription for instance hat and hdac modulate chromatin and dna condensation by changing histone acetylation status thus permitting gene transcription this could be happening in lung tissue facilitating ace2 expression as observed during lung cancer and copd kdm5b is associated with infection of hepatitis b virus 43 in breast cancer cells blockage of kdm5 triggers a robust interferon response that results in resistance to infection by dna and rna viruses 44 this finding suggests that kdm5 demethylases are potential targets for preventing sars-cov-2 infection covid-19 may kill between 56 and 152 of people infected with sars-cov-2 45 drug treatments that lower this mortality rate may save many thousands of lives our systems biology approach offers putative gene targets for treating and preventing severe covid-19 cases  telemedicine platforms and their use in the coronavirus disease-19 era to deliver comprehensive vascular care judith lin c misty humphries d william shutze p oliver aalami o uwe fischer m kim hodgson j   telehealth is the umbrella term which encompasses the five major categories of virtual care with varying levels of reimbursement mobile health includes provision of public health information through mobile devices remote patient monitoring includes the use of connected electronic tool to record personal health and medical data wearable technologies send information directly to the medical record though app platforms and include bluetooth enabled glucose monitoring systems used in endocrinology or home blood pressure monitors virtual check-ins are patient-initiated brief communications that connect with patients through the electronic medical records emr or a secure platform telemedicine is a visit with a provider using two-way interactive audio and video so that there is real-time communication between the provider and the patient there are two main pathways for telemedicine video visits with a patient who is likely at home telemedicine clinic with an originating site and distant site the originating site is where the patient is located and the distant site is where the provider conducting the visit is located one of the most important things is to set up a private computer workstation with audio-video capability and dual monitors for telemedicine having the device on a stand allows you to conduct the visit check the chart and type at the same time during the visit a dual-screen computer set-up allows for reviewing images and charting during the telehealth visits a digital clock to keep track of the length of telemedicine visit may be helpful for billing large health systems have the capability to provide hipaa compliant video visits from within the emr examples include epic and cerner if this capability has not been implemented or if you work in a smaller practice stand alone hipaa compliant telemedicine solutions exist these include doxyme google g suite hangouts meet gotomeeting intouch health mend mundaii skype for business swymed updox vsee zoom for healthcare these secured platforms may be used by providers in their private office to perform telemedicine visits epic emr allows for easy to use video visit platform for patients through the patients mychart application or it may be called by your hospitals name providers may use haiku on the phone or cantu on a tablet performing a telemedicine visit in epic is simple and can be done by two methods the first method entails going into the providers schedule and selecting the appropriate chart the telemedicine icon is found on the bottom of the screen and selected the second method is by going into the notifications section of the epic app if the patient has entered their video visit the notification can be selected and the provider is taken into the patients chart and the appropriate video visit if the patient has entered the visit there will be a green display when the patients video is live and they are ready the provider should wait until the patient is in the virtual waiting first to avoid patients hearing conversations with other physicians or nursing staff about potentially private health information an additional feature of the epic platform is for image capture while in the video visit this is performed using the using the camera icon displayed at the bottom of the visit interaction screen epic can then automatically import images captured for the encounter into a note by using the smart phase images this is a systems-based phrase and will insert all images from that encounter into the note these images can be placed in the chart as part of the physical exam finally the epic platform allows the camera flip option this allows the provider to show patients computed tomography ct ultrasound or x-ray images for the visit certain patients are particularly suited to a telemedicine visit these include postoperative patients having an unremarkable and uncomplicated convalescence chronic vascular patients who need surveillance with or without vascular imaging represent another group that can frequently be managed remotely established patience exhibiting a new complaint can be initially evaluated with a virtual visit and triaged towards an office visit hospitalization or delay visit new referral patients can be evaluated initially through telehealth in order to determine whether they need to be seen immediately urgently or they can be delayed as well until the risks of the viral pandemic have diminished disadvantages include the inability to perform an in-person physical exam pulse exam wound probing etc or perform any procedures wound debridement drainage suture removal etcthe goals of incorporating telemedicine into the community vascular surgeons practice are to keep the physical office waiting room as empty as possible but to keep the virtual waiting room full it is also to keep the surgeons providers and other staff working and on the payroll telemedicine allows the vascular surgery practice to maintain a revenue stream to support these aspirations after choosing a telemedicine platform obtaining the necessary hardware is critical which includes a computer desktop or laptop microphone and camera some physicians may use a smart phone primarily or as a backup the practice will need to have a standardized script regarding telemedicine and a workflow process figure 1
 the patient will also require access to the appropriate computer hardware setup or a smart phone the appointment schedules are then evaluated well in advance and the appropriate patients are selected for a possible telemedicine visit they are then contacted and offered the opportunity for a telemedicine visit if they have the necessary devices if they provide their consent and have the appropriate equipment their visit is then flagged in the office scheduling software as a telemedicine visit if an imaging study is required this is to be scheduled in advance of the visit if possible if not it can be scheduled to follow the visit with another telemedicine visit to discuss the results before starting telemedicine it is important to coordinate with the back-office or billing company this will be necessary to identify which payors are not reimbursing for telemedicine as well as to make sure that these patients visits are appropriately flagged in the system so that the correct modifier can be attached as the largest integrated national healthcare delivery system in the us the veterans administration va provides care for nearly 9 million veterans by 180000 medical professionals the va uses the veterans health information systems and technology architecture vista based computerized patient record system cprs as its ehr system cprs has neither secure messaging nor video-conferencing features built directly into the graphical user interface gui however the office of connected care was established in 2016 with the mission to extend access to care beyond the traditional office visit including myhealthyvet patient portal va telehealth services and va mobile applications scaling these foundational programs has been instrumental in response to the increased demands during the current covid-19 pandemic the myhealthyvet patient portal provides asynchronous secure messaging from within the patient health record phr where the patient can also review results and schedule appointments home video visits are conducted through the va video connect vvc system because vvc is a web-based app it does not require patients to register into a portal to launch only apple ios devices such as iphones and ipads require downloading of a mobile application patients simply tap the hyperlink in their appointment email which launches a browser to initiate the video visit since the covid-19 pandemic the number telemedicine visits has increased nearly 200-fold in visn 21 and were essential to maintaining patient care while minimizing patient clinic and hospital visitations a digital health revolution is fueled by an increase in the prevalence of both smartphones and connected devices a valuable digital health use case is for post-operative surgical site infection ssi monitoring ssis have been reported to be 8 or higher in vascular surgery patients and a significant cause for readmissions8 applications to proactively engage patients at home prior to their follow-up visit to assess post-operative wound status can be implemented these are typically asynchronous store and forward communication solutions which including photos or videos hcpcs code g2010 is used for a virtual check-in when a recorded video andor photo is submitted by an established patient this requires an interpretation and a follow-up communication within 24 hours the encounter may not be originating from a related em service provided within the previous 7 days and may not lead to an em service within 24 hours following the virtual check-in remote management of chronic conditions may improve health outcomes and lower costs programs to manage hypertension diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure are well-established in certain health systems established patients with a well-defined diagnosis are asked to purchase a connected device such as a bluetooth connected blood pressure cuff for a digital hypertension program to measure their blood pressure at home this data automatically syncs to the electronic medical record via the patients smartphone for the mid-level provider or pharmacist to review and make medication changes ochsner health systems digital hypertension program achieved target blood pressure control in 71 of its digital-medicine program versus 31 of the usual-care patients at 90 days9 remote monitoring allows for more frequent patient check-ins with the intent of more rapid achievement of treatment goals and prevention of complications an added benefit is for health coaches to leverage these programs to address behavioral health by providing health education on smoking cessation nutrition and exercise peripheral artery disease pad is poised for remote monitoring particularly in the early stages when patients suffer from claudication studies to clinically validate sensors in smartphones and smartwatches in patients with pad have been conducted to help set the foundation for remote tracking10 despite supervised exercise therapy set being a grade 1 and level a recommendation in svs guidelines for claudicants utilization is quite poor11 one solution would be to address this with a smartphone delivered home based supervised exercise therapy program to schedule exercise sessions measure effort and report compliance while providing pad smoking cessation diet and exercise education with the support of health coaches remote monitoring programs are a form of telehealth and have the advantage of continuing to be effective during periods of covid-19 lockdown the workflow for a regular office visit from referral to billing consists of multiple levels and is comparable to the workflow for telehealth visits the complexity however can cause problems during conversion of a scheduled office visit to a telehealth visit the number of potential pitfalls is even higher if the conversion process must occur rapidly as was the case at the beginning of the covid-19 era while many challenges depend on the utilized telehealth platform and the necessary prerequisites both on patient and provider side the presence of an infrastructure and experience with telehealth at the health system cannot be overstated while all steps are logical implementing the conversion of regular office visits to remote visits depend largely on the close interaction between provider medical assistant and scheduler the larger obstacles such as restrictions of other departments involved in our patient care must be considered and the vascular provider will have to make the decision on whether the test or diagnostic imaging is necessary or can be deferred lastly the individual providers experience understanding of and bias toward the telemedicine approach must be considered training in person or via training videos is essential to provide the necessary understanding of the process including scheduling documentation of and billing for the telehealth in general while the conversion process to telemedicine during a short period is challenging the workflow issues can be overcome with adequate training and close collaboration of all involved parties best practice would be to schedule traditional in-person visits and telemedicine visits as separate blocks for efficiency the setup and workflow for each is very different in addition telemedicine patients tend to be on time because the 15-minute block locks out after the time is up as many challenges as the covid 19 era poses it is also a chance for vascular surgeons to adopt and establish an additional modality of patient care that is not only highly appreciated by the patients but also safe and effective without compromising quality of care to perform telemedicine physicians must be licensed in one the states figure 2
 interstate medical licensure compact imlc is an agreement between 29 states the district of columbia and the territory of guam under this agreement licensed physicians can qualify to practice medicine across state lines within the compact if they meet the agreed upon eligibility requirements12 approximately 80 of physicians meet the criteria for licensure through the imlc during the pandemic cms has waived the interstate licensing restriction allowing physicians to practice across state lines center for medicare and medicaid services cms has approved cpt codes for telehealth in 2018 table i

 regardless of coverage receiving and providing telehealth medicine is not prohibited rather the controversy lies in its reimbursement and coverage large commercial insurers such as aetna bluecross blue shield cigna humana unitedhealthcare and more are moving to expand telehealth coverage some states have telemedicine parity laws mandating equal reimbursement for telemedicine and in-person care by commercial payers cms has lifted medicare restrictions on the use of telehealth services during the covid-19 emergency here are the six key changeseffective for services starting march 6 2020 and for the duration of the covid-19 public health emergency medicare will make payment for medicare telehealth services furnished to patients in broader circumstancesthese visits are considered the same as in-person visits and are paid at the same rate as regular in-person visitsmedicare will make payment for professional services furnished to beneficiaries in all areas of the country in all settingswhile they must generally travel to or be located in certain types of originating sites such as a physicians office skilled nursing facility or hospital for the visit medicare will make payment for telehealth services furnished to beneficiaries in any healthcare facility and in their homethe medicare coinsurance and deductible would generally apply to these services however the hhs office of inspector general oig is providing flexibility for healthcare providers to reduce or waive cost-sharing for telehealth visits paid by federal healthcare programsto the extent the 1135 waiver requires an established relationship hhs will not conduct audits to ensure that such a prior relationship existed for claims submitted during this public health emergency
 at these virtual town hall meetings the panelists learned from each other about their vascular practices protocols and preferences through this difficult time during the pandemic the use of telemedicine has grown exponentially at many institutions and vascular surgery practices around the country our next challenge will be deciding on how to best deploy those limited resources to take care of vascular patients once surgery restrictions are lifted while stay-at-home orders have slowed the spread of the virus and flattened the curve the threat of viral infection will continue until we develop and administer a vaccine as states ease restrictions the country will likely experience further regional spikes and waves of infection although the risk of dying from covid-19 may be low in healthy patients vascular patients are a vulnerable population due to their co-morbidities and advanced age next step in evidence-based practice would focus on patient-reported satisfaction and clinical outcomes using telemedicine for the management of vascular disease via comparative effectiveness studies continuing telemedicine where appropriate minimizes viral exposure risk and offers convenience benefits for patients during these unprecedented times we encourage everyone to keep open communications and share our best practices  journal pre-proof la certificacion de la defuncion de

en el ltimo tercio del siglo xix por varios motivos por un lado la mayor proximidad asistencial del mdico al moribundo en el mbito urbano junto con la fundamentacin cientfica de la higiene pblica que en gran parte se apoy en el desarrollo de la estadstica sanitaria y de la prevencin pblica esto tambin dio lugar a nuevas legislaciones y cdigos civiles y al origen de los registros civiles adems la incorporacin de la estadstica sanitaria llev a la internacionalizacin de la prevencin de la enfermedad a fines del siglo xix casi todos los pases europeos tenan sistemas centralizados de registros de mortalidad en 1871 tras varios intentos se logr la puesta en marcha del registro civil rc en espaa 2  este avance vino precedido por un periodo de transicin que supuso la implantacin de un j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f registro parcial provincial para grandes y medianas poblaciones en el ao 1841 la ley exiga a todos los municipios la creacin de un rc en el que se deban inscribir los datos referentes al estado civil de todos los espaoles nacimientos matrimonios defunciones etc al margen de sus creencias un siglo ms tarde en 1957 se constat la necesidad de actualizar y renovar la ley entonces vigente adaptndola a las necesidades de la poca dando lugar a la ley de 8 de segn el reglamento que desarrolla la ley del rc debe cumplimentar el cmd-bed el facultativo que haya asistido al difunto en su ltima enfermedad o cualquier otro que reconozca el cadver 7 el cdigo de deontologa mdica cd 8 regula el compromiso de certificar la muerte sealando que aunque el mdico que haya tenido la mayor carga asistencial sobre el paciente es el que tiene la mayor responsabilidad tica de cumplimentar el certificado de defuncin en todos sus apartados no es deontolgicamente aceptable rehuir el compromiso de certificarla cuando se produce si se ha presenciado la misma se conoce al paciente o se tiene a disposicin la historia clnica en el reverso del primer impreso del cmd-bed encontramos unas instrucciones bsicas de certificacin figura 1 que establece la oms para seguir a la hora de cumplimentar el certificado cuando se trata de muertes violentas o sospechosas de criminalidad no procede la firma del cmd-bed derivndose estas muertes a investigacin judicial 9  el procedimiento general de manejo y notificacin de los fallecimientos se recoge en la figura 2 el cmd-bed es un documento mdico-legal en el que el profesional debe poner el mismo esfuerzo y dedicacin que en el resto de los informes elaborados en vida del paciente clnica y ticamente se puede firmar un certificado con criterios de presuncin si el desenlace es posible y hay compatibilidad entre la informacin sobre las circunstancias del fallecimiento y su patobiografa no siendo aceptable en cambio no firmarlo escudndose en un posible delito de falsedad que recoge el cdigo penal en nuestra experiencia y la de otros autores se confirma que difcilmente se perseguir a un mdico que de buena fe y previa exploracin del paciente certifique como natural una muerte que no lo sea 10 siendo un deber tico la cumplimentacin del cmd-bed en esta situacin se prioriza el ahorro de sufrimiento a los familiares por delante de las dudas legales no razonables humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas 11  desde su publicacin en 2009 el cmd-bed ha sufrido alguna modificacin en la primera versin del cmd-bed las hoy llamadas causas intermedias se denominaban tambin causas antecedentes tras menos de dos aos el ine comprob que se estaba cumplimentando equivocadamente dicha variable y elabor un documento que hizo llegar a los mdicos a travs de los cm 12 en l se recoga que muchos mdicos han interpretado este campo como antecedentes clnicos y no como debera entenderse es decir anotar en las llamadas causas antecedentes aquellos procesos que siendo debidos a la causa inicial produjeron la causa inmediata de muerte recientemente se han modificado incorporando cdigo qr y recogiendo el nmero de colegiacin de nueve cifras estableciendo las casillas de forma independiente para su adecuada cumplimentacin la correcta cumplimentacin del cmd-bed tiene importantes consecuencias desde el punto de vista de poltica sanitaria en base a ellos el ine extrae de estos documentos las causas de defuncin con los que genera las estadsticas oficiales de mortalidad segn los resultados obtenidos se toman medidas de prevencin y se destinarn los recursos necesarios para afrontar las necesidades existentes mediante la implementacin de polticas sanitarias no cumplimentar adecuadamente las causas de muerte figura 3 puede tener una gran importancia desde el punto de vista epidemiolgico 13 derivando como consecuencia de esto en una mala organizacin de los recursos destinados a la salud tanto en la investigacin de enfermedades como en la implantacin de polticas preventivas j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f existe poca experiencia en nuestro medio en relacin a la certificacin de fallecimientos durante las epidemias se entiende que si se producen mltiples fallecimientos los procedimientos de actuacin podran ser semejantes a los de situaciones de catstrofe como sostienen barbera et al 14 las catstrofes constituyen un problema de salud pblica al ser susceptibles de incrementar la morbilidad y mortalidad y disminuir la calidad de vida las epidemias cumplen evidentemente estas condiciones el papel de la certificacin de las causas de la muerte en el caso de grandes catstrofes corresponde a la medicina forense 15 y el de la certificacin en epidemias corresponde a la medicina asistencial 16 pero la comparacin puede ser til en el establecimiento de procedimientos para el manejo de cadveres y la certificacin de la muerte en casos de mltiples fallecimientos en epidemias 17  quiz el nico ejemplo que tenemos en espaa de epidemias con mltiples fallecimientos y con registros de los mismos es la pandemia de gripe de 1918 su estallido gener mltiples estudios cientficos anlisis estadsticos y una fuerte reaccin de la prensa a partir de mayo de 1918 fue una experiencia terrible para la sociedad que gener mltiples medidas para combatirla por parte de los gobiernos y respuestas extraordinarias por parte de los profesionales de la salud y de la poblacin en general los estudios sobre la pandemia de gripe de 1918 han comprendido no slo el anlisis de los datos de morbi-mortalidad que son muy importantes en si mismos sino que tambin ha llevado a una comprensin de la epidemia ms all de las cifras para poder evaluar las repercusiones que la epidemia tuvo sobre la mortalidad contamos con la informacin contenida en los movimientos naturales de poblacin elaborados por el ine y con los boletines mensuales de demografa sanitaria que confeccionaba el ministerio de la gobernacin estos datos sin embargo son insuficientes para descender a detalles por ejemplo los relacionados con los distritos de las ciudades porras 18 ha estudiado la estadstica demogrfica que confeccionaba anualmente el servicio de estadstica del ayuntamiento de madrid as como los resmenes generales anuales de esas estadsticas demogrficas el cruce de esos datos con los fondos del rc y los libros de defuncin correspondientes a los aos 1918 y 1919 ha permitido determinar con detalle la evolucin de la morbi-mortalidad de la pandemia en espaa 19  sin embargo ayer como hoy las cifras de mortalidad cambiaban segn los criterios que se aplicaban as por ejemplo en el caso de madrid las tasas brutas de mortalidad general y especfica de 1918 y 1919 que se obtenan a partir de los datos del rc y de los resmenes generales anuales de las estadsticas demogrficas del ayuntamiento de madrid eran muy diferentes ya que civilmente las muertes se consignaron en el distrito correspondiente a su j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f lugar de fallecimiento mientras que el ayuntamiento elabor sus estadsticas a partir de los datos de los cementerios donde las muertes se anotaban en el distrito en el que se resida y no en el que se mora es un ejemplo de la complejidad de los estudios de morbimortalidad histricos 18 20 recomendaciones nacionales e internacionales sobre la certificacin mdica de la defuncin en relacin al covid-19 el 29 de marzo de 2020 el cgcom emiti un comunicado en el que de acuerdo con las definiciones propuestas por la oms la vocala nacional de administraciones pblicas informaba acerca del procedimiento a seguir en la certificacin de las defunciones durante la actual epidemia de covid-19 16  el documento seala que las muertes producidas en una epidemia son muertes naturales no hace falta comunicar al mbito mdico-legal o judicial el fallecimiento la intervencin judicial del mdico forense se limitar a los casos de muerte violenta o en los que exista clara sospecha de criminalidad en esos casos en los que la investigacin de la muerte corresponde al mbito medico-legal el hecho de presentar una pcr sars-cov-2 positiva indica un dato de inters epidemiolgico que quiz deba tenerse en cuenta como factor agravante si la muerte se produce de forma diferida al hecho traumtico pero esa posible concausa corresponde analizarla al profesional forense en el resto de los casos la certificacin de la muerte corresponde a los mdicos asistenciales con independencia de que trabajen en un mbito pblico o privado en la misma lnea de lo recogido en otros pases de nuestro entorno 21 22  si previamente sealbamos que ante el fallecimiento de una persona se debe priorizar el ahorro de sufrimiento a los familiares por delante de las dudas legales no razonables a la hora de la certificacin humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas 11  en circunstancias como las vividas en esta pandemia este principio se hace mas necesario que nunca el documento del cgcom estableca dos escenarios a la hora de certificar muertes covid-19 el primero se refera a aquellos en los que no existe confirmacin analtica pero hay clnica compatible con la enfermedad en estas circunstancias se recomendaba certificar como covid-19 no confirmado o sospecha de infeccin por coronavirus como causa fundamental y como causa inmediata se propona usar fallo multiorgnico distrs respiratorio o insuficiencia respiratoria aguda sealando que podrn reflejarse causas intermedias si las hubiera o se conocieran como neumona sepsis o coagulopata el segundo escenario es aquel en el que los casos de covid 19 se han confirmado mediante test de laboratorio en esos casos la causa fundamental deber ser covid-19 confirmado para cualquiera de los escenarios anteriores un tema importante es cmo se registra la comorbilidad de los pacientes fallecidos por covid-19 23 24  el documento de la omc seala que en el apartado otros procesos debern recogerse las patologas o comorbilidades que conllevan un mayor riesgo de desarrollar enfermedad grave si existieran enfermedades cardiovasculares hipertensin arterial o diabetes en ocasiones se planea la disyuntiva de morir por covid-19 o morir con covid-19 pudiendo resultar complejo determinar si es la enfermedad covid-19 la causante del proceso de la muerte o lo es una patologa previa aqu slo cabe la reflexin del facultativo que firma el certificado a la vista de los datos de la evolucin clnica del paciente fallecido lo que puede requerir un estudio profundo de su historial mdico en todo caso el contenido de los cmd-bed es valorado con posterioridad por los profesionales de los registros de mortalidad permitiendo modificaciones de la causa fundamental tras el estudio de la historia clnica y la comunicacin en su caso con el profesional que en su momento hubiera certificado el fallecimiento el documento del cgcom se basaba en la gua internacional de la oms para la certificacin del covid-19 que posteriormente se ha modificado en una publicacin del 16 de abril de 2020 que recoge ejemplos para la certificacin de muertes no covid-19 25 en cuanto a la codificacin de las muertes la oms establece el cdigo u071 para los fallecimientos por covid-19 confirmados mediante estudio analtico y u072 para los fallecimientos sin test confirmatorios en los que el diagnostico se basa en criterios clnicos yo epidemiolgicos de covid-19 probable o sospechoso 26  a los efectos de toma de decisiones define y diferencia casos sospechosos o probables este documento define en los que sobreviven a la enfermedad como caso probable mientras no exista comunicacin telemtica puede ser til establecer procedimientos excepcionales como el que se ha establecido en castilla la mancha 33  otras propuestas como la participacin de los institutos de medicina legal y ciencias forenses imlcf en sistemas especficos de vigilancia de la mortalidad permitira conocer en tiempo real los fallecimientos y sus causas en circunstancias tan excepcionales como las vividas esta participacin se sustenta en la supervisin de los cmd-bed que realizan los mdicos forenses en funciones de mdicos del rc en algunos imlcf en espaa este cpmetido generalmente circunscrito a los grandes municipios podra ampliarse al control de los cmd-bed recibidos en todas las oficinas de rc de esa comunidad as los imlcf trasladaran diariamente la informacin de los cmd-bed a los servicios de salud pblica de cada comunidad esta participacin que se ha llevado a cabo de manera exitosa en castilla y len aportara un gran valor aadido a los circuitos de notificacin habituales desde el punto de vista prctico debemos poder contar con suficientes certificados de defuncin certificados a los que se tiene acceso en los com provinciales ante una situacin de pandemia y especialmente con medidas de confinamiento se deben prever mecanismos de remisin rpidos y sencillos entre los com y los servicios funerarios yo asistenciales como conclusin sealamos que la cumplimentacin del cmd-bed es un acto mdico trascendente que requiere una valoracin integral de la patobiografa del paciente y que ayuda a humanizar el trato a las familias en circunstancias de padecimiento emocional intensas se debe mejorar los mtodos de comunicacin de la mortalidad estableciendo la posibilidad de certificacin telemtica en circunstancias de epidemias y pandemias es necesario que se emitan recomendaciones claras sobre la certificacin por parte de organismos oficiales y establecer si no es posible la comunicacin telemtica circuitos ms giles que permitan conocer la mortalidad en tiempo real   expanding patient access to investigational new drugs gail van norman a   releasing investigational new drugs to individual patients who are facing certain death or disability seems to be a relatively uncomplicated decision but allowing ea to entire groups of patients for treatment with an investigational new drug presents more complex regulatory logistical and ethical challenges for scientists commercial entities and the fda the current regulatory process from ind filing to drug approval has evolved and includes not only the fdas historical primary mission of ensuring patient safety but also since the latter half of the 20th century the newer mission of ensuring that marketed drugs are actually efficacious for their advertisedapproved use ea for a single patient may not present much of a challenge to the assertion that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks because as presumably the patient requesting compassionate use faces an otherwise dismal clinical future taking even significant risks with a new drug still presents potential benefits to a patient without other options early in a drugs regulatory pathway however it is not usually possible to ensure that a drug has a reasonable riskbenefit ratio for all patients including those in the early stages of disease drug companies face bigger issues when the seeker of ea is a group of patients or an entire class of patients before marketing manufacture of the drug for clinical studies is nearly an all cost proposition for the commercial entity the drug cannot be marketed to cover its costs thus companies generally only manufacture sufficient quantities plus a small margin to cover the requirements of clinical studies rather than devote resources to manufacturing large quantities of a drug which has a 10 chance of ever making it to market 1 2 the fda approval process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug ind making the drug available to groups or classes of patients who might then deplete the supply of drug for clinical studies could compromise the very research that would more completely disclose a drugs risks and benefits thus it could possibly impede full market approval that would make the drug more widely available companies have also expressed concern about how data from such compassionate use may be applied in the approval process patients seeking ea are usually sicker and have more advanced disease and therefore are more likely to experience unfavorable outcomes of all types their experience does not necessarily apply to the entire patient population for which the drug is eventually targeted an excess number of adverse outcomes in a compassionate use group could compromise marketing approval after clinical studies are complete finally if the drug is made available to a large enough patient base prior to marketing approval then what patients would be willing to subject themselves to placebo-controlled trials in which they might not receive the active therapy patient recruitment for clinical studies could be compromised which could slow or even prevent the clinical trials process for full drug approval such concerns are not merely theoretical but have in fact caused significant controversy and potentially impeded the approval of some important medical treatments probably no drug better illustrates the pitfalls of compassionate use than ganciclovir the first compound discovered with activity against human cytomegalovirus cmv which can cause devastating disease in immunocompromised patients in 1984 syntex corporation later integrated into the roche group was engaged in animal studies of ganciclovir when a physician requested the drug under a compassionate use agreement with the fda to treat a young mother dying of cmv pneumonia 8 unfortunately the woman died despite treatment cmv infection was emerging as the cause of death in up to 30 of patients with aids attacking the retina lungs liver brain spinal cord and intestines and only a few weeks later another physician requested compassionate use of ganciclovir in a 41-year-old man with advanced aids who was going blind from cmv retinitis based on this second patients dramatic and quantifiable improvement syntex decided they had an ethical obligation to provide the drug when requested and developed a written protocol setting criteria of documented immunocompromise and cmv infection that was an immediate threat to life or sight 8 in 1986 a series of 26 patients who received the drug under compassionate use was published in the new england journal of medicine documenting the first effective treatment for cmv infection 9 later studies also showed that ganciclovir patients were living longer 10 the fda refused approval of ganciclovir for treatment of cmv retinitis because they had no animal studies for that use nor significant human placebo-controlled trials on which to base a marketing application many questioned whether the use of ganciclovir was wise or safe 11 12 but because of ganciclovirs known efficacy it became paradoxically impossible to carry out human controlled trials because such trials are only ethically justifiable if investigators are honestly uncertain about whether net positive benefits over placebo exists 13 furthermore neither patients nor doctors were willing to risk assignment to placebo and further loss of eyesight after the results were published syntex then sought approval to study ganciclovir for treatment of cmv colitis knowing that once marketing approval of the drug was obtained fda rules would allow off-label use for retinitis 14 physicians at the fda refused the ind filing due to insufficient animal studies on which to base use of ganciclovir in colitis eventually the fda and syntex developed a research protocol involving patients with less severe peripheral retinopathy but no patients would enroll an attempt was made to force patients to sign up by denying victims of early or less severe retinitis access to ganciclovir through compassionate use exemptions these actions were met by a severe public backlash doctors simply began declaring any patient with cmv retinitis as having a sight threatening condition while patients refused enrollment in the clinical trial aids advocates lobbied congress for improved access to investigational drugs and sit-ins began in protest ultimately the fda succumbed to public pressure and approved ganciclovir 5 years after its first in-human treatment use prior to ganciclovir the fda did have mechanisms by which they could approve the use of experimental drugs for individual patients however the struggle to approve ganciclovir and public advocacy during the aids epidemic had 2 critical effects on future drug approval processes 1 a large patient advocacy group demonstrated its ability to move government regulations toward early access and streamlined drug approval and 2 compassionate use was opened up for entire groups of patients rather than being restricted to individuals regulations have evolved over the last 35 years and now formalized pathways exist at the fda that permit ea to intermediate patient groups and entire patient classes within all inds there are 2 classifications research and commercial inds the fda defines a commercial ind as one in which either 1 the sponsor is a corporate entity or is 1 of the institutes of the national institutes of health or 2 if it is clear that the drug will eventually be commercialized the ind is defined as a research ind if the drug is sponsored by an individual within each class of ind commercial and research there are subcategories of inds of which the most common is the investigator indin which the investigator initiates and conducts the studies and provides the immediate supervision of the drugs use the fda allowed individual patient ea as far back as the 1970s but there were no specific pathways for such ea until the late 1980s and even those were only codified in 2009 ea pathways at the fda have undergone continual updates the most recent of which was published in october of 2017 14 at this time ea of nonapproved drugs for treatment of more than 1 patient at a time is achievable only through the fda in contrast with access for individual patients which technically can be legally obtained without the fda by applying to the manufacturer directly 6 as with individual ea inds specific conditions for group patient access apply 1 the patients must have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition with no comparable therapy or satisfactory alternative therapy 2 the potential benefit must justify the potential risks of the treatment and 3 providing the treatment must not compromise or interfere with the ongoing fda drug development program such as by critically depleting a limited supply of investigational drug that is also needed for an ongoing study or a future study that is in the planning stages 4 an immediately life-threatening condition or disease is defined by the fda as a stage of disease in which there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months or in which premature death is likely without early treatment a serious disease or condition is defined as being associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning furthermore while short-lived or self-limited morbidity will usually not be a sufficient qualifying condition the morbidity need not be irreversible provided it is persistent or recurrent the fda states that whether a condition is serious or not is a matter of clinical judgment based on its impact on such factors as survival day-to-day functioning or the likelihood that the disease if left untreated will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one 15 an intermediate-size treatment ind is intended to provide ea to more than 1 patient at time but generally to a smaller patient group than might for example be recruited for a clinical trial under an existing ind 15 a primary feature distinguishing an intermediate ea protocol from a clinical study under an existing ind is that an intermediate ea protocol is not primarily intended to obtain data or other information about a drugs safety or efficacy under an existing ind or protocol ea can only be provided if the drugs sponsor is already actively pursuing marketing approval of the drug for the same use for which ea is being requested however other circumstances do allow ea if an existing treatment ind is not in place ea can also occur 1 when a drug has been withdrawn due to safety concerns but there exists a patient group in which the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks 2 use of a similar unapproved drug eg foreign-approved drug is sought due to a shortage of the approved drug 3 use of an approved drug where availability is limited due to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems for diagnostic monitoring or treatment purposes but the use is sought by patients who cannot obtain the drug under such rems see the following section or 4 other reasons approved by the fda both intermediate- and widespread-treatment inds can each be obtained through 2 types of regulatory submissions to the fda 1 as an ea protocol submitted as an amendment to a protocol in an existing ind or 2 as a new ind submission that is separate and distinct from any existing ind and is intended only for the purpose of making a drug available for treatment use 15 when there is an existing ind the fda usually encourages submission of an ea protocol under the existing ind to keep all ea use and clinical trials consolidated this may simplify identification of safety issues decrease the administrative burden to investigators and the fda and eventually help the review of the drug for approval when there is no existing ind on a drug or if the sponsor under an existing ind declines to sponsor the proposed ea then a new treatment ind must be filed for intermediate-sized ea inds a major difference between submitting an ea protocol under an existing ind versus submitting a new separate ea ind is that treatment may begin much earlier under an ea protocol in an existing ind any new ea ind must go through all of the processes of any new ind with the obligatory 30-day waiting period after submission for treatment to begin but if the ea protocol is submitted under an existing ind there is no 30-day waiting period 15 for widespread treatment inds in contrast both ea protocols under an existing ind and new ea inds require a 30-day waiting period after submission for treatment to begin the story of thalidomide illustrates the advantages of granting humanitarian drug use with rems in place prior to its use in humans thalidomide had been determined to have an excellent safety profile due to extensive research in animals jl schardein observed that in approximately 10 strains of rats 15 strains of mice 11 breeds of rabbits 2 breeds of dogs 3 strains of hamsters 8 species of primates and other animal species such as cats armadillos guinea pigs swine and ferrets in which thalidomide had been tested teratogenic effects had been induced only occasionally 18 in fact when human birth defects began to appear in the offspring of women who had ingested thalidomide during pregnancy as a sedative and to treat nausea researchers pointed out that thalidomide had failed to demonstrate teratogenicity in rats and at first insisted that thalidomide could not be the culprit in germany where the drug was first developed thalidomide was held to be so safe that no prescription was required for its use it was advertised for use in pregnant women 19 and the drug company distributed free samples to its factory employees 18 19 indeed thalidomide was just 1 day away from automatic fda approval in the united states in september of 1960 when frances oldham kelseythe fdas first woman reviewer who was on her first assignment in the agency during her first month of employmentintervened over her concerns about the lack of rigorous scientific human studies 19 20 in dr kelseys words it just so happened that my first application was for the drug thalidomide i got this because i was new and they thought i should have an easy one to start on 19 because of dr kelseys quick action the united states largely escaped the tragedy of thalidomide in contrast to other western countriesonly 17 us cases of thalidomide-related birth defects were ever reported 18 globally the first known case of a thalidomide-induced birth defect occurred when a baby girl the daughter of an employee of the drug developer was born without ears in germany on christmas day of 1956 the number of infants born with thalidomide-related deformities worldwide grew to over 10000 cases 21 as a direct result of the thalidomide tragedy the us congress was galvanized in 1962 to pass the kefauver harris amendments to the 1938 food drug and cosmetics act to strengthen drug regulation in the united states 22 23 thalidomide was ultimately banned in 1962 and would never have been heard of again had it not been for a chance discovery in jerusalem in 1964 dr jacob sheskin was treating a patient with leprosy whose pain was so great the patient could not sleep he obtained permission to treat the patient with thalidomide and found that the drug treatment also caused regression of the leprosy with cautious support from the march of dimes one of the thalidomide victim advocacy groups the fda approved thalidomide for treatment of leprosy in 1998 24 25 until better drugs came along thalidomide became the drug of choice in treating erythema nodosum leprosum a complication of leprosy 21 in 1992 on a different front dr robert damato was looking for a drug to treat macular degeneration he discovered that thalidomide inhibited vascular proliferation and might be useful in this disorder 26 although its use in macular degeneration was not ultimately satisfactory the drug is now used to treat a number of other ailments tuberculosis multiple sclerosis crohns disease human immunodeficiency virus aids and multiple myeloma 19 20 22 the use of thalidomide is severely restricted in the united states by the fda with the original safety requirements then called the system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety steps program initiated in 1998 27 28 thalidomide was given the most severe rating for drugs that contribute to fetal deformities and for drugs whose risks outweigh possible benefits to patients the steps program requires registration by both prescribing physicians and their patients required proof of an initial negative pregnancy test prior to treatment of female patients proof that the patient was using 2 forms of contraception and submission of monthly pregnancy tests 27 male patients are encouraged to use condoms during sexual intercourse because it is unknown whether thalidomide in semen is teratogenic the steps program would later provide a framework for similar measures regarding isotretinoin a drug used to treat severe acne and also known to cause severe birth defects elsewhere in the world where the drug is not so well regulated thalidomide birth defects are still reported 19 steps and the measures taken with isotretinoin are the forerunners of the modern rems in the bioshield legislation of 2004 the us congress created a separate class of authorization for release of investigational drugs and biologics eg vaccines for use in entire civilian populations in a declared public health emergencythe emergency use authorization eua 29 30 examples of such emergencies include epidemic outbreaks bioterrorism attacks chemical spills and attacks and radiation and nuclear attacks eua is different from the emergency use of an investigational product under the ea program of the fda because an eua requires the declaration of a public health emergency by the secretary of health and human services the secretary of defense or the secretary of homeland security they can then request an eua to permit the use of unapproved investigational drugs or unapproved uses of approved medical products an fda workgroup then takes into account the availability safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic weighed against the communicability morbidity and mortality of the public health threat in deciding whether to release the treatment eua does not require documentation of individual informed consent although information about the product must be provided to health care providers and individual patients 31 the process for approval of an eua is summarized in figure 1
32 the first use of an eua was in 2005 allowing the us department of defense to provide anthrax vaccines to service members deployed in regions of the world subject to high threats for biological weapons other examples have included the use of diagnostic devices in the zika outbreak of 2016 a significant regulatory shortcoming of the eua is that it does not contain provisions to collect prospective outcome data during the use of the investigational drug or biologic and limited retrospective reports provide very limited information for answering safety and efficacy questions in a substantiated way euas also raise particular questions of what role if any investigational drugs should play in a communicable disease outbreak 33 communicable diseases often present urgent needs by patients because outbreaks are usually acute in nature with high transmissibility and potentially high community morbidity and mortality determining benefits and risks of an investigational drug or biologic in the setting of a public health crisis involves a certain amount of duress on investigators health care providers and patients with limited time for a considered decision thus euas may not be appropriate for drugs that are in very early-phase testing where reasonable riskbenefit ratios are almost entirely unknown and a potentially large number of subjects will be exposed to the drug with regard to benefits infectious disease emergencies also carry a unique consideration treatment of an index patient has potential to both benefit the individual but also the community at large by containing the outbreak conditions for which there are current euas in effect are listed in table 1
34 the ebola outbreak in west africa in 2014 to 2015 demonstrates some of the problems regarding release of investigational products on a population under duress over 1700 people were sickened and over 930 died the world health organization knew of several vaccines and biologics that were in the pipeline to treat the ebola virus but none had been subjected to human studies and the organization initially ruled out their use despite this 2 us citizens involved in epidemic response became ill with ebola and were treated with an experimental mixture of monoclonal antibodies called zmapp mapp biopharmaceutical inc and leafbio san diego california defyrus inc toronto ontario canada the us government and the public health agency of canada both patients survived 35 their treatment resurrected debate about the use of untested drugs in such dire circumstances the who convened a panel of ethicists to discuss whether treatments without prior in-human testing should be tried in circumstances where an epidemic had such a high fatality rate with only 2 test cases no scientific conclusions could be drawn about zmapps efficacy or safety 35 36 the published report of the who set out considerations for when unregistered drugs could be used to treat ebola and principles regarding prioritizing those who should receive treatment such as women and children 36 the fact that the treatment was made available to 2 us citizens and not to africans who comprised most of its victims engendered anger over the social justice of such decisions providing as enserink 35 points out a tragic validation to the satirical yet somewhat prophetic paper that had appeared in the onion only weeks before titled experts ebola vaccine at least 50 white people away 37 fda ea rules allow patient access to drugs that have had at least some in-human exposure the ganciclovir saga zmapp and other experiences raise the question of what to do when a potentially beneficial drug is needed that has not undergone any in-human testing and furthermore cannot undergo such human studies due to ethical concerns in 2015 the fda released a guidance for industry to address drugs developed to ameliorate or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions caused by exposure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic substances when human efficacy studies are not ethical and field trials are not feasible 38 under certain conditions the fda may accept animal studies in lieu of human clinical trials provided that there is reasonable expectation that the animal studies are predictive of in-human effects such conditions may apply not only to individual patient use but potentially to widespread use during a public health emergency and must meet specific requirements table 2 39 as of now 12 products have been approved under the animal rule 7 of which were issued quickly after the guidance was published table 3 40 approval via the animal rule is usually subject to several conditions 1 post-marketing field studies must verify and describe the products clinical efficacy and safety when such studies are ethical and feasible 2 restrictions may be imposed to ensure safe use only under the approved labelling ie off-label use may be forbidden and 3 information must be provided to patients prior to administration regarding the conditions of approval and directions for use contraindications foreseeable risks adverse reactions and drug interactions the fda provides guidance on product development under the animal rule including general expectations and qualified animal models under fda center for drug evaluation and research and center for biologics evaluation and research programs as well as study design considerations 38 the guidance was not in place during the 2014 to 2015 west african ebola virus outbreak at that time vaccines and drugs that were considered for use had not yet undergone human trials and the quantities of these agents were not sufficient at the start of the epidemic to support human use currently studies are underway of ebola survivors 41 42 ea inds in the united states usually involve individual patients rather than groups in contrast with individual patient ind applications which numbered between 322 and 1110 annually between 2010 and 2016 intermediate ea ind submissions ranged between 0 and 50 annually total  171 over the entire period and only 2 widespread treatment ind applications were filed during that same period fda refusals of ea inds are uncommon with a total of 10 intermediate ind refusals and zero widespread treatment ind refusals from 2010 through 2016 figure 2 supplemental figure 1 43 when multiple individual patients are seeking ea to a particular drug and meet criteria for ea the fda encourages all individual applications to be consolidated under a single intermediate-sized ind or ea protocol and that the commercial sponsor be the sponsor of the ea ind or ea protocol this is to avoid having multiple single-patient inds and multiple sponsors for a single investigational drug that being said regulations do not actually forbid authorizing more than 1 single- or intermediate-patient ind for the same drug if the drug is not being developed for commercial use and the sponsor seeking ea intends to treat more than 1 patient then the fda requires an intermediate-size ea ind or protocol if on the other hand the drug is being developed for marketing for ea use then a treatment ind or protocol not intermediate-size ind or protocol will be necessary if clinical development of the drug is essentially completethat is clinical trials have ended and the drug is awaiting marketing approvalregardless of the number of patients involved the fda generally requires a treatment ea ind or protocol rather than an intermediate-sized ea ind or protocol although there is no specific size limitation to intermediate-sized ea inds or protocols in general the fda intends intermediate-sized ea inds and protocols to serve populations that are smaller than those that would be included in clinical trials under a regular ind and for drugs that have not yet essentially completed clinical trials in some cases the fda will require transitioning of an intermediate-size ea ind or protocol to a treatment ea ind or protocol this can occur when clinical evidence supports a treatment ind or protocol when drug development has sufficiently progressed to warrant transition to a treatment ind or protocol and when the sponsor is willing to make the drug available for the ea use to a larger patient population under a treatment ind or protocol the fda anticipates that there would ordinarily be a seamless transition from intermediate-size patient population expanded access to expanded access under a treatment ind or protocol 15 although this requires close coordination with the fda review division overseeing the drugs development both intermediate and widespread treatment inds require the submission of an ea application which follows the same processes as an ind filing the submission can be in the form of a new ind or as a protocol amendment to an existing ind 4 as with regular inds commencement of treatment may begin within 30 days of fda receipt of the application if the fda does not object or place a clinical hold 1 or earlier if the fda notifies that early treatment can begin for patients with terminal or severe and debilitating illnesses who have few treatment options the wait for approval of investigational therapeutics may be too long and effective treatment may come too late to prevent severe debilitation or death the fda has long had mechanisms to approve compassionate use for individual patients but more recently has developed expanded access pathways for groups and entire classes of patients to access investigational treatments or if enrolled in a late-phase clinical trial to continue treatment with an investigational drug or biologic after clinical trials are concluded and the treatment awaits final fda approval in addition fda mechanisms allow emergency release of investigational drugs and biologics in a declared public health emergency the release of unapproved drugs for patient populations carries special risks larger patient populations may be exposed to drugs of unproven value with unknown risks in cases where human trials would be unethical such as in testing a treatment of a known life-threatening toxin harmful radiation exposure or other danger to health new guidance from the fda allows release of investigational agents that have not had any in-human trials under the animal rule  krisenmanagement bernhard tenckhoff silvester siegmann   das wort krise ist in unserem sprachgebrauch meistens negativ besetzt obwohl es auch

organisatorischen und abwehrenden brandschutz unterteilt die einzelnen manahmen des zu erstellenden brandschutzkonzeptes mssen dabei aufeinander abgestimmt sein so dass ein reibungsloses ineinandergreifen der manahmen gewhrleistet wird der vorbeugende brandschutz ist ein wichtiger bereich des baurechts da dieses in der bundesrepublik deutschland lndersache ist existieren sehr viele unterschiedliche landesbauordnungen die sich mehr oder weniger an einer musterbauordnung orientieren in nordrheinwestfalen z b sind gem der landesbauordnung bauo nrw vom 01032000 gv nw nr 18 s 256

die anforderungen an die struktur der flucht und rettungswege sowie der dazugehrigen plne ergeben sich aus der technischen regel fr arbeitssttten asr a23 fluchtwege und notausgnge flucht und rettungsplan vom 16 august 2007 in diese neue arbeitsstttenregel wurde auch die  empfehlung des bundesministers fr arbeit und sozialordnung zur aufstellung von flucht und rettungsplnen nach  55

nutzungseinheit mit mindestens einem aufenthaltsraum wie wohnungen praxen etc in jedem geschoss ber mindestens zwei voneinander unabhngige rettungswege ins freie vorhanden sein diese formulierung lsst die fehlinterpretation zu dass auch geschosse in denen sich keine aufenthaltsrume befinden zwei unabhngige rettungswege haben mssen dies ist hier aber nicht gemeint in der landesbauordnung nordrheinwestfalens ist diese formulierung gendert dort heit es fr jede nutzungseinheit mssen in jedem geschoss mit einem aufenthaltsraum zwei rettungswege vorhanden sein d h berall dort wo aufenthaltsrume vorhanden sind sind zwei voneinander unabhngige rettungswege notwendig die rettungswege sind so anzuordnen dass die maximal zulssigen entfernungen  nach der mbo maximal 35 m  zu tren die direkt ins freie fhren und zu treppenrumen notwendiger treppen nicht berschritten werden in den sonderbauvorschriften werden im vergleich zur mbo unterschiedliche maximal zulssige entfernungen genannt die rettungswege sind durch gut lesbare und dauerhafte beschilderung zu kennzeichnen rettungswege treppenrume und notwendige flure mssen brandlastfrei gehalten werden jedes nicht zu ebener

feuerwehr erreichbare stelle sein dies ist z b im fall eines hochhauses aufenthaltsebene hher als 22 m ber erdoberflche nicht mglich da die feuerwehren in der regel fr solche einstze nicht ausgestattet sind im hochhaus sind zwei bauliche rettungswege erforderlich in verkaufssttten sind ebenfalls zwei bauliche rettungswege notwendig da in der regel eine derartig hohe personenanzahl nicht mit rettungsgerten der feuerwehr gerettet werden kann insbesondere in sonderbauten mit einer vielzahl von personen ist in der regel ein zweiter baulicher rettungsweg erforderlich die rettung einer vielzahl von personen ber das rettungsgert der feuerwehr ist nicht in angemessener zeit mglich um die sich im gebude befindlichen personen in die lage zu versetzen sich schnell und sicher orientieren zu knnen mssen flucht und rettungsplne erstellt werden die eine mglichst einfache darstellung der baulichen gegebenheiten sowie eine unproblematische lesbarkeit aufweisen grundlage der flucht und rettungsplne ist die arbeitsstttenverordnung arbstttv auch wenn es derzeit nicht direkt gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist hat sich in der praxis die bestellung von brandschutzbeauftragten bewhrt der brandschutzbeauftragte sollte eine mehrjhrige praxis im vorbeugenden brandschutz besitzen undoder eine ausreichende ausbildung im vorbeugenden brandschutz haben vergleichbar den fachkrften fr arbeitssicherheit sollte der brandschutzbeauftragte unmittelbar der leitung des werkes oder betriebes unterstellt sein fr dessen brandschutz er zustndig ist zu allen den brandschutz betreffenden fragen des unternehmens  auch bei der planung  sollte er gehrt werden zu seinen aufgaben und pflichten gehrt das erkennen von gefahren sowie ihre beurteilung er hat dafr zu sorgen dass sie beseitigt und schden mglichst gering gehalten werden dem brandschutzbeauftragten sollten insbesondere folgende aufgaben bertragen werden
aufstellen der brandschutzordnung der alarm feuerwehreinsatz und ggf rumungsplne katastrophenplne zur besseren bersicht kann es zweckmig sein zustzlich detaillierte brandschutzplne zu

stndigen kontakt zur zustnden feuerwehr und fr gemeinsame bungen und betriebsbegehungen kein brand ohne schaden daher nach dem brand ist vor der sanierung einer der ersten schritte ist die unverzgliche meldung des schadenfalles an den zustndigen versicherer insbesondere bei brnden mit hherem gefahrenpotenzial kann dies entscheidenden einfluss auf die gesamte schadenabwicklung haben diese frhzeitige meldung des schadenfalles versetzt den versicherer in die lage rechtzeitig zu reagieren und dadurch u a sicherzustellen dass eine rasche und qualifizierte beurteilung der schadensituation vor ort durch den versicherer veranlasst werden kann abb 109 vor beginn der sanierungsarbeiten sind unterschiedliche bewertungen vorzunehmen und entscheidungen zu treffen in der regel hat der betroffene hierzu professionelle hilfe wie etwa durch den versicherer durch sachverstndige oder sanierungsunternehmen ntig nur mit dieser hilfe kann das unternehmen schnellstmglich wieder die produktion aufnehmen und den verlust von vertrauen und einen imageschaden verhindern letztendlich knnte dies auch zum verlust der kunden und somit der wirtschaftlichen grundlage fhren auf basis der erstbegehung durch die o a experten erfolgt die einteilung der brandstelle in die gefahrenbereiche notfallmanahmen und erste hilfe sind zentraler bestandteil der betriebsorganisation grundstzlich sollte der unternehmer bei der einrichtung von arbeitssttten besser noch bei der planung notfallmanahmen bercksichtigen um z b bei brnden und anderen gefhrlichen strungen im betrieb ein sofortiges verlassen des arbeitsplatzes zu ermglichen notfallmanahmen sind im  22 der bgv a1 geregelt zu den notfallmanahmen gehren u a die aufstellung eines alarmplanes eines flucht und rettungsplanes sowie einer brandschutzordnung im alarmplan wird festgelegt welche manahmen in notfllen wie brand unfall einbruch berfall durchgefhrt werden mssen und ist an geeigneten stellen im unternehmen auszuhngen wichtig ist dass der alarmplan regelmig im hinblick auf nderungen von telefonnummern und personalwechsel aktualisiert wird versicherte sollten ber inhalte und ablufe z b im rahmen einer unterweisung informiert werden der unternehmer hat dafr zu sorgen dass fr die erste hilfe und zur rettung aus der gefahr die erforderlichen einrichtungen und sachmittel zur verfgung stehen die  2428 der bgv a1 regeln die erste hilfe zu den einrichtungen und sachmitteln gehren insbesondere meldeeinrichtungen erstehilfematerial rettungsgerte transportmittel und sanittsrume das erforderliche personal umfasst in erster linie ersthelfer und betriebssanitter sowie versicherte die in der handhabung von rettungsgerten und rettungstransportmitteln unterwiesen sind auch kann der unternehmer zur sicherstellung der ersten hilfe personen mit einer hher qualifizierten ausbildung in erster hilfe benennen dazu gehren personen mit sanitts oder rettungsdienstlicher ausbildung oder berufe des gesundheitsdienstes wie z b krankenschwester krankenpfleger arzthelferarzthelferin etc  24 abs 3 bgv a1 verlangt vom unternehmer dass verletzte sachkundig transportiert werden oft ist es schwierig als laie verletzungen und erkrankungen bezglich der art des transportes einzuschtzen grundstzlich gilt bei der auswahl eines geeigneten transportmittels dass die auswahl im zweifel durch einen arztbetriebsarzt herbeigefhrt wird hufig ist kein arztbetriebsarzt wie z b auf baustellen vor ort so dass im zweifel die rettungsleitstelle zu informieren ist wird der transport durch den ffentlichen rettungsdienst vorgenommen so trifft dieser alle weiteren entscheidungen in betrieben sind durch berufsgenossenschaftliche aushnge oder in anderer geeigneter schriftlicher form hinweise u a ber die erste hilfe sowie angaben ber

 25 der bgv a1 hat der unternehmer meldeeinrichtungen vorzuhalten damit ein notruf unverzglich ohne schuldhaftes verzgern abgesetzt werden kann notfallsituationen erfordern unverzgliche hilfe da die

im zuge der globalisierung verstrken immer mehr unternehmen ihr auslandsgeschft die zahl der auslandseinstze der mitarbeiter nimmt stndig zu jedoch werden die risiken die damit verbunden sind hufig einfach ausgeblendet es wird zu oft leichtfertig mit dem hchsten gut eines unternehmens den mitarbeitern umgegangen obwohl die risiken stndig zunehmen unternehmen die mitarbeiter ins ausland entsenden mssen regionsabhngig stets mit naturereignissen wie erdbeben seuchen wie sars vogelgrippe oder denguefieber terror und kriminellen akten wie bombenanschlgen oder entfhrungen rechnen erstaunlich sei auch dass unternehmen sich hufig nur um das visum und die schutzimpfungen des entsendungspersonals kmmern nicht aber um eine umfassende sicherheitsvorsorge dabei umfasst ein gutes basisschutzpaket weitaus mehr aspekte die richtige personalauswahl vor der entsendung die arbeitsmedizinische vorsorgeuntersuchung incl reisemedizinischer beratung die einweisung in das jeweilige land und dessen landesspezifischen gefahren die untersttzung bei der unterkunftssuche die auswahl geeigneter kontaktpersonen vor ort und eine gesicherte ansprechbarkeit der unternehmens rund um die uhr mssen unbedingt bercksichtigt werden fr den ernstfall sind jedoch noch zu wenig unternehmen professionell vorbereitet sie verlassen sich offensichtlich nur auf die geschicke des auenministeriums durch eine pandemie wrde neben den unmittelbaren gesundheitlichen auswirkungen auf die bevlkerung auch die wirtschaft in mitleidenschaft gezogen werden zu den besonders betroffenen wirtschaftszweigen werden wahrscheinlich die tourismusindustrie die gastronomie die unterhaltungsindustrie konzerte groveranstaltungen das transportwesen und der gro und einzelhandel gehren es wird erwartet dass pharmazeutische unternehmen und hersteller von schutzausrstungen aufgrund der starken nachfrage in diesem sektor von einer pandemie zumindest wirtschaftlich profitieren werden alle branchen wren aber whrend des pandemiegipfels im eigenen land durch den ausfall an arbeitskrften eigene mitarbeiter zulieferer kooperationspartner betroffen schtzungen gehen bei einem schweren szenario wie 1918 von einem abfall des bruttoinlandsprodukts bip um 5  im pandemiejahr aus bei einem leichteren szenario wird mit einer reduktion des bip von 15  gerechnet nicht zu vernachlssigen sind auch die rein psychologischen auswirkungen in der bevlkerung als im frhjahr 2006 auf rgen ah5n1viren in toten wildvgeln gefunden wurden weckten und schrten entsprechende medienberichte ungerichtete ngste vor einer influenzapandemie die landwirtschaft und der tourismus waren die beiden branchen die diese befrchtungen am deutlichsten zu spren bekamen die bevlkerung und die wirtschaft mssen sich auf eine ber wochen bis monate andauernde ernste beeintrchtigung einstellen die wahrscheinlich smtliche bevlkerungsschichten betreffen wird wann eine solche bedrohung entstehen kann lsst sich nicht vorhersagen gerade deshalb ist jedes unternehmen aufgefordert in der zeitspanne davor eine mglichst weit reichende und effiziente vorbereitung fr den pandemiefall zu treffen da die zeit zwischen ausrufungfeststellung der pandemie und den auswirkungen eines solchen geschehens unter den heutigen umstnden der globalisierung flugverkehr u  auerordentlich schnell gehen kann nur wenn in der wirtschaft und in ffentlichen institutionen verantwortlichkeiten fr den ernstfall definiert informationsstrnge etabliert und notfallszenarios festgelegt sind lassen sich die folgen einer mglichen pandemie sowohl was die last in der bevlkerung durch krankheit und tod als auch die wirtschaftlichen folgen betrifft so gut wie mglich in grenzen halten in diesem szenario findet sich eine ausgeprgte schnittstelle zwischen krisenprvention und betrieblichem gesundheitsmanagement neben den gefahren bietet jede krise auch nutzbares chancenpotenzial  unternehmenskrisen mssen daher auch immer als chance zum neustart gesehen werden diese phase wird auch als recovery als neustart bezeichnet in dieser phase gilt es vor allem das vertrauen der kunden und der ffentlichkeit in das unternehmen zurck zu gewinnen eine unternehmenskrise muss aber auch intern gegenber den eignen fhrungskrften und mitarbeitern mental bewltigt werden je schneller diese phase erreicht wird desto weniger schaden erleidet ein unternehmen am beispiel des supply chain management wird deutlich dass im gesamten betrieblichen management nur ein umfassender ansatz erfolg verspricht auch alle zulieferer sind im krisenmanagement als teil des risikomanagements zu betrachten im rahmen des supply chain managements scm muss alles betrachtet werden was entweder in den betrieb reinkommt energie rohstoffe etc oder wieder raus muss produkte abfall etc kommt es nur in einem bereich zu logistischen problemen oder engpssen kann unter umstnden die ganze produktion still stehen ressourcen die fr die kritischen prozesse eines unternehmens erforderlich sind mssen auch im katastrophenfall zur verfgung stehen bekommt man das problem nicht schnell genug in den griff kann es zu einer krise fhren unternehmenskrisen wird es immer geben nicht jede unternehmenskrise ist vermeidbar jedoch gibt es systematische proaktive herangehensweisen die helfen warnsignale frhzeitig wahrzunehmen krisenpotenziale zu erkennen und zu antizipieren infrastrukturen aufzubauen ablufe einzuben und mitarbeiter zu schulen mit hilfe einer professionellen krisenprvention und bewltigung lassen sich sowohl die handlungsspielrume als auch die werte fr ein unternehmen langfristig erhalten krisenvorsorge sollte auch unabhngig von der unternehmensgre betrieben werden vorbereitete unternehmen bewltigen eine krise besser als unvorbereitete insgesamt hngt auch sehr viel von der qualitt der unternehmensfhrung und dem vorhandenen krisenbewusstsein eines unternehmens ab proaktive krisenvorsorge ist daher eine wertschpfende investition in die zukunft eines jeden unternehmens das undenkbare kann schon morgen in form einer krise realitt werden heutzutage kommt bei der krisenkommunikation fast kein unternehmen mehr um die einbeziehung des internets und um die sozialen medien herum das gilt auch fr behrden berufsgenossenschaften institutionen kommunen und organisationen insbesondere aktualitt anonymitt schnelligkeit und reichweite verleihen dem internet die doppelfunktion des feuerlschers und des brandbeschleunigers fluch oder segen in blogs chats und diskussionsforen knnen menschen ihre ngste informationen meinungen oder gerchte in windeseile verbreiten unternehmen die nicht in der lage sind darauf rechtzeitig zu reagieren knnen schnell ins hintertreffen geraten umgekehrt bietet das internet den unternehmen aber auch eine ideale informations dialog und beobachtungsplattform fr die eigene krisenkommunikation so dass fakten zeitnah eingestellt sowie gerchte oder falschmeldungen schnell wieder richtig gestellt werden knnen fr jedes unternehmen ist es daher von steigender bedeutung im rahmen seines issue management auch diese medien intensiv zu beobachten abb 1012 dieses instrument ist ein wichtiger teil des antizipativen krisenmanagements das issues management ist bereits seit den 1980er jahren in den usa ein wichtiges managementthema und findet seit ende der 1990er jahre im europischen raum ebenfalls anwendung diese bezeichnung issue entstammt dem angelschsischen sprachraum eine wrtliche bersetzung ins deutsche wre thema angelegenheit etc darunter versteht man in diesem zusammenhang insbesondere ein thema ffentlichen interesses mit hohem konfliktpotenzial issues management dient als frherkennungssystem fr schwache signale aus dem unternehmensumfeld durch das issues management hat ein unternehmen oder organisation also die mglichkeit schnell flexibel und vor allem sensibel auf jede nachricht und entwicklung zu reagieren die fr die identitt und wahrnehmung der unternehmensmarke wichtig ist und bei nichtbeachtung krisenpotenzial entwickeln kann das issue management lsst sich dabei in fnf phasen unterteilen

 table 1 shows examples of potential interventions to meet trainee well-being needs on the program institution and extra-institutional level the accreditation council for graduate medical education acgme requires access to food while on duty5 food service closures physical distancing and infection control measures time constraints and expense may limit trainee access to food provide information to trainees about community provided meals hospital-sponsored grocery stores and volunteer networks and advocate for meals for trainees on duty and gift cards for food delivery services the acgme recognized the importance of adequate rest to protect trainees and patients when it preserved the work hour requirements even for institutions granted stage 3 pandemic status6 monitor trainee access to adequate rest including call rooms and respite lodging trainees are exposed to and at risk of covid-19 illness and death7 screening and rapid access to covid-19 testing for trainees is critical to minimize infection to co-workers and patients high quality clinical care isolation policies and return to work criteria must be provided to trainees with covid-19 track trainee exposures testing and illness status communicate the need to leave work at the first signs of illness to minimize the risk to others and ensure adequate backup plans trainees are at greater risk of depression anxiety insomnia and distress during the covid-19 pandemic8 program leaders play a critical role in monitoring trainees and ensuring access to mental health services eg on-call telehealth mental health providers employee and family assistance programs stress and resilience town halls schedule debriefing of teams frequent check-ins and mindfulness activities to help support trainee mental health school and childcare closings have added to trainee stress provide trainees with information about state- and institution-supported childcare options consider flexible scheduling when possible eg a parenting or newborn elective concerns about adequate access to ppe are widespread and often exacerbated by conflicting policies and information9

10 program leaders and institutions must provide both adequate ppe and training6 and be notified of any deviations applying high reliability principles to infection control on an institutional level are critical accommodating high-risk individuals is important but challenging because criteria outlined by the centers for disease control and prevention or institution may not be clear while pregnancy has not been listed as a risk factor many program leaders are hesitant to expose their pregnant trainees to covid-19 patients responses can vary between total removal from face-to-face clinical care to transfer to lower risk environments eg newborn intensive care unit and may be mandatory or voluntary the risk of infection that trainees pose to their loved ones and families is an important concern9 ensure trainees have access to information about short- and long-term housing for health care workers who have been exposed to or are ill with covid-19 disinfection protocols showering facilities and extra scrubs financial stress on trainees may be compounded by worries about compensation if they fall ill additional childcare and other expenses spouses loss of income or post-graduate positions falling through be sensitive to financial stressors and provide guidance and resources shifting schedules including uncertainty about covering adult patients challenges trainees sense of safety provide when possible short-and long-term schedules including vacations and staffing for covid-19 surges in this regard chief residents have played a critical and often heroic role during this pandemic institutions departments and programs have adopted virtual technology email updates and websites to connect program leaders have developed web-based group-based learning activities town halls and meetings social activities such as games competitions and happy hours and journaling as ways to enhance connection consider creative ways to create a community for incoming interns in the face of physical distancing engagement with family and friends is important for trainee wellness11

12 assess this factor as part of trainee check-ins consider making video-communications eg zoom cisco webex more available to trainees to help them connect with families and friends physicians are being recognized world-wide for their dedication and sacrifices however those who have not cared for many covid-19 patients may not feel they have earned recognition be deliberate about incorporating shout-outs expressions of gratitude and tokens like gift certificates for trainees and advocate for extra compensation and other recognition from hospitals or departments encourage expressions of gratitude by trainees to help support well-being recognizing accomplishments of graduating trainees is challenging but consider personalized gifts and ceremonies that are virtual comply with physical distancing or that are rescheduled when rules are relaxed being sidelined can impact personal and professional identities of trainees which can be mitigated by engaging trainees in alternative meaningful activities eg clinical advocacy scholarship for those caring for adult patients adequate supervision and training are key in supporting self-efficacy collaborate with program leaders in internal medicine combined medicine-pediatrics and family medicine to optimize trainee learning climate training and scripts can help support trainees in communicating with adult patients and their families maslow defines self-actualization as the desire for self-fulfillmentto become everything that one is capable of becoming2 the pandemic challenged traditional modes of education but also offered opportunity to innovate both acgme and american board of pediatrics abp responded by waiving some curricular requirements especially for graduating trainees however program leaders are still responsible to ensure proficiency despite abbreviated training trainees have lost opportunities to network locally and nationally and participate in experiences that might be formative for their career choices association of pediatric program directors appd and council of pediatric subspecialties cops provide networking opportunities in addition consider developing virtual career mentoring and creating additional opportunities for trainees ensure adequate mentorship and help trainees build their curriculum vitae eg including abstracts accepted but not presented at national meetings development of new curricula to address changing educational and healthcare landscapes eg distance learning and mentoring telehealth have the potential to positively transform trainee experience kotters 8 step change management framework can offer guidance on how to effectively lead change during the covid-19 pandemic establish a sense of urgency form a powerful guiding coalition create a vision communicate the vision empower others to act on the vision plan for and create short-term wins consolidate improvement and produce more change and institutionalize new approaches table 2
4 while kotter presents his steps as linear many steps can be iteratively modified the covid-19 pandemic upends traditional medical education creating challenges to direct in-person patient care supervision and education clarifying the importance and immensity of these challenges to all stakeholders both educators and learners is an important first step a swot strengths weaknesses opportunities threats analysis may help establish a sense of urgency and identify next steps in addition to program leadership decide which additional stakeholders should be included consider including both those making larger clinical chair and educational decisions designated institutional official vice chair of education front-line faculty and trainees and individuals with technical expertise eg in information technology and telemedicine make it clear to members of the guiding coalition the role they will have in the transformation effort whether to brainstorm suggestions develop policies convince others andor model or enact changes create a shared vision to direct the educational change effort by prioritizing multiple potentially conflicting goals such as keeping trainees safe delivering excellent patient care and educating our next generation of pediatricians delineate strategies such as leveraging telemedicine and tele-education in order to meet set goals communicate frequently and regularly utilizing multiple communication modalities consider consolidating information from multiple sources into a central on line site and tailoring information to the audience to avoid information overload acknowledge that plans will change as situations change consider how to communicate changing information including being transparent about why changes were made to help stakeholders understand and accept changes many individuals and institutions recognize the unprecedented disruption in trainees lives from covid-19 and want to help provide them with a clear vision and plan for how they could intervene to improve trainee well-being and education if your vision and strategy include expanding telemedicine and tele-education opportunities empower faculty to innovate to engage learners remotely consider ways to minimize obstacles to change such as providing faculty development in telemedicine and how to actively engage an audience using tele-education empower faculty to experiment and creatively engage learners reiterate that mistakes pave the road to success empower your guiding coalition to experiment and model the way for others for example consider scheduling faculty who are most willing to experiment with novel tele-education modalities to lead resident didactics initially work one-on-one with faculty to ensure success delivering interactive educational conferences utilizing audience-response or virtual small group sessions recognize faculty who effectively utilize novel ways to engage learners with tele-education build on momentum created with short-term wins to create further change consider sharing best practices of how your faculty have engaged with learners remotely advocate within your institution for changes which could broadly improve the lives of local trainees such as extra money on meal cards child care assistance a larger temporary physician workspace to allow for physical distancing or temporary housing advocate within national organizations such as appd and cops for flexibility for programs and trainees to meet acgme abp and liaison committee on medical education requirements in light of disruption of education due to covid-19 articulate the relationship between new behaviors and success for example consider sharing feedback with all faculty about positive learner responses to specific techniques used to engage learners in distance learning consider building plans for succession by developing new leaders such as developing faculty champions for tele-education or telemedicine using a framework such as maslows hierarchy allows program leaders to systematically address trainees needs during and post covid-19 using kotters framework for leading change allows program leaders to effectively implement changes required to meet trainees needs additionally program leaders can take this opportunity to pause and re-evaluate what is essential during training and how we can continue to improve our education it is possible that we find that some of the systems of education we develop during the covid-19 pandemic such as telehealth tele-education and ways to stay connected during this era of required physical distancing may be important to continue and expand upon post-covid19  insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus induced in transgenic mice by ectopic expression of class ii mhc and interferon-gamma nora sarvetnick denny liggitt sharon pitts l stanley hansen e timothy stewartapos a   insulin-dependent type i diabetes mellitus iddm is a metabolic disorder resulting from the lack of endogenous insulin secretion this is due to a disease process caused by the disappearance of the insulin-producing f3 cells from the pancreatic islets of langerhans reviewed by gepts and lecompte 1985  human iddm and laboratory animal experimental diabetes mellitus are thought to be the result of both genetic and epigenetic components the genetic component consists of at least one gene in the major histocompatability complex mhc that contributes to susceptibility to the disease for the disease to develop some epigenetictriggering event must also occur experimentally this triggering event can be mimicked by either pharmacologic or infectious agents including several viruses the pharmacologic agents are thought to be toxic to the 8 cells whereas the pathway of disease induction by the viral agents is unknown evidence has been mounting that iddm has an autoimmune pathogenesis reviewed by rossini et al 1985 eisenbarth 1988  mhc class ii molecules normally expressed on the surface of b lymphocytes macrophages and dendritic cells play a central role in the immune response by presenting antigen to t helper tn cells the presence of the class ii molecules may be sufficient for antigen presentation in vitro fibroblasts transfected with the appropriate class ii genes and lipid bilayers incorporating purified class ii molecules can present antigen and activate appropriate t cell responses malissen et al 1984 norcross et al 1984 watts et al 1984 walden et al 1985  whether the class ii molecules are sufficient for th activation in vivo has not been resolved unanue 1984  the class ii genes lie within the i-a and i-e subregions of the h-21 region in mice and within the hla-d region in man and encode heterodimeric molecules composed of a 34 kd a chain and a 28 kd 6 chain the ectopic expression of class ii mhc molecules on nonimmune cell types has been documented in a variety of autoimmune states reviewed by pujol-borrell et al 1986b  class ii mhc molecules have been found on pancreatic 8 cells taken from newly diagnosed patients with iddm bottazzo et al 1985 foulis and farquharson 1986 foulis et al 1987  while the significance of this is unknown it has been speculated that the class ii expression could cause presentation of self antigens resulting in immune mediated destruction of the tissue although the cause of the aberrant class ii expression is not known it is noteworthy that the lymphokine interferon gamma ifn-i can induce class ii expression on a wide variety of cell types in vitro reviewed by rosa and fellous 1984  however it is unclear whether ifn-y alone can induce class ii expression on p cells of cultured islets campbell et al 1985 campbell et al 1986 pujocborrell et al 1986a wright et al 1986 pujol-borrell et al 1987  ifn- is produced by the host in response to viral and bacterial infections as opposed to the other interferons ifn-r is apparently a product only of t lymphocytes and natural killer nk cells possesses unique immunomodulatory properties and can also affect nonlymphoid tissues an intriguing potential pathway for autoimmune endocrine disorders has recently been proposed bottazzo et al 1983  briefly local viral infection or other environmental factors would lead the activation of t cells and subsequent local production of ifn-y the ifn-y may then induce the expression of class ii mhc molecules not only on normal antigen-presenting cells but also on local epithelial cells such as the pancreatic 8 cells such expression could cause the p cell to act as an antigen-presenting cell which may then present autoantigens to the host immune system and initiate an autoimmune response we sought to examine the relevance of these concepts by determining whether the expression of ifn-y or class ii mhc molecules by the pancreatic 8 cells in a laboratory animal would lead to iddm to investigate these questions we derived novel transgenic mouse lines designed to direct pancreatic 8 cells to express class ii mhc molecules or ifn-r in both cases a clinical diabetic state was produced of transgenic animals in order to derive transgenic mice expressing class ii mhc molecules or ifn- in the pancreatic 8 cells we constructed recombinant dna plasmids that joined the potential controlling sequences of the human insulin gene to the plasmids consist of coding region from the az a or ifn-y genes fused with the 5 flanking region of the human insulin gene the sequences from the human insulin gene include the entire first noncoding exon followed by the first intron and 15 bp of the second exon extending to one base before the initiator atg codon of the insulin gene see plnspro in pln-sproaa the terminator portion of the construct is contributed by the 3 untranslated region noncoding from the ai gene in the plnsproab construct the introcytoplasmic and 3 untranslated region are again contributed by fusion with the a sequences this substitution does not affect the a amino acid sequence since the two haplotypes are identical in this region the plnsprolfn-y construct includes terminator sequences from the hepatitis virus b gene the mouse class ii mhc a and ag genes and to the mouse ifn-y gene  figure 1  to maximize the potential for tissue-specific expression a relatively large upstream portion 1867 bp of 5 sequences of the human insulin gene promoter was used it has previously been shown in transgenic mice that 660 bp of 5 sequences of the rat insulin ii gene was sufficient to direct tissue-specific expression of a transgene hanahan 1985  the complete human insulin gene similarly leads to tissue-specific expression in transgenic mice bucchini et al 1986 selden et al 1986  the human insulin transcription start site and the complete untranslated first exon and part of the second exon of the human insulin gene were included in the construction this promoter cassette ends immediately prior to the insulin translation start site and was fused to the mouse genes in regions after their normal transcription start sites but before translation initiation since t cells must recognize foreign antigen in association with self class ii molecules the class ii genes used to make the fusion genes were from the same mouse strain as the zygotes used to make the transgenic mice thus the class ii genes were az and a and the zygotes were balbc h-2d for the microinjection to create transgenic animals linearized dna molecules separated from plasmid sequences were injected into mouse zygotes the in-sulin-a and insulinae chimeric genes were injected separately into inbred balblc zygotes in the insulin-a experiment 528 zygotes were implanted into pseudopregnant females of the 50 mice born 4 proved to be transgenie when analyzed by southern hybridization and the transgene copy numbers were estimated by comparison to the endogenous gene 443-11 3-5 copies per haploid complement 449-2 3-5 copies 451-l 3 copies and 443-5 10 copies in the insulin-ab experiment implantation of 409 zygotes yielded 63 mice 2 of which proved to be transgenic 474-13 s-lo copies and 466-5 20 copies for the insulin-ifn-y experiment a total of 254 zygotes of varying genotype were implanted into pseudopregnant females sixty-three mice were born and their dna analyzed by southern hybridization three mice proved to be transgenic two of which were cd-l x balbc fl hybrids 461-2 3-5 copies and 462-4 3-5 copies the other was derived from a cd-l x cd-l cross 454-4 10 copies all three have been backcrossed to inbred balblc mice and have subsequently segregated their transgene to a fraction of their progeny analysis of the insulin class ii transgenic animals none of the founder transgenic insulin-a or insulin-aa mice exhibited obvious phenotypic differences from controls however when founder a 443-11 and ab 474-13 females are indicated by circles males by squares and animals where sex was not determined by triangles solid black shading denotes the animals that carry the ab gene gray shading denotes animals that carry the a gene a dot indicates animals that were not analyzed the second generation animals l-7 were sacrificed 16 days after birth for pancreatic rna analysis and not analyzed by blood or urine glucose for diabetes mellitus mice were crossed some of the offspring at approximately 8 weeks of age appeared inactive had a huddled posture distended abdomens polydipsea and polyuria dipstick chemstrip boehringer mannheim testing of urine from these mice revealed glycosuria 2-50o glucose and hyperglycemia greater than 400 mgdl usually 600-1000 mgdl a subcutaneous insulin regimen o-4 unitsday ultra-lente insulin lilly was begun to control the clinically apparent diabetes mellitus based on minimizing the glycosuria and the animals health improved in approximately 2 weeks prior to insulin treatment blood glucose levels of the diabetic mice remained above 400 mgdl up to 1000 mgdl with insulin treatment blood glucose levels were approximately 150-350 mgdl similar results have been obtained mating founder a 449-2 with ab 474-13 mice this phenotype segregated only with the in-b a -l dp heritance of both the insulin-a and the insulin-ab transgenes  figure 2  pancreatic rna was extracted from mice carrying neither transgene the insulin-a transgene the insulin-ad transgene or both transgenes when these rnas were analyzed by northern blotting with a probe specific for the transgenes it was evident that both the a and as transgenes were expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the transgenic animals in animals with both transgenes both transcripts were seen  figure 3  in all other tissues analyzed no expression could be detected data not shown to demonstrate that mrna derived from the transgenes was translated and to further localize the tissue specificity of expression cryostat sections of young 1 month diabetic and control pancreata were examined after treatment with a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a mouse b -s-p diabetic mouse when compared to a typical normal islet a cells within islets shown inb c and d are less uniform in size type number and distribution islets from older diabetic mice are subjectively smaller mononuclear inflammatory cells such as those in d arrows are occasionally present b insulin antigen expression in a normal balm mouse and in an insulin-ajab transgenic diabetic mouse was assessed using the avidinbiotin immunoperoxidase method with dab as achromogen e darkly staining islet of langerhans from a normal balbc mouse f faintly staining islet from an insulin-ajag 6 week old diabetic mouse the diabetic mice revealed them to be composed of a morphologically heterogeneous group of cells clearly contrasting with the homogeneous cells forming islets of agematched controls see figures 5a-5d  cells in islets from 6 week or 2 month old transgenic mice were typically degranulated had pleomorphic nuclei that stained with variable intensity and were unevenly distributed  figures  5c and 5d  changes were less pronounced in younger mice figure 5b  there was generally an increased number of nuclei within affected islets some of which may represent nuclei of collapsed 6 cells or infiltrating inflammatory cells necrotic debris and mononuclear inflammatory cells were infrequently present in islets from 6 and 8 week old transgenic mice figures 5c and 5d  immunoperoxidase studies using antibodies to human insulin demonstrated reduced staining of the islet cells in diabetic transgenie mice in 2 month old diabetic mice the intensity of staining was dramatically reduced in comparison with controls and the percentage of faintly staining cells within various islets ranges from less than 10 to approximately 50 compared with islets from age-matched controls in which greater than 80 of the islet cells stain intensely for insulin antigen figures 5e and 5f  similar results were obtained when aldehyde fuchsin stain was used to demonstrate 6 cells quantitative morphometrics were not performed in this study however examination of step-sectioned pancreases from 1 or 2 month old diabetic mice revealed islets clearly smaller and less numerous than those in controls transgenic animals one of the three founder insulin ifny transgenic animals 461-2 appeared inactive at 10 weeks of age and abdominal distention polydipsea and polyuria were noted the mouse had glycosuria 20o-5 and the serum was lipemic a subcutaneous insulin regimen similar to that used for the diabetic transgenic insulin-a ap transgenic mice was begun and the animals health improved this animal transmitted its transgene to approximately 25 2076 of its offspring all of the transgenic offspring developed glycosuria 20o-5 and hyperglycemia greater than 400 mgdl up to 1000 mgdl beginning at approximately 6 to 10 weeks of age the second transgenic founder 462-4 never suffered from glycosuria and blood glucose measurement did not exceed 260 mgdl at 5 months of age it died of unknown causes and no further analysis could be performed this animal transmitted its transgene to approximately 30 of its offspring and 5 of the 14 transgenie offspring developed glycosuria and hyperglycemia to the same degree as the 461-2 line by approximately 20 weeks of age the third transgenic animal 454-4 has not shown glycosuria or hyperglycemia in its 8 months of life this animal transmitted its transgene to approximately 50 of its offspring and these have not developed either glycosuria or hyperglycemia all of the diabetic offspring have been treated with insulin regimens with resultant improved health pancreata from diabetic transgenic mice harboring the ifn-y gene were characterized histologically by variable accumulations of inflammatory cells within the parenchyma these cells were predominantly lymphocytes and macrophages although plasma cells and neutrophils were occasionally recognized pancreatic lesions tended to be less severe in younger mice and progress with age lesions in mildly affected generally neonatal mice consisted of interstitial edema accompanied by small clusters of lymphocytes between acini surrounding islets and small vessels  figure sa  in more severely affected mice there is substantial obliteration of islet as well as acinar structures by lymphocytic and histiocytic accumulations figures 6b and 6  primary insulitis inflammation confined to the islets was not an obvious feature in these mice however interstitial inflammatory cells commonly surrounded and infiltrated islets pancreata from older diabetic mice sustained on exogenous insulin had focally extensive areas of fibrosis interspersed with clusters of inflammatory cells figure 6d  lmmunoperoxidase studies of inflamed pancreata demonstrated a marked reduction in numbers and staining intensity of islet cells labeled with antibody to human insulin figures 6e and 6f  immunoperoxidase studies utilizing a monoclonal antibody against i-a antigens bhattacharya et al 1981 davignon et al 1981 revealed diffuse light to moderate staining of acinar tissue islets and epithelial cells lining the ducts data not shown we studied transgenic mice harboring fusion genes between the human insulin 5 regulatory region and the ifn-y gene and class ii mhc genes the two diseases produced in the transgenic mice are pathologically distinct in the doubly transgenic mice expressing both aa and a8 class ii sequences the pancreatic 8 cells largely disappear from the islets of langerhans by the time the animals are 2 months old this loss of cells is specific to the islets and does not notably affect the acinar tissue of the pancreas in older transgenic diabetic mice the islets resemble the pseudoatrophic islets seen in human iddm overt diabetes in these mice at least up to 3 months of age only occurs in those transgenic mice that have inherited a copy of each of the ins-a and ins-ab genes the conclusion is that the diabetes is caused by and is dependent on the expression of both these genes we have shown that the pancreata of the ins-a and ins-a0 transgenic mice contain mrna molecules derived from the transgenes we have also directly demonstrated the presence of class ii molecules within the islets of langerhans of the doubly transgenic mice it is possible that just the expression of the class ii molecules in the doubly heterozygous class ii mice could be deleterious to the f3 cells causing their eventual demise injury of cells due to expression of class ii molecules has never been reported in transfection experiments reviewed by germain and malissen 1986 or in the induction of class ii expression in 6 cells in vitro wright et al 1986 pujol-borell et al 1987  transgenic mice in which the pancreatic 8 however we have noticed an intermittent mild hyperglycemia in some of the a transgenic singly heterozygous mice from the 443-11 line with blood glucose values averaging approximately 180-200 mgldl in comparison with as transgenie mice or control mice which were 120-150 mgdl data not shown we cannot account for this at present it may be pertinent that in a line of transgenic mice carrying a class ii mhc e transgene abnormal constitutive expression of the endogenous es gene was observed yamamura et al 1985  a similar phenomenon might apply here and further investigation of this line should eluci-date the cause of the hyperglycemia it is also possible that the expression of class ii molecules affects the insulin producing function of the 6 cells without killing them resulting in diabetes loss of differentiation in 8 cells without cell death has been observed in virally initiated diabetes tishon and oldstone 1987  our results also indicate the possibility that the 8 cells could present antigen to th cells thus initiating an autoimmune reaction new immunological responsiveness has been demonstrated in transgenic mice through the introduction of an i-e gene le meur et al 1985 pinkert et al 1985 yamamura et al 1985  activation of an autoimmune response by presentation of presumably self antigens by the 6 cells implies a failure in self recognition tolerance nonresponsiveness to self antigens is thought to involve the deletion or suppression of clones of t cells that recognize self antigens it is possible that t cell clones reactive to components of nonimmune cells are not suppressed or deleted since these molecules are not normally seen by the host immune system thus in non-immune cells the expression of class ii molecules may lead to the presentation of self antigens to which the host immune system is naive resulting in the activation of an autoimmune response alternatively the extreme overexpression of class ii molecules in the 8 cells of these mice might lead to the bypass of tolerance by adventitious antigen presentation since in transfected fibroblasts the level of class ii expression is correlated with antigen presenting capacity lechler et al 1985  the data presented in this communication do not directly address the question of whether the 8 cell destruction in the ins-ia transgenic mice is a consequence of an autoimmune response experiments in progress examining the response to pancreatic grafts in these ins-ia mice and characterizing mice with mhc class i and an irrelevant protein inserted into the 8 cell membrane will begin to address this question the possibility also exists that antigen being presented by 8 cells is a foreign antigen derived from a virus see suzumura et al 1986  an extensive search for serological evidence by viral infection in diabetic and nondiabetic mice did not reveal the presence of antibodies against any virus known to be associated with diabetes although antibodies against mouse hepatitis virus were detected in both diabetic and nondiabetic mice relevant to this work are studies involving patients with autoimmune thyroid disorders thyroid follicular cells from such patients have been shown to aberrantly express class ii mhc molecules hanafusa et al 1983  these cells have the capacity to present foreign antigen to t cells in vitro londei et al 1984  in addition infiltrating t cells autoreactive to host thyroid cells have been isolated and cloned from diseased thyroid glands londei et al 1985  the diabetes in the arad transgenic mice could occur as a result of analogous processes however the apparent paucity of inflammatory cells in the islets is curious in human iddm although insulitis is thought likely to be present frequently during the initial stages of the disease it is often not detected perhaps because of its transient and nonuniform nature gepts and lecompte 1985  examination of younger prediabetic mice specific cell labeling studies and electron microscopic analysis will help define the mechanism of 8 cell destruction the few scattered inflammatory cells observed within the islets of these mice could be producing factors that are directly or indirectly toxic to 8 cells recent studies have suggested exquisite sensitivity of 8 cells to oxygen free radicals that are induced by lymphokines nomikos et al 1986 tsumimoto et al 1986 prowse et al 1986  the sparse amount of islet inflammation present in the current study may be sufficient to kill the 8 cells in these islets in this manner in the ifn-y model the 8 cells also disappear from the transgenic pancreas however in this case it is concomitant with a progressive inflammatory process that appears to be focused on the islets but involves the entire pancreas the active inflammatory lesion in younger mice consists primarily of chronic inflammatory cells of the type seen in response to viral infections and in autoimmune diseases interestingly the pathology is also reminiscent of that seen in transplant graft rejection of the acute cellu-lar type robbins et al 1984  the mechanism by which the inflammation is initiated however is unknown in diabetic mice the ifn-y could bedirectly inducing the expression of class ii molecules that would present self antigens to the host immune system as described above for the aa transgenic mice if ifn-r were acting solely by inducing the expression of class ii molecules then we might expect the histology of the ifn-y transgenic diabetic mice to resemble that of the ajab transgenic diabetic mice as this is clearly not the case the ifn-y must be participating in other cellular processes as well interferon-y is known to induce increased pancreatic class i mhc molecule expression in vitro campbell et al 1985 campbell et al 1986 pujol-borrell et al 1986a  increase class i mhc expression is seen in the islets of newly diagnosed diabetics bottazzo et al 1985 foulis et al 1987  one component of 8 cell destruction may involve cytotoxic t lymphocytes that recognize class i mhc molecules in conjunction with antigen additionally because of the large inflammatory infiltrate other lymphokines may be produced and contribute to the pathology leukocytes secrete tumor necrosis factor which acts as a chemoattractant for polymorphonuclear neutrophils figari et al 1987  interleukin-1 has been implicated in vitro as a causative factor in 8 cell damage bendtzen et al 1986  and the related proteins tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin have been shown to synergize with ifn-y in vitro to cause class ii expression by 8 cells pujol-borrell et al 1987  the ifn-y transgenic mice demonstrate the deleterious cascade of effects that are initiated by local production of ifn-y in vivo and may therefore provide an animal model for study of virus-caused interferon-mediated inflammation the incomplete penetrance of the diabetic phenotype in the 462-4 derived transgenic progeny is not readily understandable since these progeny are the second backcross of the cd1 outbred line to balbc there will be much genetic nonequivalence between these progeny it is possible that the variability in genetic background contributes to the penetrance of the transgene it has recently been reported that in both the nonobese diabetic nod mouse model and in human iddm an amino acid residue change specifically the absence of aspartic acid at residue 57 in the mouse i-ap or its human correlate hla-dqp chain is highly correlated with the propensity to develop iddm acha-orbea and mcdevitt 1987 todd et al 1987  the introduced a chain and the recipient balbc mice in the present experiment are of the same haplotype h-2d and contain aspartic acid at residue 57 of a0 choi et al 1983 malissen et al 1983  thus the allelic amino acid difference while clearly significant may not be necessary for the development of diabetes human iddm represents a heterogeneous group of disease syndromes with a common final pathologic expression diverse mechanisms likely play a role in the development of iddm these experiments were designed to bypass the initiating insult in addition to the genetic predisposition to the disease thereby separating and isolating several individual steps in a proposed pathway for autoimmune reaction generation to do so identifiable genetic perturbations were made which led to diabetes localized class ii mhc expression causes a depletion of p cells whereas ifn-7 which may lead to aberrant class ii expression causes cell depletion associated with an inflammatory disease process neither created a pathological phenocopy of what is thought to be the general progression of disease in human iddm although each recapitulated parts of the damage noted studies with transgenic mice may lead to a deciphering of the mechanisms of autoimmune disease the respective roles of adventitious class ii mhc expression selfantigen presentation lack of tolerance to self-antigens and local production of lymphokines can now be assessed in vivo plasmid containing an insulin promoter cassette was made by isolating in two steps a 19 kb earnhi-ncol fragment from the human insulin b allele gene ullrich et al 1980 ullrich et al 1982  blunt-ending the ncol site with sl nuclease and inserting it into a bamhi-hincll cleaved pucll8 vector to yield plnspro in the remaining constructions all restriction enzyme cleavage sites utilized for cloning were made blunt-ended with the klenow fragment of dna polymerase i except where noted to derive plnspro aa plnspro was cleaved at its unique sphl site and a 7 kb bamhl fragment containing the a coding sequence fused to the 3 untranslated region to the agk 3 sequences kindly provided by dr e choi university of cincinnati unpublished data was inserted at this site plnsproap was derived by cleaving a recombinant plasmid kindly provided by dr e choi unpublished data containing the a5 untranslated and coding region fused in the intracytoplasmic domain with the ai 3sequences with ecorl and isolated a 54 kb restriction fragment containing the majority of the gene the amino acid sequence of the a and the a proteins are identical in the cytoplasmic region thus the presence of these sequences in our construct does not alter the syngeneic nature of this experiment in order to remove 5 atg potential start codons this restriction fragment was treated for varying amounts of time with bal31 nuclease and inserted into a hincli cleaved pucl18 plasmid without klenow treatment restriction and sequence analysis was performed on recombinant clones and a clone containing 48 bp of sequence 5to the atg translation initiator of the a0 protein sequence was chosen this plasmid was cleaved at its unique xbal site and the bamhi-sphl insulin promoter fragment inserted this was cleaved with xhol and sphl and the large restriction fragment containing the plasmid and 5 sequences was ligated without klenow treatment to the 29 kb xhol-sphl restriction fragment containing 3sequences from the original a0 plasmid to derive plnsprolfn-y a recombinant plasmid containing the genomic murine ifn-y gene gray and goeddel 1983 fused with the hepatitis b 3 untranslated sequence kpn-sstll was cleaved with pvull to remove 5 sequences and the bamhi-sphl insulin promoter fragment from plnspro was inserted in their place of transgenic mice restriction fragments of the above plasmids free of plasmid sequences were isolated from low melting temperature agarose gels by nal-glass bead extraction geneclean 810101 dna was further purified free of contaminants by ultracentrifugation four week old balbc or cd-l outbred closed stock female mice were superovulated by injecting intraperitoneally ip 5 u of gonadotropin from pregnant mare serum 48 hr prior to injecting 5 u of human chorionic gonadotropin female mice were then mated with balbc or cd-1 proven breeder male mice the next day one-cell stage embryos were flushed from the oviducts of the mated female mice with m3 medium quinn et al 1982  the eggs were freed of cumulus cells and zona pellucida by hyaluronidase treatment the male pronuclei of the fertilized eggs were microinjected with approximately 2 picoliters of dna at a concentration of 1 nglpl the injected fertilized eggs were then transferred into the ampullae of half-day pseudopregnant recipient cd-l female mice to complete their development when the litters were 4 weeks old l-2 cm of their tails were cut dna was extracted from the tail segments for southern blot analysis dna and rna blots five to ten micrograms of genomic dna from the tails were restricted with ncol ifn-y bglll a or hincll ag the dna was electrophoresed on 08 agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes zetaprobe hybridization with radiolabeled random-primed probes was performed with restriction fragments of the ifn-y cdna gray and goeddel 1983  the genomic ad gene or the a cdna estess et al 1986  northern analysis was of rna isolated from the pancreata and other tissues of nontransgenic and transgenic mice rna was extracted from the tissues by the guanidine hclethanol procedure chirgwin et al 1979  electrophoresed through a 1 agarose 6 formaldehyde gel transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized to either a 50 base oligonucleotide complementary to the first untranslated exon of the human insulin gene the a gene or the ap cdna following three 20 min washes in 01 sds 01 x ssc at 65oc 42oc with the 50 base oligonucleotide probe the filters were exposed to a kodak xar film with an intensifying screen at -70c for 5 days determination urine glucose percentages were determined by dipstick analysis chemstick boehringer manheim of spontaneously expressed urine random blood glucose determinations were made on whole blood using the accucheck ii boehringer manheim or on serum or plasma by standard enzymatic methods mice were considered diabetic when urine glucose was 2-5 and the nonfasting blood glucose was greater than 400 mgldl for 3 consecutive days normal nontransgenic mice never showed glycosuria and had blood glucose concentrations of approximately 100-200 mgdl analysis tissues and fetuses were fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for 24 hr dehydrated in s-29 dehydrant technicon corp cleared in toluene and infiltrated with paraffin three micron sections were cut on a reichert-jung 2040 microtome picked up on poly-l-lysine coated slides and dried in a 37 oven overnight sections were deparaffinized in three changes of toluene and rehydrated through graded alcohols to distilled water the sections were then blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity with hydrogen peroxide-methanol endogenous biotin with avidin-biotin blocking kit vector laboratories and endogenous immunoglobulin binding and then stained for insulin with antibody to human insulin using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method vector laboratories with dab as the chromagen negative controls were no primary antibody nonimmune serum and control tissue positive controls of both human and mouse pancreas were also used sections were also cut at 3 microns and stained with a haematoxylin and eosin stain for viewing morphogenic evaluation selected sections were stained with aldehyde-fuchsin stain to detect b cells approximately three to four sections were initially evaluated from each pancreas several pancreata were also chosen for complete step-sectioning 3 sections every 50 microns additional sections were evaluated when islets were not found on initial sections for analysis of i-a antigen expression 10

ti on  structural insights into ubiquitin recognition and ufd1 interaction of npl4 yusuke sato hikaru tsuchiya atsushi yamagata kei okatsu keiji tanaka yasushi saeki shuya fukai   ubiquitin ub is an essential posttranslational modifier conserved from yeast to mammals13 typically the c-terminal glycine residue of ub is covalently attached to lysine residues of substrate proteins ub itself is also a substrate for ubiquitylation and forms a covalently linked ub chain the ub chain linked via lys48 k48 chain is the primary targeting signal for proteasomal degradation15 polyubiquitylated proteins in isolation can be direct targets of the proteasome whereas those embedded into membranes or assembled into multisubunit complexes need to be extracted or segregated by the conserved aaa-family atpase cdc48 yeast or p97vcp metazoan with the aid of its cofactor complex ufd1npl4 un prior to the proteasomal degradation611 the cellular function or localization of the cdc48p97 atpase is controlled by many cofactors the un heterodimer is one of the best-characterized cofactors1215 the cdc48p97 atpase consists of an n-terminal n domain and two atpase domains d1 and d2 d1 and d2 form a hexameric double ring with a central pore16 the conformation of the n domain relative to the d1-d2 ring is coupled to the nucleotide state of d1 the n domain is located above the d1 ring in the atp state up conformation and is coplanar with the d1 ring in the adp state down conformation1721 in addition relative rotations between the d1 and d2 rings occur upon binding of atp to d2 although understanding the mechanism of the substrate translocation accompanied with the ub chain binding and atp hydrolysis has been a long-standing problem recent structural and functional studies provided important mechanistic insights into reacting steps of the cdc48p97un complex22 the un heterodimer captures the substrate-attached ub chain at the initial step15 npl4 is responsible for recognition of the substrate-attached ub chain and thus likely mediates a ub chain-associated reacting step15 the mammalian npl4 also known as nploc4 consists of a ubx-like ubxl domain zinc-finger domain previously designated as zf-npl4 mpr1pad1 n-terminal mpn domain c-terminal domain ctd and nzf domain the mammalian npl4 binds to ub chains without linkage specificity through the nzf domain on the other hand yeast npl4 lacks the nzf domain and binds specifically to k48 chains via zf-npl4-mpn-ctd152324 the mpn domain of npl4 topologically resembles the catalytic domain of the jab1mpnmov34 metalloenzyme jamm-family deubiquitylating enzyme dub19 which accommodates the c-terminal tail of ub therefore the groove corresponding to the catalytic site of jamm dubs2526 has been proposed as a potential ub-binding site of npl4 however a recent cryo-em analysis of the substrate-engaged cdc48un complex at 39  resolution has shown that the k48 chain on the substrate does not interact with the groove of ynpl4 mpn but with ctd and other regions of mpn22 nevertheless due to the low local resolution the density for ufd1 was not interpreted with the atomic model and the interaction between npl4 and the two folded ub moieties has not been characterized in detail22 here we present the crystal structures of yeast npl4 zf-npl4-mpn-ctd in complex with lys48-linked diubiquitin k48-ub2 and with ufd1 at 255 and 158  resolutions respectively the crystal structures reveal that the distal and proximal ub ubdist and ubprox respectively moieties of k48-ub2 interact with the c-terminal helix and n-terminal loop n loop of npl4 ctd respectively and that ufd1 binds to the groove of npl4 corresponding to the catalytic groove of jamm in vitro and in vivo mutational analyses confirm that the npl4 mpn groove is required for binding to ufd1 but not to k48 chains also npl4 mutants that are designed to disrupt the ub binding show that the interaction between the npl4 c-terminal helix and ub is critical for the ub chain binding and stimulation of the atpase activity of the cdc48un complex moreover we reveal that mutations on the proximal ub-binding site of npl4 affect its linkage-specificity our crystallographic and biochemical studies provide essentially important insights to understand the reaction mechanism of the cdc48p97un complex the region containing residues 113580 of saccharomyces cerevisiae npl4 ynpl4113580 with the prefix y indicating saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins specifically recognizes k48 chains in vitro fig 115 the triple e123a k124a e125a mutation was introduced to reduce excess surface conformational entropy27 the ynpl4113580 e123a k124a e125a protein yielded high-quality crystals and its structure was determined at 172  resolution by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction sad method using the zinc edge table 1 we also attempted to crystallize ynpl4113580 in complex with k48 chains although k48-ub2 k48-ub3 k48-ub4 and k48-ub5 were tested for crystallization of the complex only k48-ub2 was successfully co-crystallized with ynpl4113580 eventually we determined the crystal structure of ynpl4113580 in complex with selenomethionine semet-labeled k48-ub2 at 255  resolution fig 2a and table 1 the structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using ynpl4113580 alone as the search model although molecular replacement using ub pdb 1ubq 102210pdb1ubqpdb28 as the search model was unsuccessful we found residual electron density corresponding to k48-ub2 and manually built the model of k48-ub2 the final model contains one ynpl4113580k48-ub2 complex and one isolated ynpl4113580 molecule in the asymmetric unit we here note that the electron density of k48-ub2 is weak especially of ubprox supplementary fig 1a the electron density of the ynpl4-interacting part of ubprox is observed whereas the solvent exposed part of ubprox is obscured supplementary fig 1a b to confirm the positions of ubdist and ubprox we replaced pro19 val26 or ile30 of ub with semet and calculated the anomalous difference fourier map in the ynpl4113580k48-ub2 complex supplementary fig 1c although some signals derived from semet were indistinguishable or not detected we detected the signals derived from semet1 semet19 and semet26 of the ubdist and semet1 semet26 and semet30 of the ubprox the ynpl4113580 structure consists of three subdomains zf-npl4 mpn and ctd similarly to the previously reported structures of npl41922 the ynpl4 mpn subdomain consists of the mpn core and two insertions ins-1 residues 287317 and ins-2 residues 403462 similarly to other mpn dubs the ubdist moiety contacts the ctd subdomain of ynpl4 with a buried surface area of 460 2 fig 2b the ubprox moiety contacts the ctd and mpn subdomains of ynpl4 with a buried surface area of 468 2 although the electron density corresponding to the c-terminal five residues arg-leu-arg-gly-gly of ubdist and the lys48 side chain of ubprox are invisible fig 2c the cc distance between leu71 of ubdist and lys48 of ubprox 11  is within the range of those in the previously reported crystal structures of k48 chains in complex with their specific effectors sars plpro29 airapl30 and mindy-131 920  furthermore we examined the ynpl4k48-ub2 crystals by sds-page supplementary fig 1d and confirmed that the linkage of k48-ub2 was retained in the crystals therefore we concluded that the isopeptide bond connects ubdist and ubprox in the present ynpl4k48-ub2 structure no large conformational difference was observed between ynpl4113580 alone and ynpl4113580k48-ub2 except for the region comprising residues 290300 in ins-1 whose conformation is constrained by crystal packing supplementary fig 2a ubdist of k48-ub2 interacts primarily with the c-terminal helix of ynpl4 ctd fig 2b met574 and ile575 form a hydrophobic surface to interact with the ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of ubdist this hydrophobic interaction is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between thr571 of ynpl4 and the main-chain nh groups of ala46 and gly47 in ubdist adjacent to the c-terminal helix-mediated interactions tyr501 and ile538 of ynpl4 project into a hydrophobic pocket formed by leu8 his68 and val70 of ubdist to assess the roles of these interactions in the ub chain recognition by npl4 we examined the binding of the t571a m574a m574q and i575a mutants of ynpl4 to k48 chains by surface-plasmon resonance spr spectroscopy table 2 the spr analysis of mutant ynpl4 was performed using k48-ub4 because the affinity for k48-ub2 was too low to be analyzed longer ub chains bind to their effectors with higher affinity in general303233 the t571a mutation of ynpl4113580 decreased the affinity for k48-ub4 to 50 of the wild-type affinity table 2 the i575a mutation of ynpl4113580 decreased the affinity to an unmeasurable level the m574a mutation of ynpl4113580 had a weak effect and decreased the affinity for k48-ub4 to 43 of the wild-type affinity on the other hand the m574q mutation had a greater effect than the m574a mutation and decreased the affinity for k48-ub4 to 91 of the wild-type affinity this is likely because the hydrophilic side chain of gln inhibits the hydrophobic interaction between ynpl4113580 and ubdist we further analyzed the affinities between ynpl4113580 mutants and k63- or m1-ub4 the t571a m574a m574q or i575a mutation decreased the affinity for k63- or m1-ub4 to an unmeasurable level table 2 these results suggest that the ynpl4ubdist interface primarily contributes to the affinity for ub chains rather than the linkage specificity next the binding between the cdc48un complex and k48 chains was analyzed by gst pulldown assays gst-ynpl4 mutants were immobilized to glutathione beads and incubated with cdc48 yufd1 and k48 chains after washing the bound proteins were eluted with lds-loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ub antibody fig 2d and supplementary fig 3a in this assay yufd1 or cdc48 had a little effect on the binding to k48 chains and the un or cdc48un complex formation was not affected by the mutations of ynpl4 examined in this study on the other hands the t571a m574q or i575a mutation which had a severe effect on the k48-ub4 binding completely abolished the binding of cdc48un for k48 chains the m574a mutation which had a mild effect on the affinity for k48-ub4 did not completely eliminate the binding similar gst pulldown assays using gst-yufd1 instead of gst-ynpl4 showed consistent results supplementary fig 3b to further assess the functional significance of the ynpl4ubdist interaction in vivo mutant ynpl4-3xflag was expressed under its own promoter in npl4 cells ynpl4-3xflag was immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibody and co-immunoprecipitation of lys48-linked polyubiquitylated proteins were analyzed with anti-k48 chain antibody supplementary fig 3c in agreement with the result of the in vitro binding assay the t571a m574q or i575a mutation decreased the amount of co-immunoprecipitated lys48-linked polyub conjugates although these mutations had little effect on cdc48 binding previous studies showed that ufd1 binds to k48 chains through its ut3 domain2434 however our pulldown analysis failed to detect the binding of yufd1 to k48 chains supplementary fig 3b we next analyzed the binding between the gst-ynpl4 and k48 chains on increasing concentrations of yufd1 by gst pulldown assay but did not observe substantial effects supplementary fig 3d spr analysis using the purified yufd1ynpl4113580 complex and k48-ub4 also showed that the presence of yufd1 has little effect on the affinity of ynpl4 for k48-ub4 table 2 although the kd value of yufd1 for polyub has not been estimated that for monoub was estimated to be within the range of 12 mm34 this value is much higher than the kd value of ynpl4 for k48-ub2 or k48-ub4 table 2 suggesting that the affinity of yufd1 for k48 chains is much lower than that for ynpl4 collectively these in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the c-terminal helix of ynpl4 is the key determinant for ub chain recognition by the cdc48un complex ubprox of k48-ub2 mainly interacts with the n loop of ynpl4 ctd residues 493501 fig 2b the n loop of ynpl4 ctd interacts with the hydrophobic patch formed by leu8 ile44 and val70 of ubprox ser498 of ynpl4 forms a hydrogen bond with arg42 of ubprox the main-chain co group of gln493 in ynpl4 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain nh group of leu71 in ubprox the functional importance of these interactions was confirmed by spr analyses using the a494f s498l and s498r mutants of his6-ynpl4113580 table 2 the s498l mutation of ynpl4 had a little effect on the affinity for k48- k63- and m1-ub4 whereas the s498r mutation of ynpl4 decreased the affinity for k48-ub4 to 36 of the wild-type affinity table 2 these results suggest that the n loop of ynpl4 ctd is a binding site for ubprox although the contribution of the n loop to k48-ub4 binding is smaller than that of the c-terminal helix reflecting this gaps are found in the interface between ynpl4 and ubprox one of the gaps is located between ala494 of ynpl4 and leu8 of ubprox the phe replacement of ala494 in ynpl4 increased the affinity of ynpl4 for k48-ub4 22-fold table 2 it is likely that the bulky side chain of phe filled the gap and increased the affinity the involvement of the n loop of ynpl4 ctd in the ubprox recognition was further supported by gst pulldown assays using the cdc48un complex containing a gst-ynpl4 mutant the a494f mutation of ynpl4 enhanced the binding between cdc48un and k48 chains whereas the s498r mutation decreased it fig 2d similar results were obtained even when the gst tag was fused to ufd1 instead of npl4 supplementary fig 3b the s498r or a494f mutation hardly affected the affinity for k63- or m1-ub4 in contrast to that for k48-ub4 and thereby changed the linkage specificity represented by the reciprocal ratio of dissociation constants table 2 the affinity of wild-type ynpl4 for k48-ub4 was 11 and 15 times higher than that for k63- or m1-ub4 respectively the s498r mutation of the ynpl4 decreased the linkage specificity in contrast the a494f mutant of ynpl4 increased the linkage specificity because this mutant increases the affinity for k48-ub4 but hardly affects that for k63- or m1-ub4 table 2 these results indicate that the interaction between ubprox and the n loop of ynpl4 ctd contributes to the specificity of ynpl4 to k48 chains lys48-linked polyubiquitylated gfp k48-ubn-gfp has been used as a model substrate that can stimulate the atp hydrolysis of the cdc48un complex1314 to evaluate the coupling between the binding to a k48 chain and atp hydrolysis in the cdc48un complex we analyzed the rate of the atp hydrolysis by the cdc48un complex containing mutant ynpl4 addition of k48-ubn-gfp increased the atp hydrolysis rate of the cdc48un complex depending on the affinity of ynpl4 for k48 chains fig 2e and supplementary fig 3e for instance k48-ubn-gfp increased the atp hydrolysis rate of the cdc48un complex approximately 5-fold the t571a m574q or i575a mutation at the ynpl4ubdist interface which severely decreases the affinity for k48 chains decreased the atp hydrolysis rate the s498r mutation at the ynpl4ubprox interface which shows a mild effect on the affinity also decreased the atpase hydrolysis rate but less than the t571a m574q or i575a mutation these results indicate that the stimulation of the atpase activity of the cdc48un complex requires the binding activity of ynpl4 ctd to k48 chains npl4 and ufd1 can form a heterodimer even in the absence of cdc48p97 or a polyubiquitylated substrate the mechanism of the ufd1npl4 interaction remains unclear although residues 258275 of human ufd1 hufd1258275 with the prefix h indicating the human protein equivalent to residues 288305 of yufd yufd1288305 have been assigned as the npl4-binding motif nbm fig 135 indeed fluorescence anisotropy-based affinity measurement using flash-labeled yufd1288305 showed that yufd1288305 binds to ynpl4 with kd of 857 nm table 3 to further reveal the structural basis of the interaction between npl4 and ufd1 we determined the crystal structure of ynpl4113580 e123a k124a e125a in complex with yufd1288305 fig 3a b and table 1 the structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using ynpl4113580 alone as the search model in the crystal ynpl4113580 formed a stoichiometric complex with yufd1288305 no large conformational difference was observed between ynpl4113580 alone and the yufd1288305-bound ynpl4113580 supplementary fig 2b in the complex residues 298300 of yufd1 nbm form a -sheet with ins-1 of ynpl4 fig 3c d leu296 phe326 leu353 met357 phe419 pro420 and tyr424 of ynpl4 form a hydrophobic groove to accommodate pro289 leu292 leu294 gly297 leu299 phe301 phe303 and met305 of yufd1 mutations of all these residues except for pro420 of ynpl4 and pro289 of yufd1 were examined by fluorescent anisotropy-based binding analysis table 3 the mutation of leu296 leu353 or tyr424 of ynpl4 or leu292 gly297 leu299 or phe301 of yufd1 severely affected the affinity between yufd1288305 and ynpl4113580 the ala replacement of leu292 leu299 or phe301 in yufd1288305 decreased the affinity to 16 068 or 041 of the wild-type affinity respectively the leu arg or tyr replacement of gly297 of yufd1288305 decreased the affinity for ynpl4113580 to 14 041 or 40 of the wild-type affinity respectively the backbone dihedral angles  and  of gly297 are 901 and 85 respectively molprobity36 a standard program for protein structure validation judges these angles as favored angles for gly but allowed angles for non-glypro residues gly is more favorable than non-glypro residues at residue 297 yufd1 nbm is kinked at gly297 thereby fitting into the hydrophobic groove in the mpn subdomain of ynpl4 fig 3b gly297 and phe301 of yufd1 are conserved from yeast to human whereas leu299 of yufd1 is replaced by functionally equivalent hydrophobic residues among other eukaryotes fig 3c although the sequence of ufd1 nbm is variable among eukaryotes this gxxf motif x and  represent any amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids respectively is well conserved reflecting its functional importance fig 3c the ala replacement of leu296 phe326 leu353 or tyr424 of ynpl4113580 decreased the affinity to 12 33 62 or 10 of the wild-type affinity respectively table 3 notably leu296 phe326 and tyr424 of ynpl4 are conserved in hnpl4 supplementary fig 4 leu296 and phe326 of ynpl4 interact with leu299 and phe301 of yufd1 which occupy the third and fifth positions of the gxxf motif and tyr424 of ynpl4 hydrophobically interacts with the main-chain co group of ala290 and the c atom of lys291 in yufd1 these hydrophobic interactions are likely conserved from yeast to human in addition to the hydrophobic interactions arg364 and thr418 of ynpl4 form hydrogen bonds with glu296 and the main-chain nh group of ala290 in yufd1 respectively the e296a mutation of yufd1288305 or the r364a mutation of ynpl4113580 decreased the affinity to 20 or 27 of the wild-type affinity respectively table 3 these residues are not conserved between yeast and human the hydrophilic interactions between npl4 and ufd1 may be variable among species the catalytic groove in the mpn domain of jamm-family dubs accommodates the c-terminal tail of ub for cleavage252637 the first insertion in the jamm core ie ins-1 forms a -sheet with the c-terminal tail of ub in the catalytic groove fig 3d npl4 is enzymatically inactive but has ins-1 and a groove similar to the catalytic groove of jamm-family dubs19 therefore this groove and ins-1 have been assumed to form a potential ub chain-binding site however the present ynpl4113580yufd1288305 structure reveals that the groove of the mpn domain accommodates yufd1 nbm fig 3d the npl4-bound yufd1 does not overlap with k48-ub2 in the ynpl4k48-ub2 complex consistently yufd1 did not inhibit the binding of k48 chains to ynpl4 fig 2d supplementary fig 3d in addition the recently reported cryo-em structure of the substrate-engaged cdc48-un showed that the bound k48 chain and ufd1 do not overlap with each other in spite of the similarity of the mpn domains of npl4 and jamm dubs the functions of ins-1 and the groove are different between them to analyze the relationship between the ufd1npl4 interaction and cdc48un assembly we first screened for mutations that effectively inhibit the interaction between yufd1 and ynpl4 by gst pulldown experiments with full-length proteins although single point mutations of ynpl4 or yufd1 hardly affected the ynpl4yufd1 interaction supplementary fig 5a b triple mutations of ynpl4 l296a l353a y424a or yufd1 g297r l299a f301a completely inhibited the formation of the un heterodimer respectively fig 3e and supplementary fig 5a b the triple mutant ynpl4 was confirmed to bind to k48 chains as well as wild-type ynpl4 supplementary fig 5c next we analyzed the effect of ynpl4 or yufd1 mutations on the cdc48un assembly by gst pulldown experiments and found that the triple mutants of either ynpl4 or yufd1 substantially reduced the formation of the cdc48un complex fig 3f and supplementary fig 5d thus the un heterodimer formation facilitates the cdc48un assembly although both ynpl4 and yufd1 can directly bind to cdc48 to further assess the functional significance of the ufd1npl4 interaction in vivo mutated npl4-3xflag or ufd1-3xflag was expressed in npl4 or ufd1 cells respectively we examined the accumulation of ub conjugates in total cell lysate in these cells the npl4-1 temperature-sensitive strain was also examined as an npl4-deficient control the levels of ub conjugates were not changed in the cells that expressed ynpl4 or yufd1 single-point mutants supplementary fig 5e in contrast in the cells expressing the triple mutant of ynpl4 or yufd1 we observed a substantial accumulation of ub conjugates which was comparable to that in the npl4-1 cell supplementary fig 5e correspondingly these triple mutant-expressing cells displayed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype although it was milder than the npl4-1 phenotype supplementary fig 5f these findings indicate that the ufd1npl4 interaction is important for the degradation of ub conjugates and for the cell growth npl4 is a highly conserved protein from yeast to mammals in mammalian npl4 the nzf domain located in its c-terminus binds to k48 chains and lys63-linked ub chains k63 chains the human npl4 hnpl4 mutant lacking the nzf domain hardly binds to ub chains15 on the other hand the ascomycota and plantae npl4 proteins lack the nzf domain in their c-termini supplementary fig 6a b the npl4 proteins from s cerevisiae and c thermophilum bind to k48 chains via the zf-npl4-mpn-ctd domain19 multiple amino-acid sequence alignment including ynpl4 and hnpl4 shows that the ubdist-interacting residues in the c-terminal helix of the ctd are partially conserved between yeast and human thr571 of ynpl4 is conserved and ile575 of ynpl4 is replaced with leu in hnpl4 which should be functionally equivalent to ile supplementary fig 6a intriguingly the t551a mutation of hnpl4 equivalent to thr571 of ynpl4 decreased the affinity for k48-ub4 to 58 of the wild-type affinity table 2 on the other hand met574 of ynpl4 is replaced with gln in hnpl4 and with ala in s pombe the m574q mutation of ynpl4 decreased the affinity for k48-ub4 to 91 of the wild-type affinity whereas the m574a mutation decreased it to just 43 table 2 reciprocally the q554m mutation of hnpl4 equivalent to met574 of ynpl4 increased the affinity for k48-ub4 about two-fold table 2 these findings suggest that the c-terminal helix of hnpl4 ctd is also involved in binding to a ub chain like that of ynpl4 ctd to assess the functional equivalence between ynpl4 ctd and hnpl4 nzf in the context of the ub chain binding and the cdc48 atpase activity we investigated engineered ynpl4 proteins where the nzf domain of hnpl4 including the linker region between the ctd and nzf domains was fused to the c-terminal end of the full-length ynpl4 ynpl4-nzf with or without mutations deficient in binding to ub chains t571a or i575a gst pulldown analysis showed that ynpl4-nzf bound to both k48 and k63 chains even with the t571a or i575a mutation indicating that the nzf fusion can rescue the defect of ub chain binding of the ctd mutations fig 4a b and supplementary fig 6c next we analyzed whether the ynpl4-nzf proteins support the k48 chain-dependent atpase activity of the cdc48 complex fig 4c and supplementary fig 6d the nzf fusion to wild-type ynpl4 did not enhance the atpase activity above the wild-type level probably because the affinity of wild-type ynpl4 for k48 chains is sufficient to stimulate the full atpase activity of cdc48 on the other hand the nzf fusion completely recovered the decrease in the atpase stimulation by the t571a or i575a mutation suggesting that ynpl4 ctd and hnpl4 nzf are functionally equivalent this also raises the possibility that the enhancement of atp hydrolysis is independent of lys48-linkage specificity however k63 chains did not stimulate the atpase activity of the cdc48un complex containing ynpl4-nzf which can bind to k63 chains as well as to k48 chains fig 4c thus the stimulation of the atpase activity of the cdc48un complex actually depends on lys48-linkage specificity of ynpl4 considering that lys48-linkage specificity of ynpl4 ctd is dispensable for the stimulation of the atp hydrolysis one may expect that ynpl4 yufd1 andor cdc48 have additional lys48-linkage-specific recognition sites besides npl4 ctd the cryo-em structure of the substrate-engaged cdc48un has shown that ynpl4 mpn binds to unfolded ub which bridges between ubprox and the central pore of cdc4822 supplementary fig 6e this binding may be related to the k48 chain-specific stimulation of the atpase activity of cdc48 in this study we determined the crystal structure of the ynpl4113580k48-ub2 complex both ubdist and ubprox interact with ynpl4 ctd which is a newly identified ub-binding domain fig 5a the c-terminal helix of ynpl4 ctd is the primary ub-binding site of ynpl4 among the previously reported ub-binding domains ubds ub-interacting motif uim motif interacting with ub miu and uim and miu related ubd umi have a single helix as a ub-binding site ynpl4 ctd miu and umi but not uim exhibit the same helix orientation relative to the bound ub therefore we compared the ub-binding helices of ynpl4 ctd rnf168 umi pdb 5xis 102210pdb5xispdb38 and rabex5 miu pdb 2c7n 102210pdb2c7npdb39 fig 5b these ubds have an n-terminal hydrophilic residue for hydrogen bonding with the nh groups of ala46 and gly47 of ub and a central hydrophobic residue for the interaction with the hydrophobic pocket formed by leu8 ile44 and val70 of ub fig 5b c the differences of the n-terminal hydrophilic residue and central hydrophobic residue in the ub-binding helix affect its orientation relative to ub the central hydrophobic residues are ile in npl4 ctd and umi and ala in miu the longer side chain of ile in ynpl4 ctd or umi pushes out the c-terminal end of the helical ubd whereas those n-terminal hydrophilic residues move close proximity to the nh groups of ala46 and gly47 of ub because of this proximity the n-terminal hydrophilic residue of ynpl4 ctd and umi are thr and ser respectively which are shorter than asp the n-terminal hydrophilic residue of miu the cryo-em structure of the substrate-engaged cdc48un22 contains two folded ub moieties which correspond to ubdist and ubprox in the present crystal structure of ynpl4113580k48-ub2 fig 6a in both structures the c-terminal helix of ynpl4 ctd interacts with the ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of ubdist fig 6b and therefore the ubdist recognition mode of ynpl4 is essentially the same on the other hand the ubprox recognition mode is different in the ynpl4k48-ub2 structure ser498 of ynpl4 forms a hydrogen bond with arg42 of ubprox gst pulldown and spr analysis of the s498r mutant of ynpl4 showed that ser498 of ynpl4 is actually involved in binding to k48 chains fig 2d supplementary fig 3b and table 2 in the structure of the substrate-engaged cdc48un ubprox moves toward cdc48 by 10  as compared with ynpl4k48-ub2 and does not interact with ser498 of ynpl4 fig 6b this ubprox movement appears to be coupled with threading of the unfolded ub moiety ie ubprox interacts with ser498 of ynpl4 at the initial ub chain recognition step at the subsequent substrate-threading step the unfolded ub is inserted into the central pore of cdc48 and pulls ubprox which loses its interaction with ser498 of ynpl4 we also determined the crystal structure of ynpl4113580yufd1288305 we docked the structure of the nbm region of ufd1 into the cryo-em structure of the substrate-engaged cdc48un22 fig 6c the present yufd1288305 model was nicely fitted into the unassigned density observed in the cryo-em map fig 6c d which was supposed to correspond to a part of yufd122 this indicates that the ynpl4ufd1 interaction revealed by crystallography of the un complex similarly occurs in the substrate-engaged cdc48un fig 6d inhibitors of ub-proteasome system ups have recently been developed as anticancer drugs40 because the p97cdc48un complex plays crucial roles upstream of the proteasome its inhibition has emerged as a novel therapeutic target in cancer cells41 however since p97cdc48 also plays various roles outside the ups pathway its inhibition may affect many cell functions in the context disruptions of the specific p97-cofactor association will likely lead to the novel p97 inhibitors with enhanced specificity of anticancer activity inhibition of the interaction between ufd1 and npl4 prevents formation of the cdc48-un complex fig 3f our present structure of ynpl4113580yufd1288305 might facilitate the development of such anticancer drugs by serving as a useful platform for structure-based design the codon-optimized cdnas of ynpl4 hnpl4 and yufd1 were
