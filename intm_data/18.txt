novel coronavirus covid-19 emerged in china in december 2019 and as of 3rd march 2020 more than 90800 cases and 3100 deaths have been reported from 72 countries world health organisation who 2020 most of the cases and deaths have occurred in wuhan city in china where the outbreak started as drugs or vaccines are not yet available various non-pharmaceutical measures have been recommended to reduce the spread of infection including hygiene and disinfection improving environmental control early detection and reporting isolation quarantine use of personal protective equipment social distancing and travel restrictions world health organization who 2014 bell et al 2006 in most pandemic plans tiered strategies which target front line health workers first followed by the general community are usually defined yet many of these strategies have some level of controversy attached and lack a large evidence base macintyre et al 2014 some are starting to be phased out in some settings such as the use of thermal scanners at airports due to a lack of evidence especially for infections with pre-symptomatic transmission gunaratnam et al 2014 however the use of other interventions continues to be debatedthe lack of agreement on the selection and use of masks medical or surgical facemasks and respirators n95p2ffp2 or equivalent is reflected in inconsistent and conflicting policies worldwide macintyre et al 2014a chughtai et al 2013 masks and respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory infections particularly during the initial periods of outbreaks pandemics when other control measures not yet available aiello et al 2010a aledort et al 2007 in this paper we examined existing policies of selected health organization and countries on the use of masks and respirators to protect hospital health workers from covid-19while there is a high level of agreement amongst key agencies that masks and respirators play a role in the protection of health workers there are currently discrepancies between these agencies regarding how and when the different products are used the world health organization who the us centers for disease control and prevention and other leading health organisations have different recommendations for the selection of respiratory protection for example the who recommends using masks to protect health workers from covid-19 during routine care and respirators during aerosol generating procedures world health organisation who 2020 in contrast the us centers for disease control and prevention center for disease control and prevention cdc 2020 and the european center for disease prevention and control european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2020 recommend using respirators during both routine care of covid19 patients and high risk situations individual countries also have different policies some are in line with the who and others with the us centers for disease control and prevention for example the australian communicable diseases network australia cdna and canadian guidelines government of canada align with the who while uk public health england and chinese guidelines chinese center for disease control and prevention 2020 align with the us centers for disease control and prevention and european center for disease prevention and control while all organisations recommend using n95 p2ffp2 or equivalent respirators public health england uk recommends using filtering facepiece 3 ffp3 respirators for all cases and the european center for disease prevention and control recommends using ffp3 during aerosol generating procedures australian guidelines also recommend powered air purifying respirators while performing aerosol generating procedures on multiple patients although us centers for disease control and prevention guidelines also discuss powered air purifying respirators indication of their use is not clearthese conflicting policies may cause confusion for hospital managers nurses and other health workers conflicting guidelines have resulted in a large amount of online debate between infectious disease providers and infection prevention control experts about what approaches should be adopted history is repeating itself with the same controversies around powered air purifying respirators during the ebola epidemic in 2014 macintyre et al 2014a macintyre et al 2014b the policies and guidelines regarding the use of masksrespirators for health organisations are also inconsistent for other infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov pandemic influenza and ebola virus disease macintyre et al 2014a chughtai et al 2013the only similarity is that all health organisations and countries generally recommend the use of masks by suspected or infected cases of covid-19 ie source control to prevent spread of infections they simultaneously state that community use of masks has no benefit yet there are more randomised controlled clinical trials rcts supporting the use of masks in the community than for source control the community trials show a benefit of face masks with or without hand hygiene conditional on compliance simmerman et al 2011 aiello et al 2012 aiello et al 2010b suess et al 2012 macintyre et al 2009 cowling et al 2009 there are only two rcts of clinical efficacy of source control canini et al 2010 macintyre et al 2016 and one small experimental rct of 9 subjects johnson et al 2009 these suggest a benefit but larger trials are neededthe main difference in masks and respirators is their intended use masks were originally designed to prevent spread of infections from wearers to other people around them referred to as source control they are also used to protect from infections transmitted through the droplet mode and splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids disposable medical or surgical masks are common types of face masks used by both health workers and general public in contrast to this respirators are designed for respiratory protection a medical or surgical mask may be enough to prevent droplet transfer while a respirator is required for airborne infection in terms of mask use the physical barrier may also prevent contact transmission such as hand to facemouthnose a respirator may provide protection against multiple modes of transmission including droplet airborne and hand-to-mouthnose transmission whilst the relative contribution of each mode is difficult to quantify clinically the debate about the modes of transmission is academic if an intervention is shown to prevent infectionlike other coronavirus diseases eg sars and mers covid-19 is believed to be transmitted through droplet and contact modes however other transmission modes such as airborne are likely given the virus is found in higher concentrations in the lungs than the upper respiratory tract world health organisation who 2020 there had been evidence of airborne transmission of sars as well therefore respirators were recommended for sars during 200203 outbreak mckinney et al 2006 in canada initially masks were recommended but this recommendation was later changed to respirators due to the deaths of health workers a recent study demonstrated the presence of coronavirus in anal swabs from infected patients and possibility of transmission through faecal-oral route zhang et al 2020 transmission dynamics for covid-19 are still unclear and pharmaceutical control measures are not yet available therefore n95 or higher respirators should be offered to health workers who are working at the frontline macintyre et al 2014a macintyre et al 2014b health workers and other first responders in high coronavirus transmission areas eg wuhan should use respirators during routine care of coronavirus cases health workers and first responders in low risk countries should use a respirator when encountering a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus if respirators are not available then masks should be usedextended use and reuse of masks and respirators was a common practice during past epidemics and pandemics due to shortage of products chughtai et al 2015 beckman et al 2013 lautenbach et al 2010 rebmann and wagner 2009 according to the us centers for disease control and prevention extended use refers to the practice of wearing the same n95 respirator for repeated close contact encounters with several patients without removing the respirator between patient encounters center for disease control and prevention cdc 2014a the us centers for disease control and prevention defines re-use as the practice of using the same n95 respirator for multiple encounters with patients but removing it doffing after each encounter center for disease control and prevention cdc 2014a shortages of respirators were reported in many hospitals in us and japan during the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic and staff had to use medical masks lautenbach et al 2010 rebmann and wagner 2009 tomizuka et al 2013currently the single use of medical mask and ffp respirators is recommended but this is not always feasible during a pandemic or extended outbreak medical masks and ffp respirators may not be available for everyone therefore the us centers for disease control and prevention and other health organisations have previously considered the extended use and re-use of medical masks and respirators during outbreaks pandemics and other high demand situations center for disease control and prevention cdc 2014a occupational safety and health administration osha 2009 institute of medicine iom national academy of sciences 2006 during recent covid-19 epidemics the shortage of masks and respirators have been reported from many countries however the outer surface of medical masks or respirators may be contaminated and may be a source of infection institute of medicine iom national academy of sciences 2010 viscusi et al 2009 a recent study showed that pathogens may be present on the outer surface of around 10 masks and risks increase with prolonged mask use chughtai et al 2019 the number of viral particles and length of survival are important factors to consider in case re-use is deemed essential institute of medicine iom national academy of sciences 2010currently there is a lack of data regarding the period for which the same mask or respirators may be continuously used and none of guideline address this available data suggest that respirators may be used intermittently or continuously for around eight hours center for disease control and prevention cdc 2014b and that adverse effects of facemasks increase with more than eight hours use shenal et al 2012 it has been suggested that extended use of facemasks is acceptable if the mask is not wet and soiled however there are currently no clinical studies supporting this practice occupational safety and health administration osha 2009 sonoma county department of health services 2006policies and guidelines should also mention implementation of a comprehensive respiratory protection program for respirator use which includes selection of certified respirators training and fit checking and testing and inspection maintenance and storage occupational safety and health administration osha 2002 certified respirators should be used in healthcare settings and certification processes should be managed by a regulatory body for example in the us the national institute for occupational safety and health regulates the certification process under regulation 42 cfr 84 national institute for occupational safety and health niosh 1995 similarly in europe the european norm standard european directive and in australia as nzs 1716 standard regulates respirator use standards australia limitedstandards new zealand 2012 all guidelines except the who and the australian guidelines briefly discuss the need for fit testing but do not provide detail on fit testing procedures the who and the australian guidelines do not mention fit testing and instead mention fit check or seal-check which is not equivalent to fit testing all guidelines however highlight the importance of training for respiratory and other personal protective equipment usesumming up in the case of serious emerging infections like covid-19 the precautionary principle should be used for frontline health workers and a properly fitted respirator should be used if respirators are not available masks should be used extended use and reuse are high risk practices and may lead to self-contamination to the wearer and should be avoided in case of shortage extended use should be balanced against the risk of infections and the wearer should not remove masks between patients encounters there should be a uniform policy around the use of personal protective equipment to avoid confusion which places occupational health and safety of health workers as a high priorityabrar ahmad chughtai had testing of filtration of masks by 3 m for his phd more than 5 years ago 3 m products were not used in his research he also has worked with cleanspace technology on research on fit testing of respirators no funding was involved c raina macintyre receives funding from nhmrc center for research excellence and principal research fellowship and sanofi currently she has received funding from 3 m more than 10 years ago for face mask researchthe coronavirus covid-19 was declared a global pandemic by world health organization who on march 11 2020 after it was known to originate from wuhan china and resulted in more than 381000 confirmed cases around the world at the time 12 very little is known about its effect among those responsible for its management and treatment primarily the doctors nurses and the first responders the coronavirus causes an acute respiratory infection that is transmitted by contact and droplet routes the use of personnel protective equipment ppe such as surgical gloves face masks eye protection and regular hand washing is known to limit the spread of the virus but little is known about the relative efficacy of n95 masks over the regular surgical masks in preventing the transmission of the virus among health care workers hcws this aspect of identifying the superior type of respiratory protective equipment rpe is of significant importance in order to provide maximal protection to hcws prevent medical equipment shortages and to lessen the burden on manufacturers and suppliers of this equipment both types of face masks are known to prevent the transmission of respiratory particles however the n95 masks are thought to have a superior efficacy by filtering out very small particles in spite of having many benefits the n95 masks have certain limitations and it is important to understand if the benefits outweigh the risks when compared to surgical masks this case helps us better understand the efficacy and benefits of different types of rpe used by hcws during the management of patients infected with the coronavirusa 55-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus was admitted to the intensive care unit icu in early march 2020 for severe shortness of breath she had recently returned from a trip to iran and was suspected to have been in contact with people infected with the coronavirus on admission she was given high-flow supplemental oxygen that slightly improved her shortness of breath however after a few hours her respiratory status worsened and she was intubated and mechanically ventilated in the icu the hcws who performed the aforementioned procedures used either the n95 mask or the surgical mask depending upon availability and personal preference the patients respiratory status gradually improved over a period of two days in accordance with existing guidelines the patient was extubated and shifted to the isolation ward for further management three samples of nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient for three consecutive days for covid-19 testing and all came out positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on polymerase chain reaction pcr assay all the 34 hcws exposed to the patient were isolated and quarantined for a period of 14 days information was obtained about the type of rpe used by each hcw during exposure to the patient half of the hcws used surgical masks whereas the rest used n95 masks as the rpe while performing procedures on the infected patient during this period of quarantine routine surveillance monitoring for cough shortness of breath and muscle aches was made two samples of nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the hcws on the day of exposure and the last day of quarantine for covid 19 testing via the pcr assay each hcw remained asymptomatic and tested negative for covid 19 on both tests the coronavirus is known to spread through aerosolized particles hcws are at an increased risk of being infected without proper ppe and protective measures this case highlighted the importance of evaluating the efficacy of different rpe during a viral pandemic in protecting the hcws from the transmission of infection none of the hcws who were exposed to the virus tested positive for covid-19 despite using the different types of rpe this helps us in determining the relative efficacy of surgical masks and n95 masks over one another in preventing the transmission of the virus among hcws it can also be deduced that both types of rpe offer equal protection to hcws from the virus however these findings need to be validated by well-designed large-scale studies the observation made in this case report was also highlighted by a previous study which showed that n95 masks were not superior to surgical masks for preventing influenza infection among hcws 3 another study concluded that there was no significant difference between n95 mask and surgical masks in preventing the risk of transmission of respiratory infections from infected patients 4 although the above studies showed no significant difference in efficacy of both types of rpe it is vital to understand that different infectious agents have different mechanisms of transmission and action and hence large-scale randomized controlled trials rcts need to be conducted to better understand the particular pattern and characteristics of sars-cov2 that differentiate it from other respiratory infectious agents with similar features the n95 mask is thought to be superior to the surgical masks these masks are known to filter out 95 of small airborne particles including bacteria and viruses they have been tested and approved by the national institute of occupational safety nios however there are certain limitations to its use since breathing while wearing the n95 mask is harder it is not recommended for the elderly claustrophobics and individuals suffering from lung diseases as it may exacerbate their pre-existing conditions these masks need to be properly fitted on the face every time to ensure that a proper seal is in place to provide maximal protection the inability to form a proper seal does not provide adequate protection this can be difficult to achieve in individuals with facial hair and in children it can also inadvertently lead to frequent contact between the hands and the face while adjusting the mask which further increases the risk of transmission the tight seal also leads to the build-up of heat and humidity within the mask causing discomfort and difficulty in breathing the duration and cost of manufacturing are longer and higher and during a pandemic shortages of this equipment can result in avoidable exposure to hcws during a pandemic or health crisis hcws need to be able to access ppe readily in order to protect themselves patients and their contacts interpretation of this case and the above studies helps us understand the need to urgently conduct large-scale rcts and incorporate the findings of these trials and studies to revise the existing guidelines regarding the use of rpe by hcws and possibly increase the usage of readily available surgical masks in favor of n95 masks for preventing covid-19 transmission till the availability of any conclusive evidence health care providers in direct contact with covid-19 cases should continue the use of n95 respirators as advocated by the current guidelines although this case report helps us in determining the relative efficacy of different rpe in preventing covid-19 transmission there is still a lot more that needs to be studied about the transmission and pathology of the coronavirus to introduce effective measures and equipment that will protect hcws in the future the intricate details about the size and transmission of the virus still need to be studied in depth to figure out the best method of rpe that can be used to prevent its transmission although this case report signifies that there is no superior protection offered by n95 masks in comparison to surgical masks it has certain limitations and additional studies particularly rcts need to be conducted in a health care setting to determine the effectiveness of different rpe which may lead to the revision of existing policies and guidelines regarding the best ways to protect hcws from being infected with the coronavirus in the

health care settings two cohort studies evaluated mask use and risk for sars-cov-2 infection but had important limitations 52 56 one study 493 participants of hcws in higher- and lower-risk hospital units found n95 respirators to be associated with decreased infection risk versus no mask but mask use was based on whether the hcw worked in a department in which masks were used not on assessment of individual use 52 in addition departments with n95 respirator use differed from departments that did not use n95 respirators in other infection control measures such as handwashing and use of protective clothing and exposure to patients with covid-19 there were also few hcw cases and serious imprecision the other study was small 37 participants and evaluated hcws with inadequate personal protective

infectionstwo trials described above included 2 n95 respirator arms 39 40 one trial found that the effects of an n95 respirator versus surgical mask on clinical respiratory illness were similar for fit-tested and nonfit-tested n95 respirators 46 vs 33 39 the other trial found continuous use at all times while working of an n95 respirator to be associated with a small decrease in clinical respiratory illness risk versus intermittent use only during high-risk procedures or barrier situations of an n95 respirator 72 vs 118 40one trial 1868 participants of hcws in higher-risk settings found a surgical mask to be associated with decreased risk for clinical respiratory illness influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed viral infections versus cloth masks but estimates were imprecise and not statistically significant 38one trial of hcws 2862 participants in lower-risk outpatient settings found no differences between an n95 respirator and a surgical mask in risk for clinical respiratory illness influenza-like illness laboratory-confirmed viral illness or laboratory-confirmed influenza 46reporting of harms in the rcts was suboptimal but did not indicate serious harms with mask use supplement table 9 when reported the most common adverse events were discomfort breathing difficulties and skin events one trial found use of an n95 respirator to be associated with increased risk for headache and breathing difficulty compared with a surgical mask in hcws 39 but 1 trial found no difference between a p2 mask n95 respirator equivalent versus surgical mask in adverse events in persons in the community 37 one trial reported no differences in harms between a surgical versus cloth mask in hcws 38this rapid living review summarizes the evidence on the comparative effectiveness and effectiveness for preventing coronavirus and other respiratory infections figure 2 is an evidence map summarizing the strength of evidence for key comparisons by setting and infection type supplement table 10 the map shows that direct evidence on the comparative effectiveness of masks for preventing covid-19 due to sars-cov-2 infection is lacking therefore it was necessary to also consider evidence for other respiratory infections though the applicability to covid-19 is uncertain in addition the strength of evidence varied from moderate to insufficient no comparison was graded high strength of evidencein community settings one rct found no difference between n95 or equivalent respirators versus surgical masks in risk for noncoronavirus respiratory illness 37 the rcts in community settings typically conducted during influenza seasons also did not indicate effectiveness of mask use versus no mask use for reducing viral respiratory infection risk though mask compliance was suboptimal observational data on mask use effectiveness in community settings for preventing infections associated with epidemic coronaviruses were limited but suggest possible reduced risk for sars-1 the difference in findings could be related to higher mask compliance in pandemic outbreak settings greater effectiveness of masks for sars-1 or residual confoundingin hcws observational studies suggest that n95 masks might be associated with decreased risk for sars-cov-1 infection compared with surgical masks and mask use in general appears to be associated with decreased risk for sars-cov-1 infection all studies were conducted in high- or moderate-risk settings with uncertain applicability to low-risk settings those without direct care of infected patients review of rcts indicates that n95 respirators and surgical masks are probably associated with similar risk for influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed viral infections in high- and low-risk settings however there was some inconsistency in effects of n95 respirators versus surgical masks on clinical respiratory infections in high-risk settings with 1 trial 34 showing no difference in physician visits for respiratory illness and 2 trials 39 40 showing n95 respirators to be associated with a small decrease in risk the only trial comparing n95 respirators versus surgical masks in a low-risk primary care setting found no difference in risk for clinical respiratory illness 46 there was no evidence to address effects of extended or reuse of n95 respirators on infection risk evidence on nonclinical outcomes for example measures of filtration contamination and mask failure is summarized elsewhere 5our findings are generally consistent with those of recent systematic reviews on mask use in community and health care settings that found n95 respirators and surgical masks to be associated with similar risk for influenza and influenza-like illness 5862 it differs from prior reviews by considering both randomized trials and observational studies evaluating mask use in community and health care settings considering harms comparing effects of consistent versus less consistent mask use and including a more comprehensive set of relevant studies we also implemented living review processes in order to incorporate new evidence on an ongoing basis there was some overlap between this review and our living review on risk factors including various types of personal protective equipment for coronavirus infections in hcws 12 this review
differed from our prior review by including studies conducted in community settings focusing on mask use and including effects on noncoronavirus viral respiratory infectionsthe evidence base has important limitations as noted the evidence on mask use and risk for sars-cov-2 infection is very sparse in randomized trials adherence to mask use was suboptimal potentially reducing estimates of effectiveness compared with use during pandemic outbreaks when adherence may be higher observational studies were retrospective susceptible to recall bias and confounding and did not address correlations between mask use and other infection prevention and control measures applicability of evidence on masks and risk for sars-cov-1 mers-cov and other viral respiratory illness to sars-cov-2 is uncertain the applicability of evidence on influenza and influenza-like illnesses to sars-cov-2 could be reduced owing to differential transmission dynamics lower mask adherence or limited use of other personal protective equipment 63the review process had limitations in particular we used streamlined rapid review methods for searching and selecting studies we did not perform critical appraisal of observational studies by using a formal instrument though key methodological limitations were highlighted we included 1 nonpeer-reviewed study 21 which could reduce data quality meta-analysis was not attempted owing to study limitations and heterogeneity in study designs comparisons and analysesresearch is urgently needed to clarify the comparative effectiveness of masks for transmission of covid-19 in community and health care settings randomized trials are in progress 64 65 observational studies that prospectively measure mask use other infection prevention and control measures accounting for potential correlations and exposures could supplement randomized trials given limitations in the supply of n95 respirators understanding the effects of reuse or extended use of n95 respirators is a priority 66in conclusion evidence on the effectiveness of masks for prevention of respiratory infection is stronger in health care than community settings use of n95 respirators might reduce sars-cov-1 risk versus surgical masks in health care settings but applicability to sars-cov-2 is uncertainparticipants were recruited from amazons mechanical turk mturk on april 15 2020

 given that general compliance with regulations is high it is likely that the effects of messaging will be small using a cohens d of a small effect this would require 139 participants per experimental condition of which there are 3 however given that only about 13 of respondents on mturk identify as conservative i recruited 3 times that may participants to ensure enough conservatives per group this gives a total of 1251 respondents recruited to participate in this study i conducted a post data collection pre-analysis screening for bad ip addresses per kennedy et al 2018 which left a total of 1216 respondentsthe subject pool was typical of mturk samples age of participants ranged from 18 to 79 with a mean of 386 48 of the sample identified as female and 76 as white the sample was highly educated as 602 had a bachelors degree or higher and also skewed liberal with 543 identifying as liberal 172 as moderate and 285 as conservative after answering a brief series of demographics questions participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions  a control condition a prevention condition and a promotion conditionin the control condition individuals were presented with purely informational text about the cdcs mask recommendation in the prevention condition they were presented information that this recommendation will help prevent negative health and economic outcomes while in the promotion condition they were presented information that this recommendation will lead to positive health and economic outcomes the text of these treatments is belowcontrol

after reading this text individuals responded to four dependent measures measured on a seven-point scale ranging from strongly disagree 1 to strongly agree 7 the first is a behavioral intention question  i will wear a mask every time i leave my home the next two are attitudinal questions  it is best for society if everyone wears a mask when they leave their home and i dont think wearing a mask will impact the spread of the coronavirus a final question asking participants whether they would like to get more information about purchasing face masks was asked as a yes or no question to better get at behavior rather than behavioral intentionthese analyses follow a pre-analysis plan registered with open science framework osf at httpsosfiogbpnq recall that both hypotheses are conditional on ideology  promotion messages should work better with liberals and prevention messages better with conservatives three sets of analyses were pre-registered in this plansince rft predictions about ideology focus primarily on direction of ideology rather than strength choma busseri and sadava 2009 i first separate ideology between liberals and conservatives ideology was asked on the standard american national election study anes seven-point scale allowing respondents to select responses ranging from very conservative to very liberal with an option for respondents to select that they havent thought much about thisthose who report their ideology as moderatemiddle of the road or respond that they havent thought much about this are excluded from analysis respondents who answer very conservative conservative or somewhat conservative are coded as conservative while those who answer very liberal liberal or somewhat liberal will be coded as liberal this creates a dichotomous measure of ideology with individuals coded as either liberal 1 or conservative 0 this measure is then interacted with each of the treatments with the control group serving as reference of course rft provides relatively unclear predictions about how strength of ideology might impact the power of these types of messages on attitudes and behaviors as an additional set of analyses i interact the full ideological measure ranging from very conservative to very liberal with the treatments rather than the dichotomous measure this allows for the inclusion of ideological moderates in these analyses but still requires excluding those who do not place themselves on the ideological scaleas a last set of analyses i examine these relationships conditional on a match between a participants stated partisanship and the partisanship of their governor given that recent work finds that individuals are less likely to comply with measures when they do not share partisanship with their governor cornelson and miloucheva 2020 while there is little theory available to suggest that types of messages might interact with this it is an important exploratory analysis given the findings of cornelson and miloucheva 2020 which are directly related to covid-19 this will create a three-way interaction between the treatments respondent ideology and respondent co-partisanship with their states governor individual partisanship is based off of the standard two-pronged anes partisanship question including partisan leaners this is matched with an individuals self-reported state of residence and the partisanship of the current governor of that stategiven that this research design relies upon an observed moderator of ideology i include controls for observed covariates kam and trussler 2017  age gender race education and whether a respondent has a co-partisan governor or not since research shows this affects compliance with covid-19 related regulations cornelson and miloucheva 2020the results of the first set of analyses based on a binary ideological indicator are presented graphically in figure 1

 the results for a moderation by the seven-point ideological measure are available in figure 2 while the results for moderation by both ideology and gubernatorial co-partisanship are presented in figure 3 all regression models are available in the appendix supplementary material





as shown in figure 1 interesting though primarily null results emerge there are no differences between treatments for anyone on the intention to buy mask measure  individuals were equally likely across treatment groups and ideologies to request information on where to purchase a mask the behavioral intention variable however shows that the promotion message has an effect on desire to wear a mask however contrary to expectations this does not increase the willingness of liberals but decreases the willingness of conservatives to wear a mask relative to both the control and prevention message similar patterns emerge for the attitudinal measures  liberals are not affected significantly by the treatments but conservatives are less likely to see the benefit of masks and more likely to believe they will not impact the spread when exposed to the promotion message compared to the control and the prevention messagethese results are substantively similar though a bit more difficult to digest and less statistically precise the gap between treatments still tends to dampen for liberals and is larger for conservatives but does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance it appears however that the effect of messages is more conditional upon direction of ideology rather than strength as no major differences in treatment effects emerge for strong and slight conservativesthese results show little difference based on shared partisanship with ones governor for conservatives  regardless of partisanship of a conservative respondents governor they respond to the messages in similar fashion and the promotion message still seems to dampen their compliance with and favorability of the mask wearing measure for liberals however a different pattern emerges in line with expectations from rft when liberals are exposed to the promotion message their attitudes toward mask wearing change compared to the other messages dependent upon their governors partisanship liberals are more likely to believe that wearing masks is best for society and is less likely to believe that it will not impact the spread of coronavirus when exposed to the promotion message but only when their governor shares their partisanship these differences disappear when their governor does not share their partisanshipthese analyses find little support for how rft can inform our messaging about mask wearing during the covid-19 crisis while messages related to prevention seem to have no impact on behaviors and attitudes toward wearing facial masks regardless of individual ideology promotion related messages do have some impact though in unpredicted ways rft argues that liberals should be more receptive to promotion messages and i find some very limited support of this prediction respond positively to promotion messages under a specific condition  that they share partisanship with their states governor however the most consistent effects occur with conservatives showing less support for mask wearing when exposed to the promotion message  a finding not in line with predictions which predict that conservatives should not be affected differently by this message than the control messagewhy are prevention messages no more or less effective than a purely information message while this study is unable to examine the exact mechanism perhaps prevention messages simply do not work in this context official and unofficial messaging about the covid-19 crisis has heavily focused on prevention  flattening the curve is about stopping and slowing infections an inherently prevention focused message perhaps the focus on prevention messages in general has rendered additional information about prevention moot or perhaps individuals think of the mask wearing recommendation as prevention message by defaultin general this provides little support for targeting prevention and promotion messages based on ideology as rft would suggest related to mask wearing in response to the covid-19 crisis it seems that generally control messaging without a promotion or prevention cue and prevention messaging work equally well at promoting pro-mask attitudes and behaviors while a difference emerges related to promotion messaging it is unexpected and not in line with rft predictions serving to dampen support from conservatives further work should examine this unexpected finding to determine whether it is specifically related to the covid-19 crisis or if it broadly extends to how conservatives receive promotion focused messagesthis leaves policy recommendations a bit muddled  to the extent there is an impact it is that promotion messages make conservatives less complaint this suggests that a purely informational message without an additional prod may be the most effective strategy  since the evidence here provides little support for rft theories of ideological differences in response to messaging about mask wearing during the covid-19 crisis it is likely easiest to provide a straightforward messagethe covid-19 pandemic caused by the virus sars-cov-2 which first emerged in wuhan china in the province of huebei in december 2019 is posing a huge global health threat the total number of global deaths on the date of submitting this paper 24 april 2020 has risen to 191263 with 2717004 infected european centre for disease prevention and control 2020c the economic impact will be undoubtedly colossal and we are still unaware of the real consequences this will have on each countrys economy and on the labor market it is not the first pandemic that we have suffered but the dimensions of this one are especially shocking and only comparable to the flu pandemic of 1918 a little over a century ago it is certainly a public health threat that goes beyond occupational health and safety and it transgresses the borders of business organizations being of primary concern to virologists and epidemiologists but also to technicians specialists and academics in the field of safety who can make a significant contribution to its prevention in addition to the past and present research carried out to create detection tests vaccines antivirals and other treatments the main measures used in the health work and domestic spheres have focused on social distancing and lockdown as well as on the monitoring of safety protocols the adoption of hygiene measures and the use of personal protection equipment such as masks gloves etc this has meant that terms that were previously used by occupational health and safety professionals alone such as ffp2 ffp3 n95 kn95 etc have become part of the common language and have had a positive effect in the field of health and safety by popularizing and increasing the culture of prevention of society as a wholehowever we cannot forget the importance that the world health organization who has played in this context it initially made different recommendations for the groups including healthcare personnel people in direct contact with the infected and people with symptoms holland et al 2020 jansson et al 2020 on the one hand and for the rest of the people on the other while recommending the use of masks for the first three groups of people it did not do the same for individuals where it focused on measures of social distancing minimum interpersonal distance and personal hygiene more specifically the adequate washing of hands since airborne propagation was ruled out under normal conditions who 2020a to date although the who acknowledges that wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including covid-19 who 2020c it also says that however the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection and other measures should also be adopted therefore on 20 april 2020 it still recommends that if you are healthy you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with covid-19 who 2020b nevertheles it advises that each country apply a risk-based approach that is considering the benefits possibility of reducing the potential risk of exposure during the presymptomatic period as well as the potential risks self-contamination false sense of security impact on mask shortages when deciding whether to recommend the use of masks by the general population who 2020cin this sense the success of policies followed by countries such as south korea china and the czech republic regarding the use of masks from the very beginning in addition to other measures have demonstrated their benefits world economic forum 2020 news of this has spread through social networks and the media and has meant that the use of masks has become widespread in countries such as italy spain and others hit hard by the pandemic despite the fact that to date the who still does not explicitly recommend itthis has led to the european center for disease prevention and control european centre for disease prevention and control 2020a to recognize that the use of masks by the population could reduce the spread of the infection but it remembers that this should be a complementary measure to preventive hygiene measures likewise the centers for disease control and prevention 2020b centers for disease control and prevention 2020 recommends the use of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of covid-19 and the government of spain recommends the use of hygienic masks by the population ministry of health of spain 2020bthese circumstances together with the mass use of masks by health workers essential service companies cleaners supermarkets and other people in food supply security transport etc have caused a shortage leading the authorities in different countries to confiscate ppe and medical masks among other means that are used to fight the disease furthermore this situation is expected to persist for some time since the who itself estimates that approximately 89 million medical masks are needed each month to respond to covid-19 who 2020dthis is why governments hospitals companies and even individuals have also begun to look for solutions of all kinds including the reuse cleaning and disinfection of certified disposable masks either personal protection equipment or medical and the manufacture of homemade or non-certified ones european centre for disease prevention and control 2020a in addition at the time of submission of this paper a lockdown is in place in many countries around the world but once it is lifted a greater number of masks will be required to meet increasing needsconsequently prevention professionals companies and individuals from all over the world need to know how to disinfect and sterilize masks that in principle were designed manufactured and certified for short-term use and subsequent disposal and also to be aware of the effectiveness of homemade or non-certified ones thus in this publication we conducted a rapid review of scientific publications preprints protocols guides and other information available online with two objectives on the one hand to identify in the scientific literature the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks on the other hand to identify the main strategies for their disinfection andor sterilization as well as their advantages and disadvantages
table 1
presents a classification of the different types of disposable masks available according to the use for which they are intended such as personal protection equipment ppe or medical use likewise other types of masks have been included in the classification in order to obtain a complete overview of those that are currently being used due to the situation caused by covid-19 such as cloth hygienic homemade or non-medical masks this classification has been developed based on the definitions proposed by the european center for disease prevention and control european centre for disease prevention and control 2020a although it has been adapted to include new types of masks such as hygienic masks according to specification une 00642020 and une 00652020 recently developed by the spanish association for standardization une 2020a une 2020b une 2020 2020d these masks are intended for people or children without symptoms who are not susceptible to using surgical medical or ppefilter masks to protect them against particles in accordance with the restrictions established by the government of spain which currently recommends these latest types of masks for healthcare workers and people infected or with symptoms of covid-19 therefore table 1 focus on disposable mask such as ppe medical mask and others that can be single use non-reusable hygienic mask or some uses barrier mask reusable hygienic mask cloth mask reusable face mask respirators such as reusable half mask or full face mask that allow long-term use by changing their filters are not included in this classification see figure 3disposable filtering facepiece particulate respirators including reusable and disposable ones are personal protective equipment hereinafter ppe in european working environments and are regulated by regulation eu 2016425 of the european parliament and of the council of march 9 2016 on personal protective equipment and repealing council directive 89686eec european parliament and the council of the european union 2016 which obliges the manufacturer to apply the ce marking and to follow the procedure for evaluating and complying with the requirements for that marking specifically established in that directive see figure 1 figure 2 figure 3
 for this purpose the manufacturer will have a set of standards the main one being en 1492001 a12009 entitled respiratory protective devices filtering half mask to protect against particles requirements testing marking aenor 2010 additionally the manufacturer should abide by a series of standards among which the following should be highlighted en 132 1999 respiratory protective devices - definitions of terms and pictograms aenor 1999 en 134 1998 respiratory protective devices - nomenclature of components aenor 1998 en1432001 respiratory protective devices particle filters requirements testing marking aenor 2001 and en 13274-7 2008 respiratory protective devices  test methods - part 7 determination aenor 2008 this summary of standards will facilitate the presumed compliance of the manufacturer and will usually lead to the certification of the mask according to the standard there are also other countries outside europe with their own similar certification or homologation systems such as the united states 42 cfr 84 china gb2626-2006 south korea kmoel-2017-64 australianew zealand asnza 17162012 japan jmhlw-2000 etc see table 3 for example figure 4
shows a disposable n95 face mask according to 42 cfr 84 used in the united statesadditionally european healthcare systems use disposable medical or surgical masks which are not ppe but surgicalmedical apparatus and devices which are standardized by en 146832019ac2019 medical face masks - requirements and test methods une 2019 see figure 5
 as in the case of ppe there are also different certifications in other countries such as astm f2100-11 in the united states or yy 0469 in chinadue to the public health threat caused by sars-cov-2 there has been a lack of disposable masks certified to meet european technical standards in this situation the european commission published the commission recommendation eu 2020403 of march 13 2020 on conformity assessment and market surveillance procedures within the context of the covid-19 threat to allow as long as the shortage lasts the commercialization of ppe or medical devices that comply with non-european standards even if they do not have the ce marking who recommendations may be followed for their selection but an adequate level of protection must be guaranteed and the corresponding notifying authority immediately informed european commission 2020 similarly and subsequently on march 28 2020 and april 3 2020 food and drug administration 2020a food and drug administration 2020b the united states government published authorizations to import non-niosh-approved filtering facepiece respirators from other countries see table 3this situation of widespread shortages has led the civil society in different countries to dedicate itself to making all kinds of improvised facemasks without any guarantee of certification or homologation see figure 6
 initially individuals began to do this and the idea spread across social networks which resulted in misunderstandings and sometimes including intentional fakes or hoaxes by trolls thus individuals and even organizations began to prepare masks from different types of materials that allow users to cover their mouth and nose subsequently the authorities or institutions themselves have released their own documents to maximize the effectiveness of masks and minimize the negative impact of not being manufactured in accordance with the quality standards established by international standardization and certification bodiesfaced with this situation some standardization organizations began to develop reference documents in this regard it should be noted that at the end of march the french association for standardization published afnor spec s76-001 barrier masks guide to minimum requirements test methods manufacture and use for mass manufactured and homemade masks afnor 2020 however this document contains recommendations for design and use but does not allow conformity assessment by notified bodies or laboratories on the other hand the spanish association for standardization une published some key specifications to facilitate the manufacture of hygienic masks that if made under this specification would offer people protection against the covid-19 pandemic une 2020c 2020e in that way on april 2020 the specification une 0064 for non-reusable hygienic masks and the specification une 0065 for reusable hygienic masks were published the first is made up of two parts specification une 0064-1 non-reusable hygienic masks materials design manufacturing marking and usage requirements part 1 for adult use and specification une 0064-2 non-reusable hygienic masks materials design manufacturing marking and usage requirements part 2 for children use and establishes specifications for manufacture and use the second is made up of a single part specification une 0065 reusable hygienic masks for adults and children materials design manufacturing marking and use requirements une 2020d the interesting fact is that these specifications allow conformity assessment to be certified by a laboratory based on technical specifications une-en 146832019ac 2019 or another equivalent which offers greater guarantees to wearersthe advantage of hygienic masks compared to barrier masks is that the former have been tested following some of the procedures of en 146832019ac2019 achieving good results in the acceptance criteria for the effectiveness of bacterial filtration and breathability as explained in the next sectionthe development of this specification is positive due to the effect it may have on the availability of masks for the general population or rather people that are healthy or asymptomatic since many countries have begun to announce that they will require the use of masks despite the current shortage however it still takes time for hygienic masks to reach the population as it mentioned above on april 8 2020 the european centre for disease prevention and control recommended the use of masks by the population as a complementary preventive measure european centre for disease prevention and control 2020a and there are countries such as spain that recommend their use beginning april 13 2020 without sufficient stock to cover the entire population this is why improvised or community masks have become crucial and must be used with caution since their effectiveness has not been proventhe effectiveness of disposable masks is different depending on the type and certification standard in particular the en 1492001-a12010 standard aenor 2010 establishes 3 levels of protection depending on the leakage of all particles into the interior either through the adjustment of the mask to the face by the exhalation valve if any or penetration through the filter always measured according to the arithmetic measurement of the laboratory tests carried out by carriers these are22 for ffp18 for ffp22 for ffp3
in the case of the north american standard 42 cfr part 84 developed by niosh niosh 1995 nine types of filters are established composed of three levels of minimum filtration efficiency and three categories of resistance to the degrading effects of the oil at the workstation these resistance categories are n non-oil resistant r oil resistant and p oil-proof the levels of efficiency of filtration against aerosols have been determined considering a 03 m aerodynamic mass median diameter and these are95 for n95 r95 p9599 for n99 r99 p999997 for n100 r100 and p100
logically other regulations also establish their particular level of effectiveness table 2
below summarizes the ffp respirators that are recommended as ppe against covid-19 according to the standards of different countries food and drug administration 2020a food and drug administration 2020b it should therefore be noted that masks with an exhalation valve regardless of their level of effectiveness are not recommended as ppe against sars-cov-2 since exhaled air is released directly into the environment without any type of filtration and would favor the spreading of the coronavirus european centre for disease prevention and control 2020a ministry of health of spain 2020aregarding the effectiveness of surgical or medical masks the en 146832019ac2019 une 2019 standard establishes two types depending on their bacterial filtration efficiency and breathability in addition within type ii there are two categories depending on whether they are splash resistant or not as shown in table 3
 type i masks are only recommended for patients and other people including healthcare professionals to reduce the risk of spreading infectionthe effectiveness of homemade or cloth masks is unknown a priori as they are not manufactured according to a standard however in the case of hygienic masks abiding by the specifications une 0064 and une 0065 une 2020a une 2020b une 2020 2020d tests have been carried out and some of the operating requirements established in en 146832019ac2019 une 2019 have been analyzed the results are presented in table 4
although the effectiveness of the masks depends substantially on their correct use and they can often be overestimated garrigou et al 2020 it is especially interesting to know the comparative effectiveness of different types of masks assuming their correct use to determine the level of protection in each case in particular the bibliography regarding the comparative effectiveness of ppe-certified surgical and other masks has been reviewed belowthus in a hse study gawn et al 2008 compared in a laboratory the protection for airborne particles of surgical masks against ffp respirators and found the lowest level of respiratory protection in surgical masks against ffp respirators specifically they calculated a reduction factor for exposure to live aerosolized influenza virus as the ratio of the particle concentration inside and outside for each mask their results indicated that a properly adjusted ffp respirator can provide a mean reduction factor in exposure of 100 while a surgical mask would provide a mean reduction factor of 6 on the other hand lee et al 2008 have undertaken the task of comparing the n95 respirators and surgical masks against particles representing bacterial and viral size ranges as a result their study found that around 29 of n95 respirators and 100 of surgical masks had a protection factor 10 protection factor set by osha for that type of mask so they concluded that the n95s may not offer the expected protection level against bacteria and viruses however in 2016 we found the work of smith et al 2016 in which they compared the effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers from acute respiratory infection their study did not find sufficient evidence to uniquely determine that n95 respirators are superior to surgical masks as protection for healthcare workers against acute respiratory infections in clinical settings however they pointed out that in the laboratory setting the n95 respirators seemed to offer greater protection than the surgical masks a similar study was carried out by radonovich et al 2019 to compare the effect of n95 respirators vs surgical masks to protect healthcare workers against influenza and other viral respiratory infections they found no significant difference between the two masks in the incidence of influenza in the laboratory settingregarding the comparison with non-certified or homemade masks rengasamy et al 2010 carried out an evaluation of the filtration efficiency of this type of mask against particles to do this they tested these masks for 201000 nm size particles specifically polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols at two speeds since there are a wide variety of homemade masks with various characteristics they used the five main types made of sweatshirts t-shirts towels scarves and cloth in the test furthermore they compared the results with the penetration levels presented by n95 respirators their results indicated that these masks had 4090 instantaneous penetration levels at a low speed and between 9-98 at a higher speed subsequently macintyre et al 2015 compared the effectiveness of cloth mask vs medical mask in a hospital in this study 1607 healthcare workers participated who wore the masks for 4 weeks during their shifts in the hospital and performed procedures where aerosols are usually generated such as suctioning of airways sputum induction endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy their results indicate that the penetration of the medical mask by the particles was 44 while the penetration for the cloth mask was almost 97in addition to the above some organizations indicate that these improvised masks should be the last solution and for low-risk cases but that they can even increase the risk of infection due to humidity liquid diffusion and virus retention european centre for disease prevention and control 2020bto analyze reuse disinfection and sterilization we must differentiate between the different types of marks presented in table 1we must remember that either ppe -ffp respirators or medical face masks manufactured according to technical standards require that they be discarded after use since they are heat sensitive and are not designed to undergo a process as severe as sterilization rowan and laffey 2020 this is why manufacturers like 3m initially advised against the sterilization process 3m 2020a however due to the shortage of these masks caused by the covid-19 crisis manufacturers including 3m governments and related agencies and institutions began to analyze the reuse disinfection or sterilization of ppe  ffp respiratorsas far as reuse of ppe is concerned the first thing to know is how long the sars-cov-2 remains on surfaces kampf et al 2020 analyzed 22 studies focused on this question and studied different human coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses hcov they concluded that human coronaviruses remain on inanimate surfaces such as metal wood paper glass or plastic for up to 9 days but they can be efficiently inactivated through disinfection with 6271 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute of exposure however it is important to note that none of the studies analyzed by kampf et al 2020 focused specifically on sars-cov-2 and that only one of them showed 9-day persistence of the coronavirus all the others indicated 5 days at most in another recent study tests were conducted with the sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 in aerosols and on various surfaces their results indicate that sars-cov-2 remains on plastic stainless steel copper and cardboard surfaces for up to 72 hours van doremalen et al 2020based on this study and given the need to reuse ffp respirators the us government has recommended that each healthcare worker receives five ffp respirators and uses one per day in a specific order at the end of the workday the ffp respirator must be kept in a breathable paper bag and stored by order of use if the worker stores and uses their ffp respirators in order each day a minimum of five days between the use of each ffp respirator elapses centers for disease control and prevention 2020a however these recommendations should be treated with caution since ffp respirators are designed for single-use and could be damaged lose some of their properties and become ineffective as a barrier against contagion furthermore due to the aforementioned shortage five ffp respirators may not be available per healthcare worker therefore it is necessary to study disinfection or sterilization methodsin this regard it should be noted that any method used for the disinfection of ffp respirators must guarantee effectiveness against covid-19 that the mask is not damaged in terms of the adjustment to the face or its filtration capacity and that it is not harmful to the person wearing the respirator 3m 2020b therefore governments manufacturers scientists or experts in the field are working towards finding the most effective method for disinfecting ffp respirators against covid-19under these premises multiple potential methods for disinfection and sterilization have begun to be studied some based on chemical methods such as the use of h2o2 hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide bleach alcohol soap solutions ethylene oxide ozone decontamination etc and physical methods such as the use of heat with steam or with dry air uv rays gamma irradiation microwave etc mohapatra s 2017 although strict follow-up of procedures is undoubtedly of vital importance and this is not always the case bessesen et al 2015like all respiratory equipment used for protection against particles filtering ffp2 respirators are thermally tested for their marking and certification which entails subjecting the equipment to 70c for 24 hours followed by another 24 hours at 30c ministry of labor and social economy 2020 it therefore appears that this method is of singular importance therefore song et al 2020 carried out a study on ffp respirators but with the flu virus and used an oven for 30 minutes at 56c as well as hot air from a hair dryer for 30 minutes these researchers obtained total inactivation in the case of the dryer and partial inactivation of the virus in the case of the oven without affecting filtering capacity based on this both the spanish ministry of labor and social economy 2020 and the international medical center of beijing 2020 indicate that ffp respirators maintain their filtration efficiency after being disinfected at 70c for 30 minutes although no effects on the fit or deformation are mentioned according to n95decon 2020d it could be pointed out as an advantage that under these conditions heat inactivates related coronavirus although the disadvantage is that there are no data confirming that sars-cov-2 is inactivated with dry heat and several decontamination cycles could lead to the degradation of the effectiveness of the filtration or the fit in this way spanish society of preventive medicine public health and hygiene 2020 recommends as a method of decontamination for ffp respirators dry heat 70c for 30 minutes in a convection oven to guarantee constant and uniform temperature maintenance likewise price and chu 2020 recommend disinfection under those same conditions and they add that it could be done for 20 cyclesregarding decontamination of ffp respirators by ozone zhang et al 2004 studied the inactivation of the sars-cov-1 by applying different concentrations of ozone solution disinfectant they found that this virus could be inactivated using a high concentration of 2773 mgl for 4 min dennis et al 2020 conducted another study where they analyzed the scientific literature available in this regard and concluded that the existing findings in other studies seem to support that ozone inactivates viruses by attacking capsid proteins they proposed a decontamination method using ozone to inactivate sars-cov-2 thus they performed different experiments in two ozone decontamination boxes based on this they proposed practical recommendations to implement a simple disinfection box system using inexpensive and readily available components that could be used for ffp respirators the ozone concentrations required are 10 to 20 ppm with an exposure for at least 10 minutes they noted that it is an improvised solution for situations of need such as the covid-19 pandemic but not an optimal long-term solution among the advantages of ozone gas they indicated that its virucidal action is faster than the degradation effect of the ffp respirator which is effective for disinfecting fibrous materials as it is a dry virucidal and that it reaches shadows and crevices in the process disinfection unlike ultraviolet radiation as will be seen laterother methods that seem promising are vaporized hydrogen peroxide low temperature moist heat and ultraviolet c radiation 3m 2020b centers for disease control and prevention 2020a n95decon 2020a firstly regarding the use of ultraviolet uv radiation jinadatha et al 2015 studied disinfecting ppe prior to doffing by applying pulsed xenon ultraviolet px-uv on glass carriers and ppe material contaminated with an ebola surrogate virus as a result the viral load on both glass carriers and ppe materials decreased after exposure to px-uv numerous studies are therefore currently being carried out to determine its effectiveness for decontamination against the coronavirus ohearn et al 2020 have developed a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of ffp respiratorsn95 after decontamination with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi they have analyzed 13 papers and have concluded that the filtering effectiveness of ffp respirator is maintained after a uvgi cycle and they propose the use of a cumulative uv-c dose of 40000 jm2 in future research to validate this promising method likewise they have indicated that it will be necessary to carry out fit tests moreover card et al 2020 analyzed the possibility of using biosafety cabinets for the decontamination of ffp respirators n95 by ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi for this purpose they tested the uv-c radiation in two randomly chosen idle biosafety cabinets in which they measured the minimum intensity and obtained a factor of 171 and 198 less than the maximums of each biosafety cabinet respectively based on the maximum observed ratio 198 they estimated the sterilization time for ffp respirators n95 in a biosafety cabinet finally they developed a protocol to disinfect an ffp respirator after irradiating it for 15-20 minutes per side with a fluence of 100 wcm-2 per manufacturers recordsrecently another report also focusing on the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi on ffp respirators n95 has been published online by nebrasca medicine lowe et al 2020 they demonstrated that uvgi is effective in inactivating a large number of human pathogens including coronaviruses and that if uvgi is applied on ffp respirators n95 these pathogens are inactivated likewise the necessary levels of uvgi do not affect the fit and filtering effectiveness of the ffp respirators and can be safely administered after providing adequate safeguards according to them hamzavi et al 2020 recommend its use for the inactivation of sars-cov-2 due to the shortage of ffp respirators highlighting that uvgi does not degrade the polymers thus there are already other organizations that recommend this protocol proposed by nebrasca medicine as a decontamination method n95decon 2020e similarly spanish society of preventive medicine public health and hygiene 2020 includes among the recommended decontamination methods for ffp respirators the uvgi with double lamp up and down 36w and exposure time of 148 seconds they indicate an effectiveness of bacterial disinfection with 7log reduction and harmlessness on respiratorshowever it must be considered that the effectiveness of uv depends on the dose or fluence and shading since it only inactivates by irradiating surfaces the ffp respirators must thus be irradiated from both sides rowan and laffey 2020 the international medical center of beijing 2020 indicates that uv disinfection does not affect the filtration levels of the ffp respirators although it does not recommend its use because the inactivation effect it produces on ffp respirator fibers is unknownthis has given rise to uncertainty about the actual decontamination capacity in the inner layers of the ffp respirators thus the centers for disease control and prevention 2020a warns that uvgi is unlikely to kill all the viruses and bacteria on an filtering facepiece respirator due to shadow effects produced by the multiple layers of the filtering facepiece respiratos construction therefore it would be necessary to develop methods or procedures that can eliminate this uncertainty in this regard fisher and shaffer 2011 established a method to evaluate decontamination of inner layers of ffp respirators n95 using ultraviolet-c therefore based on this study a standard procedure could be established to evaluate the effectiveness of uvgi in the inner layers and confirm or rule out its possible use for the inactivation of the coronavirus in ffp respiratorsthe use of ultraviolet radiation is currently being evaluated by 3m with a 254 mm uv lamp for its possible use as an ffp respirator decontamination method during the covid-19 pandemic however the evaluations have not yet been completed nor has its use been authorized by the fda 3m 2020b according to n95decon 2020c n95decon 2020c the advantages of this could be that 1 jcm of uv-c inactivates viruses similar to sars-cov-2 on n95s and the n95 maintains fit and filter performance after 10-20 cycles of 112 jcm uv-c and the disadvantages are that uv-c may not reach the inner layer of the ffp respirator shadows may appear giving rise to parts of the ffp respirator that have not been decontaminated straps may not be completely decontaminated the strap and facepiece may be damaged after uv-c and at high uv-c doses 120 jcm the n95 can be damagedon the other hand  the use of hydrogen peroxide or h2o2 has also been recently evaluated although there were already previous studies such as that carried out by battelle an fda contractor which analyzed the decontamination and reuse of ffp respirators n95 using hydrogen peroxide vapor hpv and the bioquell clarus c system in this study only the efficacy of disinfection for the inactivation of g stearothermophilus spores was verified they specifically demonstrated that they had achieved a 6-log reduction in organism and that inactivation continued to occur in up to 50 decontamination cycles regarding mechanical integrity and performance in up to 50 cycles the filtration capacity was maintained but the adjustability was affected because the strap became degraded after 10 to 20 cycles and broke after 30 cycles the recommended wash cycle was 480 minutes in this way they demonstrated that this process was feasible to decontaminate large amounts of ffp respirators simultaneously up to 50 cycles with hydrogen peroxide vapor since the filtration requirements of ffp respirators were maintained although they recommended studying alternative materials for the straps or studying other models of ffp respirators battelle 2016actually based on this study schwartz et al 2020 have performed validation tests on hydrogen peroxide vapor hpv to decontaminate ffp respirators n95 using the bioquell 61 clarus c system with a 35 hydrogen peroxide solution for the time recommended by battelle 2016 they have validated the method and point out that ffp respirators retain their filtering effectiveness after 50 cycles in the laboratory in addition they performed fit tests and the results indicate that no loss of fit occurred therefore they say that they are going to start using this decontamination process which has been internally validated and approved by the duke institutional biosafety review committee ibrcit is important to note that on march 29 2020 the fda issued an emergency use authorization usa for the emergency use of the battelle ccds critical care decontamination system at the battelle memorial institute for decontaminating n95 ffp respirators or the equivalent for reuse by health personnel during the covid-19 pandemic for a maximum of 20 ffp respirators decontamination cycles food and drug administration 2020d subsequently on april 2020 the fda also authorized the use of steris v-pro 1 plus max and max2 low temperature sterilization systems and sterrad 100s nx and 100nx sterilization systems for the same purpose and for a maximum of 10 and 2 decontamination cycles per ffp respirator respectively food and drug administration 2020e 2020 f all these systems use vaporized hydrogen peroxide vhp which is the only fda-authorized decontamination method to date likewise spanish society of preventive medicine public health and hygiene 2020 recommends the use of low-pressure vaporized hydrogen peroxide for the decontamination of ffp respirators except those containing cellulose and may only be reprocessed a maximum of 2 timessimilar conclusions regarding hydrogen peroxide vapor have been established by the dutch national institute of public health and the environment rivm through a pilot study carried out with matachana hydrogen peroxide sterilizers this study has confirmed that hydrogen peroxide sterilization is a valid reprocessing method for ffp respirators ffp2 in order to inactive coronavirus to reach this conclusion unused ffp respirators were reprocessed by applying different types of processes such as cleaning and drying with and without detergent or chemical disinfection vaporized hydrogen peroxide low pressure gas sterilization applied at different times and steam sterilization subsequently ffp respirators were subjected to a fit test to verify that they fit properly and that the filter material continued to be a good barrier against particles the fit test results for an untreated ffp respirator showed an average value of 162 therefore a reprocessed ffp respirator must have a minimum average value of 100 to pass the fit test the results are presented in table 5
 based on these it was preliminarily concluded that double sterilization using a short process with hydrogen peroxide gives an acceptable result dutch national institute for public health and the environment 2020the use of ethylene oxide which is widespread in hospitals is less safe than hydrogen peroxide vaporization and less environmentally friendly research seems to confirm that the coronavirus is highly affected by vaporization of hydrogen peroxide which is lethal with a concentration of 05 in less than one minute rowan and laffey 2020 according to n95decon 2020b the advantages of hydrogen peroxide vapor vhp are that it inactivates the coronavirus and that after 20 cycles it does not degrade the effectiveness of the filter fit or strapsother study was also found that analyzed the use of hydrogen peroxide as plasma gas hpgp for disinfection the results showed that out of the six models of ffp respirators analyzed four of them demonstrated mean penetration levels of less than 5 however this has not been tested for the specific case of sars-cov-2 bergman et al 2010 according to n95decon 2020b a low dose hpgp for 2 cycles does not degrade fit for 3m 8822 n95s and a high dose reduces ffp respirator filtrationalso moist heat has been proposed as a decontamination method this is a process based on applying heat and humidity to the ffp respirators there are different studies that address this method for the disinfection of ffp respirators 3m 2020b bergman et al 2010 bergman et al 2011 heimbuch et al 2011 lore et al 2012 viscussi et al 2011 among them the study carried out by 3m is the only one that specifically focuses on the inactivation of sars-cov-2 they used an environment chamber and introduced each ffp respirator in a high temperature self-seal pouch a temperature of 65  5c and 50-80 relative humidity were used for 30 min they tested up to 10 reprocessing cycles and both the filtration efficiency and the fit were maintained although 3m indicates that they are still working to obtain from the us food and drug administration issue an emergency use authorization for decontamination of ffp respirators of sars-cov-2 3m 2020bin relation to other disinfection or decontamination methods that could be used for sars-voc-2the use of powdered alcohol another traditional disinfectant does not seem to be recommended since it eliminates the electrostatic retention of the mask fibers reducing filtration capacity by 95 international medical center of beijing 2020 ministry of labor and social economy 2020 additionally washing with soapy water can also affect the electrostatic properties of the fibers or even deform the mask ministry of labor and social economy 2020regarding the use of gamma radiation and based on previous studies the european center for disease prevention and control 2020 indicated that coronaviruses are inactivated with a gamma radiation dose of 20kgy 2mrad however possible deformations appear with a dose of 24kgy on the ffp respirator and therefore the inner filtering layer and the fit are compromised fedmann et al 2019as for steam sterilization like the dutch national institute for public health and the environment 2020 of the dutch ministry of health welfare and sport the international medical center of beijing 2020 indicates on its website that there is a reduction in the efficiency of ffp respirators to below 95 and serious deformation when subjected to the steamer damp heat method with high pressure and high temperature nevertheless a study by stafondford medicine price and chu 2020 indicates that hot water steam could be used for 3 treatment cycles or less while maintaining a filtration efficiency of 95 but for a greater number of cycles they found that the filtration efficiency was affected based on this spanish society of preventive medicine public health and hygiene 2020 indicates that water vapor could be used to cycle at 65c for 30 minutes for decontamination of ffp respiratorthere are even those who need an alternative disinfection method and propose a two-step process to maximize the effectiveness thus derraik et al 2020 propose to store the ffp respirators for 4 or more days and then subject them to a disinfection process using ultraviolet light uvc dry heat treatment or chemical disinfection although the efficiency of these has not been provensummarizing there seems to be a more or less generalized consensus on some methods that are not recommended for disinfection or sterilization such as cleaning with soapy water alcohol bleach immersion ethylene oxide ionizing radiation microwave high temperature autoclave or steam because they can significantly degrade the filter either because they alter the electrostatic properties of the filter fibers affect particle penetration levels or deform the ffp respirator leading to ffp respirator degradation 3m 2020b centers for disease control and prevention 2020a n95decon 2020a viscusi et al 2007 viscusi et al 2009masks that are not ppe medical or surgical such as the spanish reutilizable hygienic mask or the french barrier mask there are detailed instructions for machine washing in the first case specification une 00652020 une 2020d recommends washing the hygienic mask in the washing machine through a complete cycle of washing at 60c with the usual detergent and afterwards it must be completely dried for 2 h after washing next the hygienic mask must be visually checked minor adjustment deformation wear and if its degradation is detected it must be discarded in the second case afnor spec s76-001 afnor 2020 recommends that before washing the barrier mask the empty washing machine should be cleaned using a cold rinse with bleach or by turning it to 60 or 95c without spinning the washing cycle must be equal to or longer than 30 minutes at 60c the use of regular detergents is recommended as for drying it is recommended to use the dryer for two hours and then clean its filters once the barrier mask is completely dry the fit should be checkedin the case of the spanish non-reusable hygienic mask according to specification une 0064 une 2020a une 2020b une 2020 a maximum use of 4 hours is recommended unless the mask becomes previously degraded or humid therefore washing or disinfecting are not recommendedin relation to homemade masks cloth face coverings or non-certified masks the centers for disease control and prevention 2020b centers for disease control and prevention 2020 indicate that these can be washed in the washing machine although no specific washing instructions are providedfinally it must be considered that many of these studies and tests presented are carried out with a specific type andor model of mask therefore it is necessary to be cautious since they can have different effects on other models or types of masks and reduce their effectiveness or affect the properties of the mask or even the strapsalthough technical standards are the main reference that should be used as a guide to the manufacture and use of personal protective equipment such as disposable masks in situations of extreme scarcity caused by epidemics and in this particular case the covid 19 pandemic other strategies should be considered among them the reuse of disposable filtering facepiece respirators does not seem like a bad transitional solution until the shortage is over among the different methods the available literature seems to point out that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor ultraviolet radiation moist heat dry heat and ozone gas within them hydrogen peroxide vapor treatment appears to be the best system and is being widely recommended although ultraviolet reduction has also been recommended in some countries there are those who point to doubts about its effectiveness in the inner layers due to shadows dry heat also appears to be effective although it has not been widely recommended there is even a study that points out the effectiveness of dry heat using a hair dryer for disinfection the moist heat is currently being evaluated to verify that it does not degrade the fit or the filtration capacity ozone gas appears to be effective in decontaminating ffp respirators without damaging them although it presents risks for the safety and health of workers who carry out the process if it is not handled properlyother decontamination procedures allow reuse for a limited number of times and with certain limitations and negative side effects including the deformation of the elastic the metal strip to fasten it to the face or the possibility of causing the accumulation of humidity with the consequent risk of exposure to the virus and self-infectionin addition to effectiveness other variables may influence the selection of one or another decontamination method by organizations hospitals or companies that need to apply them to guarantee the supply of ppe during the covid-19 pandemic in fact some methods require specific technology or resources that make the decontamination process more expensive in this sense dry heat seems to be cheap another factor to consider would be that the method chosen for disinfection must be adapted to the needs of the companies in terms of time and amounts of decontaminated ffp respirators they must also be logistically and organizationally viable even it can take into account other issues such as the traceability of the process or the confidence that is generated in the workers who must reuse the ffp respiratorsfurthermore surgical masks compared to personal protection equipment have a similar effectiveness and are therefore a good alternative disinfection processes for reuse have not been described for this type of masks the hygienic mask offers a lower level of protection than the previous ones however in the case of recommending the use of mask by the uninfected and asymptomatic population during the shortage of personal protection equipment and surgical masks hygienic masks seem the best option since they are certified according to a specificationfinally improvised homemade or non-certified masks are the worst alternative of those studied although it seems better than using nothing at all however some bodies say that they may even increase the risk of infection due to humidity the diffusion of liquids and the retention of the virus in the mask which would facilitate self-infection the washing machine and dryer should be used for decontamination

january 20 2020 by the world health organization and a public health emergency by the us on january 31 2020 a total of 463412 cases worldwide and 20912 deaths till now 1 amongst the currently infected patients 328698 a total of 314319 96 have mild condition and 14379 4 are serious or critical amongst the closed cases of 134714 the mortality was in 20912 16 1 the early reported mortality rate of 43 2 appears to be lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome but this initial figure is believed likely to be an underestimation as most of the confirmed patients are still inpatients and their condition is not yet resolved common symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath muscle pain sputum production diarrhea and sore throat are less common 3 while the majority of cases result in mild symptoms some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure 4based on current evidence it is speculated that respiratory droplets and possibly feco-oral routes are culprits for the mode of transmission similar to the sars epidemic in 2003 5 6 with the outbreak of covid 19 there has been redistribution of manpower and resources to critically meet the current and anticipated hospital service needs due to total lockdown announced in our country the patients availing the medical help for minor ailments has been reduced considerably also all the elective surgical procedures have been postponed for a month or so as to avoid unnecessary overcrowding and possible exposure and spread of coronavirus there has also been a reduction in elective clinics and operations to mobilize manpower to acute specialties combatting the outbreak and maximize hospital beds numbers available in anticipation of the outbreak there is also understandably fear from the public in visiting hospitalscoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 it has taken a lot of lives since its outbreak this outbreak has additionally seen a high morbidity among healthcare workers much like previous outbreaks of human coronavirus the first fatality of a physician documented globally was that of an otolaryngology physician in wuhan on january 25 2020 whose situation was similar to that of an otolaryngologist who died of sars in 2003 thus it is important that otolaryngologists and physicians globally stay abreast of this outbreak and realise the need for essential precautionary practices that are potentially crucial in protecting themselves and patients during this epidemic in many regions globally it is a very common practice for patients with upper respiratory tract infections to seek family practitioners and otolaryngologists as a primary care physician such a practice inadvertently poses inherent potentiall risks for physicians examining patients potentially carrying the virusconsidering the pandemic outbreak of covid 19 and its virility at present there is no vaccine or any other treatment for this deadly virus infection prevention at present is an appropriate control measure in addition to other measure like hand hygiene personal protective equipment ppe and waste management materialsan area of particular concern for use of personal protective equipment ppe in otolaryngolgy field is aerosol-generating procedures that would include open systems for tracheostomies and possibly the performance of flexible laryngoscopy the protective equipment consists of garments placed to protect the health care workers or any other persons to get infected personal protective equipment ppe is most important in preventing transmission of the virus these usually consist of standard precautionary measures like gloves mask and gown for blood or airborne high infections it includes face protection goggles and mask or face shield gloves gown or coverall head cover rubber bootswith the current covid-19 outbreak in our country and our region of maharashtra india all outpatient clinic patients are seen by otolaryngologists and physicians wearing minimum an n95 mask and gloves considering the situation in developing countries like ours there is economic burden of providing the ppe to all the health care professionals including doctors nursing staff supporting staff icu technicians laboratory technicians law handling forces police and soldiers who manage the mobs during the lockdown infected and non-infected patients and their relatives its a tremendous health care burden protecting all these key people who are prone to risk of exposure we need simple solutions and it is the responsibility of the government to take care of all the people at risk so finding a simple economical solution is a must in all the developing countries and to provide the safety protection equipment to one and all to prevent the spread of covid 19 in our country with a large population supplying ppe to all the health care workers of all hospitals definitely is an economic burden there is need for cheap disposable face masks eye protection gloves and gowns enough safety gear for medical workers sick people and for the public procurement of such large amount of protection wear is difficult as it runs out of stock due to high demands there is a tremendous need that the masks and the protection wear to be prepared by the health workers for self-protection with a continuous and constant contemplation we have come up with a solution which is economic simple solution as well as easily prepared we have designed a face mask which will cover not only nose and mouth but also the whole of the face thereby preventing the exposure to the eyes nose mouth and facewe recommend a very economical face protection mask as a safety barrier to prevent contactexposure to the corona virus it would be a better alternative other than no protection at all it will definitely save many lives of the health care workers working selflessly for the community during the covid 19 pandemicwe propose the use of a4 size ohp transparency plastic slide and a regular cloth mask or disposable mask for it it can be prepared by dividing

solution for minimum of 10 minstrictly no autoclavethe mode of transmission is by respiratory droplets and by feco-oral route the respiratory droplet transmission is very rapid if no barrier is present it can be prevented by the use of masks with the ongoing pandemic there is an extreme shortage of masks not only in developing countries but also in the affluent developed countries with a demand and supply mismatch with the disposable masks available in the market are running out of stock as the demand is more of such masks as a result of which the health care workers exposed to the suspectedpotential covid 19 patients are deprived of even masks in such situations the ppe is definitely out of question under these circumstances it is of immense importance that the health care workers use at least some sort of protection or a barrier and thus prevent exposure and thus the risks our mask though a simple one definitely serves as a protection and effective barrier than no protection at all it can be used in adjunct with the n95 mask or a simple disposable mask or a simple double folded polyester cloth mask such masks can be prepared by the hospital staff within the hospital itself and can be sterilised too as mentioned in quantity as required by the staff so it wouldnt increase the burden on the economy of the country and makes the health care workers self-sufficient it obviates the need for additional eye wear by the health care workers it can also be supplemented by the wearing of disposable gowns as an additional protectionwith the extreme shortage of the n95 masks and other disposable masks our simple and economic option for preparing our own effective barrier face masks and face shields by use of ohp transparent sheet and the routine

 wearing face masks protects yourself and others use of face masks is therefore likely to play a vital role in mitigating disease spread

17 which made early detection challenging epidemiological evidence shows that 2019-ncov can be transmitted from person to person among close contacts possibly through respiratory droplets the acute respiratory infection has an incubation period of 214 days before any symptoms show preliminary data report 11 lethality among hospitalized patients16 at the time of this manuscripts authorship there was no specific medicine or vaccine for coronavirus 2019-ncov17

18 according to the cases identified in macau the impact of 2019-cov on human health appears to be mild and the first patient with the confirmed diagnosis had full recovery and been discharged on february 6 202019
such information is important for community pharmacist to know convey and employ being able to address the public enquires with accurate up-to-date information about the local situation and the overall infection progress is the key to build trustful relationship with them at troubled times this will in turn improve the outcomes of educating the public about the preventative measures of the 2019-cov outbreak and the early recognition of symptoms as fip suggested community pharmacies in outbreak-affected and unaffected countries are often the first point of contact with the health system for those with health-related concerns or simply in need of information and reliable advice 8
pharmacists like any other health professionals are responsible for providing safe and ethical care to the public in accordance to the professional standards at all times implementation of infection prevention and control practices in the community pharmacy can help both staff and customers feel safe and at ease inside the premise more importantly it is critical for ensuring personal safety reducing the risks of transmitting the virus between people and preventing the spread of infection through contacts of items in the pharmacy for this pharmacy managers will need to ensure the correct and regular practice of hand hygiene among all staff members and to ensure all the necessary facilities are installed and hand hygiene products readily available for use20 additionally regular cleaning of surfaces and items will also help to eliminate the potential sources for spread of infection21 pharmacy staff should be encouraged to educate all customers about hand hygiene infection prevention and control strategies as instructed by the government all these preventative measures at the community pharmacies were exceptionally important for pharmacies visited not only by local residents but also tourists from around the world similarly the personal and environmental practice by the public should be reinforced whenever possible and community pharmacists are well-positioned to do so more than any other health professionalsroutine hand hygiene is essential for preventing the spread of the virus and requires the correct use of alcohol-based formulation21 however community pharmacists encountered a major issue soon after the news about the potential spread of 2019-cov to the city  a foreseeable short supply of hand hygiene products which were all imported products community pharmacy is often one of the major retail outlet of such products and is expected to play the important role of ensuring the availability of such products in the pharmacy ever since the first diagnosis of 2019-cov the supply of various disinfection products such as alcohol alcohol hand rub and disinfectant has been tight the over-reliance on importation exposed the public health to substantial vulnerability community pharmacists continued to seek new product sources but without success on february 7 2020 the local government stepped in and commissioned two local pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce disinfectant products22 on reflection instead of being less than proactive community pharmacists could have taken steps to try to prepare alcohol-based handrub formulations some of them indicated the lack of knowledge and therefore lack of confidence to do so the underlying problem was indeed the lack of knowledge about where to locate reliable instructions of preparing such formulations a step-by-step guide for production of handrub formulations at pharmacy bench had been provided by the who23 and re-iterated in the annex 4 of the fip guideline8 it is important for community pharmacists to get familiarized with the procedure and to ensure all the necessary reagents and devices are available in the pharmacyone of the most unforgettable lessons learnt from the sars outbreak was that wearing a mask could offer protection against sars and other viral infections alike24 according to the who wearing a surgical mask in combination with hand hygiene and other preventative measures is one of the prevention measures to limit the spread of 2019- ncov in affected areas25 more importantly stable accessibility of this protective gear was considered a key to stability in the society this posed another vulnerability for the city as the supply of surgical mask totally relied on external sources on this matter community pharmacists in macau were positioned to do three things 1 help consumers differentiate surgical masks from other types of face masks not made for protection against virus transmission 2 control the price of surgical masks within reasonable price range and 3 help implement the guaranteed mask supply for macao residents scheme in response to the new government policymany types of face masks are available in the local market and online misinformed choice of face masks that are not designed to offer protection against viral transmission would cause a false sense of security and hamper the defense mechanism at the society level unlike ordinary face masks surgical masks were required to demonstrate their performance in terms of bacterial filtration efficiency differential pressure resistance to penetration by synthetic blood sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency andor flammability as stipulated in the who guideline and national standards26 27 28 the spreading of the new coronavirus infection inevitably drove demands for protective masks and community pharmacists should play a reliable gatekeeper in advising about the right choice and stocking the appropriate surgical masks for the intended purposes in addition by selling the surgical masks within the reasonable price range the community pharmacies set the reference price which could help counteract irrational pricing elsewhere pharmacists self-conscious about upholding ethical and professional responsibilities towards the safety of the community was evident across the community setting and should be continually encouragedone of the policies the government put in place to allay fears of surgical mask shortage and dissuade people of the need to stockpile supplies was the the guaranteed mask supply for macao residents scheme in which community pharmacy played a key role in the smooth implementation after the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the city on january 22 2020 the local government ordered 20 million masks and announced a controlled distribution through pharmacies29 according to the scheme each local resident and person on working visa could buy a maximum of 10 surgical masks every 10 days for only 8 patacas us1 at contracted pharmacies as long as they presented their valid identity card moreover the government had set up a webpage with updates every 15 minutes of the number of surgical masks available at different pharmacies and their contact details for the convenience of the buyers30 this scheme was feasible due to the preexisting partnership between the government and the participating pharmacies fifty-six of the 294 community pharmacies in macau joined the public-private partnership and became the contracted pharmacies to share the dispensing duties and pharmaceutical care for patients from the public health institutes long before the outbreak in order to monitor the pharmacy stock take of pharmaceutical products as required in the partnership agreement an it system was installed so that the data about the purchase and sales of those pharmaceutical products were collected during each transaction at the pharmacy and immediately submitted to the central data system in the government for real-time monitoring purposes with this system already in place before the 2019-cov outbreak only minor adjustment was needed to include government-provided surgical masks on the monitoring list and make such information publicly available on the official website while the community pharmacies were the components of this the guaranteed mask supply for macao residents scheme and the it system being the infrastructure it was really the data that ensured the connectivity of the system for it to run smoothly and serve the purpose community pharmacists therefore played the role of custodian in data availability and accuracyall the imported cases of 2019-cov infection in macau were residents from wuhan who fell ill during their stay in macau considering the possibility of human-to-human transmission and the continuous growth of outbreak the high volume of travel from wuhan was considered a major threat to the effectiveness of infection prevention and control reinforcement of health inspection and isolation efforts at various cross-boundary checkpoints mandatory requirements for all travelers from wuhan to declare their health status and tighter border-control took place immediately while these measures aimed to step up the respiratory-disease-surveillance system the potential risks of carrying and transmitting the virus by the wuhan travelers who were still staying in macau could not be dismissed early detection and referral of suspected cases were crucial to prevent large-scale community transmission as mentioned above the early symptoms could be mild and non-specific15

16 and community pharmacy could well be the first point of contact when the affected people sought basic medical aid for symptomatic relief community pharmacists therefore must be on full alert and be able to screen patients for any necessary referral the guide for the evaluation of patients under investigation for 2019-ncov recommended provided by the us cdc was included in the fip guideline and community pharmacists should become familiar with the criteria recommended8
community pharmacists have a key role in preventing the spread of 2019-cov virus they are charged with key responsibilities of informing advising and educating the community maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products and screening of suspected cases and making appropriate referral as required as this or similar situations evolve community pharmacists should remain engaged in the coordinated efforts and be readily adaptive to changes required in pharmacy practice for pharmacists to assume a role in the health emergency preparedness and response arrangements at community level public private partnership and the application of real-world data have been shown to be vitalwhat is the effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks versus cloth masks for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in addition to standard precautions gloves  handwashing in community settingswhat is the effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks versus cloth masks for the prevention of covid-19 in addition to standard precautions gowns  gloves  handwashing in health care settingswhat is the effectiveness for reuse or extended use of n95 respirators for prevention of covid-19severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 spreads among persons in close proximity through droplets although evidence is still emerging regarding potential airborne transmission reducing transmission of sars-cov-2 infection in health care and community settings is a major priority especially in the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment the use of respiratory personal protective equipment ppe may decrease the risk for respiratory infection although controversy exists around the appropriate types of masks and the situations in which they should be used in community and health care settings for the prevention of sars-cov-2 infection the following practice points table 1 are intended for clinicians patients and the public data on sars-cov-2 are limited these practice points are based on the best available evidence on the effectiveness of n95 respirators surgical masks and cloth masks in reducing

what is the effectiveness of n95 respirators surgical masks and cloth masks for the prevention of covid-19 in addition to standard precautions gloves  handwashing in community settings
the goal of using n95 respirators surgical masks or cloth masks is to prevent transmission of sars-cov-2 infection from asymptomatic or symptomatic infected persons to uninfected persons source control currently no direct evidence exists for the effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of various types of respirators or masks for preventing sars-cov-2 infection in community settings low-certainty evidence showed that mask use may reduce the risk for sars-cov-1 infection compared with no mask use in the community but a major limitation of the studies is that they did not specify mask type low-certainty indirect evidence also found that n95 respirators may not reduce the risk for noncoronavirus respiratory infections compared with surgical masks or no masks and moderate-certainty indirect evidence showed that surgical masks probably do not reduce the risk compared with no masks for surgical masks there was moderate-certainty evidence of nonserious harms
such as discomfort and difficulty in breathing compared with no mask use and low-certainty evidence showed that n95 respirators may not increase discomfort compared with surgical masks the review identified no eligible studies on the use of cloth masks in community settingsn95 respirators should not be used in a community setting given the absence of demonstrated benefit the possible harm with improper use that is the requirement for fit testing and the global shortage of n95 respirators unlike n95 respirators surgical masks and cloth masks do not require special fitting making their use more practical if individual fitting is infeasible persons should seek guidance from the local community and statewide public health guidelines for mask use in light of the absence of evidence in the community setting to reduce the risk for transmission of sars-cov-2 infection factors to consider include exposure context number of people whether indoors or outdoors ventilation epidemiologic data such as reproduction rate daily case counts hospitalizations and deaths and local demographics such as high-risk populations individual values and preferences should be taken into account when deciding on the type of mask to use
surgical or cloth mask because the benefits and harms for surgical versus cloth masks are finely balanced the use of cloth masks in community settings has been encouraged by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 4 the world health organization who recommends a risk-based approach for decision makers when recommending use of nonmedical masks such as cloth masks in the community setting 6 the who notes potential risks associated with mask use including self-contamination via improper handling of masks breathing difficulties and a false sense of security that could potentially detract from taking other precautions such as physical distancing 6 regardless of mask type clinicians and public health officials should educate the general public about appropriate mask use table 3persons at highest risk for sars-cov-2 infection are those who are in close contact with persons who have covid-19 7 8 when in close contact with others persons experiencing symptoms and those in contact with them should wear a surgical mask or cloth mask a person who interacts with many people such as flight attendants restaurant servers grocery store workers cab drivers and others may benefit from wearing a surgical or cloth mask the use of masks is not necessary when at home unless a household member has covid-19
what is the effectiveness of n95 respirators surgical masks and cloth masks for the prevention of covid-19 in addition to standard precautions gowns  gloves  handwashing in health care settings
the goal of using respiratory ppe is to reduce exposure and prevent sars-cov-2 transmission between health care personnel and patients currently direct evidence on the effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of n95 respirators and surgical masks for preventing sars-cov-2 infection in health care settings is insufficient given the limited direct evidence our practice points are based on indirect evidence from studies of sars-cov-1 mers-cov influenza or influenza-like infections and other respiratory infectionslow-certainty evidence showed that mask use and consistent mask use may reduce the risk for sars-cov-1 infection compared with no mask use and inconsistent mask use in health care settings but studies did not specify mask type low-certainty indirect evidence showed that n95 respirators may reduce the risk for sars-cov-1 infection compared with surgical masks or no masks indirect evidence from studies reporting on the risk for noncoronavirus respiratory infections showed that n95 respirators probably do not reduce the risk for noncoronavirus respiratory infections compared with surgical masks moderate certainty and that surgical masks may reduce the risk for clinical respiratory illness laboratory-confirmed viral infections and influenza-like illness compared with cloth masks low certainty indirect evidence was insufficient about the effect of n95 respirators or surgical masks compared with cloth masks and surgical masks and cloth masks compared with no
masks on the risk for sars-cov-1 infection low-certainty evidence showed that n95 respirators may increase some nonserious harms such as discomfort breathing difficulties and headache compared with surgical masks and moderate-certainty indirect evidence that those harms probably do not increase with the use of surgical masks compared with cloth masksuncertainty about airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 continues 9 health care workers are at an increased risk for infection because they are more likely to be in close contact with patients who are confirmed or suspected to have covid-19 the cdc does not consider cloth masks as ppe in health care settings given the lack of evidence of their effectiveness against transmission of sars-cov-2 10health care personnel should not be exposed to patients suspected or known to have covid-19 without proper ppe it is essential to strictly follow all other infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene physical distancing and others along with appropriate use of other ppe such as gowns gloves and goggles in health care settings
what is the effectiveness for reuse or extended use of n95 respirators for prevention of covid-19
extended use is defined as wearing the same n95 respirator without removal between patient encounters 5 reuse is defined as using the same n95 respirator for several encounters with patients but removing it after each encounter 5 currently no evidence is available about the effectiveness of extended use or reuse of n95 respirators in health care settings however on the basis of an assessment of nonclinical outcomes such as measures of filtration contamination and mask failure a previous review comparing extended use and reuse of n95 respirators concluded that extended use of n95 respirators is preferable to reuse of n95 respirators because it involves less touching of the respirator thus less risk for contact transmission 11novel 2019 coronavirus disease covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 after the identification of 118 000 cases in 114 countries

 as government officials and public health stakeholders implement measures to slow the spread of sarscov2 healthcare workers treating covid19 patients are among those at highest risk of infection during the severe acute respiratory disease sars pandemic in 2003 healthcare workers made up 21 17068096 of global cases
2
 an early report from a singlecenter case series of 138 hospitalized patients for covid19 in wuhan china in january 2020 found that 29 40138 were healthcare workers that had been infected in hospital
3
 as of february 11 2020 chinas infectious disease information system has reported covid19 in 1716 healthcare workers
4

although the transmission of covid19 is not yet fully understood it is believed to be mainly through large respiratory droplets
5
 for aerosolgenerating procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy there is consensus that n95 respirators offer better protection than medical masks
6

9
 n95 respirators are designed to minimize facial seal leakage because of tight fit and prevent inhalation of small airborne particles they also are required to pass filtration tests in contrast medical masks also known as surgical masks are loose fitting provide barrier protection against large droplets and prevent handtoface contact
10

globally current recommendations to protect healthcare workers against covid19 for nonaerosolgenerating care are conflicting
6

9
 for example the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and european centre for disease and prevention ecdc recommend the n95 respirator for nonaerosolgenerating routine care of patients with covid19

 while the world health organization and the public health agency of canada recommend medical masks

shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers including medical masks and n95 respirators have been widely reported in this pandemic
11
 a shortage of n95 respirators for aerosolgenerating procedures where the risk to healthcare workers is high is of particular concern this along with conflicting recommendations warrants an update of previous systematic reviews where the last search was conducted in 2015
12
 
13
 evidence to support similar relative effectiveness of medical masks compared with n95 respirators might help preserve stockpiles of n95 respirators for aerosolgenerating procedures on the other hand if n95 respirators are clearly more effective then their use for nonaerosolgenerating procedures should be universally recommended we conducted an updated systematic review and metaanalysis to help answer this questionwe adapted search strategies published by smith et al by removing terms related to surrogate exposure studies ie simulations and experiments involving manikins and applying databasespecific randomized controlled trial rct filters appendix s2ac

to avoid unitofanalysis errors in pooling data from clusterrcts with individual participant rcts we adjusted metaanalyses by calculating the effective sample sizes of included clusterrcts we used data on the average cluster size and intraclass correlation coefficient icc to calculate the design effect of the clusterrct when not reported individual level data were divided by the design effect to calculate the effective sample sizes ie number of events in each trial arm and the total sample size of each trial arm were reduced by the amount of correlation in clusters we rounded effective sample sizes to the nearest whole number to be metaanalyzed

using the cochrane risk of bias tool randomized trials were judged to have low risk of selection attrition and reporting biases risk of performance bias was high across all trials and outcomes due to lack of blinding of participant healthcare workers risk of detection bias was high for influenzalike and clinical respiratory illness due to lack of laboratory confirmation but low for laboratoryconfirmed viral respiratory and influenza infection appendix s4 in applying grade the certainty of the overall evidence was judged to be low for laboratoryconfirmed respiratory infection and laboratoryconfirmed influenza infection and very low for influenzalike illness and clinical respiratory illness largely due to indirectness and imprecision table 2there is no convincing evidence that medical masks are inferior to n95 respirators for protecting healthcare workers against laboratoryconfirmed viral respiratory infections during routine care and nonaerosolgenerating procedures medical masks also performed similarly to n95 respirators in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza infection for influenzalike illnesses and clinical respiratory illnesses the point estimates favored n95 respirators however the confidence intervals were wide and there was considerable heterogeneity for the clinical respiratory illness outcome p  01 i
2  78 this heterogeneity may have been due to the subjective nature of the criteria used to define this outcome between trials appendix s3 reduced protection with medical masks during routine care of covid19 patients cannot be ruled out our low certainty in available evidence is because of its indirectness when we searched for randomized trials comparing the protective effect of medical masks to n95 respirators against coronaviruses we did not identify any for novel sarscov2 causing covid19our findings support preliminary epidemiological data from a casereport of respiratory protective devices for covid19
26
 fortyone healthcare workers were exposed to aerosolgenerating procedures from a patient with severe pneumonia who later tested positive for sarscov2 during covid19 surveillance these procedures included endotracheal intubation extubation noninvasive ventilation and exposure to aerosols in an open circuit all of the exposed healthcare workers tested negative 14 days after their date of exposure despite 85 3541 having worn surgical masks during the highrisk procedures
26
 given the limited direct evidence from this casereport further research on the risk of secondary infection in healthcare workers caring for covid19 patients is warrantedthere are several limitations in this metaanalysis first only one trial individually studied cases of coronavirus infection between medical masks and n95 respirators therefore we were unable to metaanalyze coronavirus infection specifically this led us to downgrade the evidence with grade as it relates to indirectness because our findings may not be generalizable to sarscov2 all trials however did report a composite outcome of laboratoryconfirmed viral respiratory infections that included coronavirus infections second this is a metaanalysis of aggregate data rather than individual data the latter would allow for harmonization of confounding covariates and outcome definitions specific to coronavirus infection the definition of influenzalike illness was based on a predetermined set of signs and symptoms however swabs in these studies were likely obtained using a more lenient threshold therefore there would have been swabs obtained even when the influenzalike illness criteria were not met this likely resulted in fewer influenzalike illness events compared with laboratoryconfirmed influenza infections reassuringly outcome definitions excluding clinical respiratory illness were consistent among all four studiesa strength of this review is that it is uptodate and incorporates the largest randomized trial of medical masks vs n95 respirators that have been completed to date
18
 secondly we used appropriate metaanalytic techniques that accounted for cluster randomization that was present in three of the four included trials
16
 
17
 
18
 cluster randomization was not adjusted for in the most recent metaanalysis potentially leading to falsely narrower confidence intervals around point estimates of protection
13
 
27

for aerosolgenerating procedures n95 respirators are unanimously recommended by national and international guidelines however there is inconsistency in recommendations for routine care and nonaerosolgenerating procedures of covid19 patients

 our evidence is in keeping with current who and public health agency of canada recommendations to use medical masks for nonaerosolgenerating procedures when caring for covid19 patients in contrast the cdc and ecdc recommend use of n95 respirators for nonaerosolgenerating procedures over the less expensive and more readily available medical maskswith the widespread of sarscov2 a serious concern is that stockpiles of n95 respirators will be depleted the department of health and human services announced that its strategic national stockpilethe emergency stockpile of drugs and medical supplies in the united statescontained approximately 30 million medical masks and 12 million n95 respirators this stockpile of respiratory protective devices equates to 1 of the estimated amount needed for us hcws in a pandemic scenario 42 million stockpiled compared with the estimated 35 billion needed

fmpswe followed the recommendations of prior authors to perform our cfa brown 2015 harrington 2009 although our eight face mask perception dimensions are measured via a single scale we do not consider these dimensions to form a unitary construct instead we conceptualize these dimensions as independent perceptions and therefore we modelled these dimensions as eight covaried latent factors  each with four indicators no secondorder factors were includedinitially our model fit indices cfi  86 ifi  86 rmsea  09 srmr  07 2df  341 fell short of recommended cutoffs cfi  095 ifi  095 rmsea  008 srmr  005

reporting of these factor loadings is included in appendix s4despite dramatic rises in coronavirus those in western societies appear reluctant to wear face masks bbc 2020a 2020b our goal was to develop the fmps to identify justifications for not wearing face masks via a threestudy process we developed a measure with satisfactory psychometric and validity evidence we supported an eightdimension structure via efa and cfa showing that face mask perceptions are complex people may have many justifications for not wearing face masks which poses several implications for research and practicemost broadly the current results can be situated within the comb model to understand their association with behavioural change and relevant interventions michie et al 2011 the comb model synthesizes extant models of behavioural change and provides an organizing framework to identify and interlink behavioural sources intervention functions and policy categories it identifies six behavioural sources nine intervention functions and seven policy categories face mask perceptions are a type of reflective motivation source which involves evaluation and cognition in developing behavioural attitudes reflective motivation sources are most closely associated with the intervention functions of education persuasion incentivization and coercion and these intervention functions are associated with each of the policy categories except environmentalsocial planning because several face mask perceptions significantly related to face mask wearing in the current study future authors should utilize the comb model to develop face mask interventions associated with education persuasion incentivization and coercion  the relevant intervention functions to reflective motivation sources and the fmpsin developing these interventions researchers should integrate frameworks associated with reflective motivation sources and these four intervention functions arden  chilcot 2020 bish  michie 2010 teasdale et al 2012 notably bish and michie 2010 systematically reviewed determinants of prevention behaviours during a pandemic in response to h1n1 swine flu they discovered that predictors of protective behaviours differ based on whether the behaviour is preventive or avoidant and they identified predictors of face mask wearing in the scope of preventive behaviours these included demographic characteristics gender age and marital status and attitudes perceived severity perceived susceptibility social pressure and perceived efficacy  the latter being a reflective motivation source only one of these antecedents perceived efficacy represents a perception identified in the current article and thereby their model can be expanded by incorporating the other perceptions also face mask perceptions may serve as mediators between certain antecedents and face mask wearing as many of their antecedents eg demographics social pressure are known to influence perceptions wilson et al 1988 identifying specific perceptions and not others as mediators may not only increase the sophistication of face mask research but it would also identify which face mask perceptions may be susceptible to influences and useful to target via interventions lastly bish and michie 2010 showed that some antecedents predicted other preventative behaviours but not face mask wearing this finding suggests that not all relations of preventative behaviours can generalize to face mask wearing emphasizing the need to replicate results regarding one type of preventative behaviour across each of the other types of preventative behaviourssimilar assertions could be made for teasdale et als 2012 findings these authors supported that as predicted by protective motivation theory threats and coping appraisals predict protective behaviours their experimental manipulations of threat and coping appraisals included the intervention functions of education persuasion incentivization andor coercion  aligning with the proposed associations of reflective motivation sources in the comb model future research could extend their findings to face masks by incorporating face mask perceptions as mediators of threats and coping appraisals effects on face mask wearing behavioursadditionally interventions to encourage face mask wearing are not a one size fits all approach instead researchers should consider specific perceptions in developing interventions and the most common perceptions may not be the most important to target while comfort for example was among the most common perceptions reported by participants it did not have significant relationships with face mask wearing other perceptions such as efficacy concerns may be more fruitful to address furthermore face mask perceptions may be associated with differing theoretical frameworks for instance the perception of efficacy doubts may be relevant to theory associated with message framing and even fake news eg prospect theory parallel response theory effron  raj 2020 gallagher  updegraff 2012 murphy et al 2019 as perceptions regarding the efficacy of face masks may be largely developed via communicated information and misinformation other face mask perceptions such as comfort may be less relevant to these theoretical approaches as perceptions of comfort may be more developed through embodied experiences than communicated information these differences emphasize the need for future researchers to apply multiple theoretical frameworks to understand face mask perceptions and behavioursfuture research should also replicate the current results and address our limitations although face mask perceptions likely differ between eastern and western populations we did not perform any tests of measurement invariance van de schoot et al 2012 the fmps may not be appropriate for use with eastern populations and future research should assess this possibility we also did not assess testretest reliability which would provide insights into the stability of face mask perceptions likewise we did not explore participant reactions to items via thinkaloud methods to identify problematic wording and cognitive burdens1we would like to thank the reviewer for identifying this future research direction devellis 2016 howard 2018 presser  blair 1994 and such an assessment would provide insights into the ease or difficulty of completing the fmpsall authors declare no conflict of interestcoronaviruses spread mainly through inhalation of droplets direct or indirect contacts and to a limited scale aerosol-related transmission direct contact means the virus is transmitted from the infected to the healthy through direct physical contacts whereas indirect contacts are usually transmitted through fomites droplets as well can transmit the infection both by direct and indirect means it can be inhaled directly by others when the infected cough or sneeze in contrast droplets may settle on table surface and later on when another person touches the table before touching his own mucosal surfaces including nose mouth and eyes the transmission of disease might then happen13aerosols are a collection of very tiny droplets in air produced in specific circumstances which are capable of traveling a longer distance and longer time in air compared to typical droplets before settling down owing to the small size and light weight aerosols can be generated during aerosol-generating procedures in hospital settings such as resuscitation endotracheal intubation positive pressure ventilation tracheostomy insertion bronchosocopy and airway suction and so on45 when medical personnel is performing aerosol-generating procedures full personal-protective equipment should be put on including goggles n95 respirators face shield protective gowns and shoe-cover among others coughing sneezing toilet flushing cigarette smoke and hot pot steam among others might also have a possibility to generate infective aerosols but need further studies to confirm it fig 1
epidemiologists use basic reproductive number r0 to represent the infectivity of certain infectious disease it is defined as the number of individuals being infected when a confirmed case enters the population composed of only susceptible individuals6 for example r0  10 means on average an infected patient would infect one other healthy individual in the community and r0  20 refers to 2 healthy individuals acquired the infection from a single confirmed case r0 of covid-19 was initially estimated to be 22 to 27 however as more data are available with time some epidemiologists suggested that the true r0 of this virus could be much higher and lies between 33 and 547 or even higher between 47 and 6678 in contrast r0 of sars-cov were 188 in beijing 170 in hong kong and 095 worldwide910 where r0 of mers-cov were 047 in middle east 045 in saudi arabia and 091 overall for middle east and south korea1011 the infectivity of covid-19 is therefore highest among the 3 lethal coronavirus infections the cfr however has a reverse order for the 3 viruses when comparing with infectivity they are 67 96 and 344 for covid-19 sars and mers respectively12sars-cov-2 utilizes the same cellular receptors as sars-cov the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 therefore it is expected that this new virus would behave very similar to sars-cov in terms of transmission properties such as causing lower instead of upper respiratory tract symptoms13 however unlike sars-cov or mers-cov epithelial cells in human airway are more suitable than standard tissue culture medium for the growth of sars-cov-213 moreover the incubation period of this virus is up to 24 days and the virus is capable of transmitting the disease even when patients only have mild or even no symptoms14 unlike sars in which most patients developed fever studies from china and europe showed only 43 to 48 of them had fever at the time of admission1516 this renders comprehensive early identification of cases extremely difficult lastly the low cfr of the disease relative to sars and mers may make people more complacent and less compliant with preventive measures with global spread the role of quarantine is to slow or stop the transmission of infection so that serious cases are at least spread over a longer period of time an uncontrolled outbreak of infection could easily overwhelm the ability to care for patients and lead to exponential spread all of the aforementioned characteristics of covid-19 facilitate the transmission of virus in the community thus increasing the difficulty of its containment further studies to investigate the mechanisms for covid-19s high infectivity are warrantedcoronaviruse covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to the nidovirales order the name coronavirus comes from the latin corona which means crown due to its characteristic appearance that resembling a crown or solar corona cov can induce respiratory gastrointestinal and neurological dysfunction in their hosts and predominately respiratory infections in human fig 217
a total of 7 species of covs have been found to be pathogenic to humans including hku1 oc43 nl63 and 229e which can lead to mild upper respiratory tract infections and are still circulating among human1819 whereas the more aggressive sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are zoonotic and these viruses crossed species from animals and infected humansars was first known to human in 2002 to 2003 starting in guangdong province of china infecting 8098 people worldwide and with a cfr of 962021 mers-cov however first appeared in 2012 in saudi arabia infected almost 2500 people mainly in the middle east and korea and with a high cfr of 34422 recently a new member to the coronavirus family sars-cov-2 has led to a large-scale pandemic with an estimated cfr of 6723the earliest cluster of covid-19 identified as pneumonia of unknown etiology or atypical pneumonia was defined as evidence of pneumonia on x-ray or computer tomography scans fever of 38c normal or low white blood cell count and no clinical improvement despite standard antibiotics treatment for 3 to 5 days according to the studies from china and europe symptoms of covid-19 include fever olfactory dysfunction gustatory dysfunction cough fatigue sputum shortness of breath and conjunctival injection and so on fig 3131516
viable sars-cov-2 could be detected in aerosol up to 3 hours after aerosolization thus raising concerns on the possibility of viral transmission through aerosolization the survival time of sars-cov-2 varies among different materials for example viable sars-cov-2 could only be detected on copper up to 4 hours but its survival time could be as long as 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel table 124 therefore indirect transmission of sars-cov-2 through fomite is highly likely to lower the risk of infection we must always remain vigilant and be aware of personal hygienedroplets in term of respiratory infections refer to small liquid drops that are generated by expiratory events such as coughing sneezing laughing talking or even breathing25 aerosols are suspensions of small liquid droplets or solid particles in air droplets are subdivided by size into large and small droplets and the smallest form as droplet nuclei the size definitions vary among studies but most naturally and artificially produced aerosols contain a range of droplet sizes after being expelled droplets are usually brought down to ground under gravity and are transmitted over a limited distance only however the water content of small droplets may evaporate during the stay in air producing even smaller droplet nuclei that could then remain suspended in air and could be transmitted over a long distance fig 126standard recommendation on hand hygiene is to use alcohol-based handrubs or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds when hands are visibly dirty there is no doubt that washing hands with soap and water is necessary27 however when hands are not visibly dirty there had been controversies regarding the effectiveness of different methods the current recommendation by cdc and who put alcohol-based handrubs as preferred method as it demonstrated better antiseptic efficacy it is also easier to be used at the point of care and is minimally time-consuming resulting in better compliance28 on a further note use of gloves does not constitute part of hand hygiene proper hand hygiene should still be performed before and after wearing gloves it is not recommended to use alcohol-based handrubs while gloves are on handsalcohols such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol could be used as hand rubbing agents or disinfectant for general surfaces and ophthalmic instruments both alcohols exert their antimicrobial activity by protein denaturation and are equally effective at 60 to 80 concentrations29 ethanol is the ingredient present in most alcoholic drink however commercially available high concentration ethanol may contain toxic additives to prevent people from drinking as required by certain countries making it less popular as disinfectant isopropyl alcohol however is produced in high quantities with high purity and is widely used in households and industries as disinfectants or detergentsface mask is defined as a physical barrier loosely worn between the mouth and nose of the wearer and the surrounding it is not tightly fit and offers no air-sealing surgical masks are face masks that are qualified to prevent contamination of sterile surgical field respirators eg n95 respirators are air filtration devices designed to remove particulates from inhaled air it should be tightly fitted onto the mouth and nose to ensure air sealing one major common property is that they utilize filters to prevent unwanted substances from passing through the barrier while allowing air to pass through30 filters can capture particles of different size through various mechanisms larger particles are captured by filter fibers directly when they impact or intercept the fibers smaller particles are constantly bombarded by air molecules causing them to deviate from the air stream and come into contact with a fiber furthermore oppositely charged particles are attracted to charged fiber all particles that come into contact with a fiber will stay attached to the fiber firmly in that way filters can capture particles smaller than the pore size structures and mechanisms of various filter materials are illustrated in figure 4
surgical masks are regulated by the food and drug administration and should fulfill requirements set by the american society for testing and materials astm there are 3 levels 1 2 and 3 of surgical masks and the function and performance details are shown in table 2 n95 respirators are primarily developed for industrial safety to reduce particulates inhaled by wearers3031 they are certified by national institute for occupational safety and health niosh under the guidance of niosh 42 cfr part 84 with the mark niosh printed on the surface of the respirators the notation 95 implies that they can filter at least 95 of particles sized 03 microns and n represents non-oil particles they are tested under stringent protocols which aim to simulate the worst case condition32 noncharged sodium chloride particles of 03 m was selected which represent the most penetrating particle size where the particles are most likely to bypass various mechanisms to capture them n95 respirators have also been tested under conditions similar to that of astm standards showing filtration efficiency of 99 for uncharged particles sized around 01 m33 the overall filtration efficiency of n95 respirators is superior to surgical masks of all astm levels see fig 5 for performance of various respirators and masks34
n95 respirators offer better protection than surgical masks which are loosely fit and not air-tight both of them offer protection against splash of fluid and droplets but only n95 respirators protect the wearer against small viral particles or aerosol inhalation fitting procedure is required for n95 to ensure tight air-seal and should not be worn by children men with beard or individuals with breathing difficulty n95 respirators offer better protection against air-borne infection for surgical masks fitting procedure is not required although the theoretical particle filtration efficiency of the filter material in surgical mask may reach 98 for astm level 2 and 3 masks the actual total inward leakage til may reach 30 to 35 due to inadequate sealing3435 therefore 30 to 35 of air that is breathed into the wearers respiratory system might not have passed through the filtering materials of surgical marks this is the reason why surgical masks can prevent droplets but not airborne particles or aerosols despite that surgical masks should be worn by individuals with suspected respiratory infections effectively lowering the environmental contamination due to droplets expelled by individuals with respiratory infectionfor healthcare workers surgical masks should be worn when performing sterile procedures or as general protection against droplets infections for public use such as individuals with respiratory symptoms people exposed in crowded and poorly ventilated places such as taking public transports students in school and individuals visiting clinics or hospitals surgical masks are also recommended36 n95 respirators are recommended to be worn by healthcare workers when working in high-risk areas such as fever wards inpatient or isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected covid-1936 they should be removed and discarded when leaving the patient room or care area followed by immediate hand hygienethe outer layer of masks is considered dirty whereas the inner layer is relatively clean hand hygiene should be performed before and after taking off the mask to avoid contamination of our hands mask should be fitted snugly over the face other points worth noting are the colored side of the mask should face outwards the metallic strip at the uppermost side molds to the bridge of the nose the mask covers the nose mouth and chin the strings or elastic bands are positioned properly to keep the mask firmly in place and avoid touching or manipulating the mask once secured on face as frequent handling may reduce its protection if you must do so wash your hands before and after touching would helpchange masks timely replace the mask immediately if it is damaged wetted or soiled after taking off the mask discard it into a lidded waste bin and perform hand hygiene immediatelysurgical n95 mask is a subgroup of n95 respirator that also fulfils astm requirements and food and drug administration-cleared as surgical mask they are fluid-resistant whereas other standard n95 respirators may not be fluid-resistant both types exhibit similar filtration efficiencies for small particles like viruses for general protection of the wearer standard or surgical n95 respirators will all suffice32 the key difference is that the surgical n95 masks prevent the wearers from contaminating the surgical field or environment and are used when performing sterile procedures under the threat of air-borne transmissionthere are industrial respirators with higher filtration efficiency available eg n99 p100 etc however their uses in healthcare settings are often limited due to relatively lower breathability respiratory distress may occur after prolonged wearing n95 respirators already provide good protection against viral droplets or aerosol protection and their breathability are similar to surgical masks therefore they are satisfactory in most healthcare settings especially when prolonged wearing is needed31no the protection is very limited although reusable cotton masks can be sterilized for reuse they generally suffer from limitations including low filtration efficiency time-consuming production and higher risk of contamination charcoal-activated carbon masks are intended to absorb chemicals from inhaled air those masks are not formally tested for the particle and bacterial filtration efficiency and do not claim for protection from air-borne or droplet transmission at the height of covid-19 epidemic it would be better than none to be worn by patients with respiratory symptoms to reduce environmental contamination if surgical masks are not availableyes conjunctivitis could be present in covid-19 patients and virus may even be present in their tears and conjunctival secretion direct contact with the ocular surface and mucosal membrane during routine ophthalmic examination may have risk of infection the doctorpatient distance during examination is usually 1 m where the possibility of droplet transmission is high if there is no proper protection air jet produced in non-contact tonometry might also generate aerosol of fluids from the eye which might be infectious last but not least ophthalmic centers may be crowded with patients with potential risk of infection extra precautions should be taken in ophthalmic practicespreventing patients with potential respiratory infection from entering the facilities might minimize the change of exposure for patients with potential risk nonurgent ophthalmic consultations will be deferred after appropriate period of quarantine and observation special precautions will be taken in handling such patients with sight-threatening conditions fig 6 and table 3
patients are screened before entering the facilities by phone screening and triage at the entrance face masks should be worn by all personnel and visitors inside the facilities visitors wait at an adequately ventilated area keeping at least 1-m distance from others and were provided with adequate alcohol-based handrubs rubbish bins and educational material in the waiting area in consultation rooms transparent shields are installed on slit-lamps to prevent droplet transmission all instruments and surfaces are disinfected properly after each useif patients are screened as high risk of covid-19 infection and having ophthalmic emergencies doctor-in-charge should be informed ideally patient should be isolated in a single room with a dedicated team of healthcare workers entering with full personal protective equipment including n95 respirators for examination patients are not allowed to enter the public waiting areas potentially aerosol-generating procedures are to be avoided all equipments are disinfected immediately after patient contactin slit-lamp examination physical barrier between doctors and patients is advisable to prevent droplet transmission commercially available breath shields are available but producing home-made shields is not difficult the material chosen should be highly transparent to allow effective visualization rigid enough not to collapse and thin enough to be cut into desired shape fig 7 a clear polyvinyl chloride document holder is a good choice make a central opening and fit it in between the optical modules the edges of the shield should be smoothen with a sand paper polisher should it be too rough or sharp the size of the shield should not be too small in which protection effect will be compromised or too large in which manipulation of the slit-lamp equipment will become difficult the size of an a3 size paper or one that is slightly larger would be quite optimal and recommended the location of the hole is also important we want the upper portion to be larger to provide more protection while the lower portion to be smaller to allow easier access to slit-lamp manipulation it should be cleaned and disinfected regularly
the patient contact areas of general equipment such as slit-lamp non-contact tonometer autorefractor and so on should be disinfected with 70 to 75 ethanol or isopropyl alcohol immediately after each use instruments that had direct contact with patients ocular surface such as goldmann applanation tonometer prisms and diagnostic contact lenses are disinfected by immersion in either 110 diluted bleach solution with sodium hypochlorite or 3 hydrogen peroxide for at least 5 minutes surgical instruments are sterilized according to standard protocolssurgical mask should be worn by all patients entering operating rooms to prevent contamination from coughing or sneezing adhesive tape could be applied across the nose bridge area to ensure complete coverage of patients nose and mouth in our center we also require patients changing their clothes and putting on surgical caps to further reduce the risk for patients with suspected respiratory infection or exposure risk only urgent operations would be considered they would be scheduled as last case of operation to allow thorough disinfection afterwards all personnel should be cautious and vigilant against sharp needles or blades injury it would be a good idea to refer high-risk cases to hospitals that have adequate facilities such as negative-pressure isolation rooms to provide proper care to patientsthe outbreak of covid-19 has now spread to every part of the world the key to successful reduction in morbidity and mortality during this pandemic relies on early identification containment prevention of transmission and adequate supportive treatments before safe and effective vaccines and specific treatments are available the only way to control and contain covid-19 would be applying the basic principles and measures in the prevention of the transmission of the diseasecovid-19 is an infectious disease following every rule in the field of infection control therefore as long as good infection control measures are implemented prevention of disease spreading and zero new case in medical practices are not impossible these are extremely important and relevant since there have been at least 3000 and 2600 medical professionals and healthcare workers infected in china and italy respectively in the midst of the current pandemic everyone on this planet has to be highly vigilant and compliant to the precautions we hope our answers to the frequently asked questions would help one to be more fully equipped with the necessary knowledge and know-how to protect oneself and the people around himheruntil recently it was supposed according to a world health organization report from february 2020 1 that the proportion of truly asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection was relatively small and not a major driver of virus circulation infection transmission and new disease development however recently collected data seem to completely negate this statement in a study carried out in an isolated village of approximately 3000 people in northern italy it was shown that 5075 of people with positive pharyngeal molecular tests were totally asymptomatic 2 this finding was confirmed by a more recent evaluation carried out in china where to avoid a new outbreak of new coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 all the people arriving from overseas were rigorously tested 3 it was found that among patients with newly identified infections 78 were asymptomatic although few data collected in children seem to indicate that asymptomatic cases are common also in pediatrics an observational cohort study enrolling 36 children aged 016 years mean 83 years with laboratory confirmed covid-19 revealed that 10 of them 28 were totally asymptomatic 4 similar findings were reported in a study enrolling a greater number of covid-19 children mean age 67 years in which it was evidenced that among 171 patients 27 158 were asymptomatic 5 although the amount of viral load associated with sars-cov-2 transmission is not known and viral shedding increases with increasing covid-19 severity 6 it seems likely that at least some asymptomatic people of any age can transmit the infection and become important sources of new covid-19 casesin addition cases of certain transmission of sars-cov-2 infection from an asymptomatic contact have been described 6 7 contrarily to adults and old people that frequently have moderate or severe clinical manifestations about 50 of symptomatic children have a mild disease that tends to solve spontaneously and does not require medical intervention 8 these cases are not recognized often as covid-19 but can contribute to increase virus circulation and new covid-19 case developmentto reduce the role of asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic people in sars-cov-2 diffusion the centers for disease control and prevention in the usa has modified previous recommendations suggesting that together with infected persons and health care workers healthy people should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities 9 the need for universal use of cloth face coverings or when available of surgical masks seems further suggested by the results of some studies that support the hypothesis that face masks are effective in reducing the presence of viral particles in droplets and aerosol generated by symptomatic sars-cov-2infected individuals 10until some weeks ago it was thought that the virus could be transmitted mainly by droplets that are coughed or sneezed out or by previously contaminated objects with differences according to the initial load and surface characteristics 11 airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 was considered possible only when care procedures that generate aerosols such as intubation bronchoscopy and positive-pressure ventilation are performed 12 however the results of some submitted but not yet peer-reviewed studies seem to indicate the opposite ie the virus can be present in exhaled air produced by talking and breathing 13 moreover a potential role of aerosols in virus diffusion was evident in a complex laboratory study aerosols containing a viral load quite similar to that observed in human respiratory samples were created to generate an aerosolized environment sars-cov-2 was detected up to 3 h after the start of the study 14 although these findings were not considered fully convincing by some authors 11 they deserve attention and require further studies to establish whether and when airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 truly occurs and how it can be reduced the maximal distance between persons that still allow airborne transmission the size of aerosolized particles that are generated the lowest infection dose and how long a person must remain in a room containing aerosols with the virus to become infected are among the problems that must be solved to evaluate the real importance of air transmission problems and make decisions on preventive measures answers to these questions are essential to establish whether surgical masks that are suggested for the prevention of infection due to asymptomatic subjects can also be effective for the prevention of airborne transmissiontable 1 summarizes the different types of face masks and which could be good or not for children in the community whereas the effectiveness of homemade cloth face coverings is debated it is well known that surgical masks can prevent the inhalation of large droplets and sprays although they have a poor ability to filter submicron-sized airborne particles 15 as airborne transmission refers to particles  5 m in diameter it cannot be determined whether they are always effective at least when they are properly used on the other hand in some cases such as those with very small particles and a high viral load surgical masks could fail and allow infection diffusion to solve the problem the size of sars-cov-2 aerosolized particles produced by cough sneeze talking and breathing should be determined however in favor of surgical masks there are studies that were carried out in the prevention of influenza a viral disease with some similarities with covid-19 and during the sars epidemic a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing surgical masks and n95 respirators in preventing influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza showed that these two preventive measures were similarly effective 16 similar results were obtained in a retrospective study carried out in five hong kong hospitals in which the effect of surgical masks and n95 respirators in the prevention of sars among health care workers was compared even in this case no difference was evidenced between the two masks 17 on the other hand wearing n95 respirators that are designed to achieve a very close facial fit and that can block 03-m particles is associated with an increased effort in breathing leading to discomfort tiredness or headaches after few hours of use this explains why the use of n95 respirators is recommended only for health care workers that must take care of infected patients and can be exposed to aerosolized particles of very small size 18however protecting healthy children with a mask can be very difficult it is recommended that children younger than 2 years of age do not wear any type of mask as they having very small airways can struggle to breathe moreover as they can be unable to remove the mask without assistance they are at increased risk of suffocation 19 for infants particularly the youngest social distancing remains together with washing hands and avoiding licking things the measure of choice to reduce risk of sars-cov-2 infection as highlighted by the american academy of pediatrics 20 surgical masks of smaller size suitable for children from 3 to 12 years old are marketed moreover according to the us centers for disease prevention and control 19 they can be prepared at home from common materials at low cost however in toddlers and children of the first school years frequently masks do not fit snugly on the face with the risk that contaminated air can access or mask is poorly tolerated moreover as generally children do not like to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it as well as touch their face more the use of mask can favor infection development consequently preparing the healthy child to use the mask is strongly needed if problems must be avoided to obtain maximal compliance reasons for mask wearing without attempts of removing it must be clearly explained finally childs will must not be forcedwhile waiting for the results of the abovementioned studies on the transmission of sars-cov-2 on the basis of clinical findings we think that the universal use of facial masks seems necessary when people have to go out in their everyday lives however the use in children poses a whole series of problems that are not easily solved in addition to the availability of masks of different sizes capable of adapting perfectly to the face it is necessary that the use of masks in children is preceded by a strong parental work with the main aim to obtain child cooperation this seems particularly important for healthy subjects that have to wear the mask for the first time children with chronic respiratory disease such as those with cystic fibrosis that are used to use mask have less problems if compliance is difficult it is better that the child does not wear the mask and other measures or reducing infection risk including remaining at home are practiced a systematic adoption of face masks might have important implication for the opening of schools and schools should focus some lessons on this issue to favor the use of masks among children and support parents in this work on the other hand in addition to face masks the other measures of covid-19 prevention such as safety distance or hand washing despite not always easy with children should not be forgotten especially in schoolson jan 7 2020 a novel coronavirus was identified by the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdcp from the throat swab sample of a patient and was subsequently named 2019-ncov4 the disease was of cluster onset resulting in severe and even fatal infections a lower respiratory tract predilection suggested that airborne transmission was possible5 in comparison sars was transmitted by droplet contact and airborne spread including ventilation pipes between building floorsamong the general public in china and other countries the transmissibility of the epidemic might be reduced because of community- wide social distancing measures as reported by wu6 studies suggested that hand hygiene and facemasks seemed to prevent household transmission of influenza virus and the nonpharmaceutical interventions are important for mitigation of pandemic 7investigation on spatiotemporal transmission patterns and intervention strategies are warranted integrated interventions such as the promotion of face mask use and reduction of travel have been actively implemented studies suggest that additional 10 decay in the transmission rate would reduce the peak infected population size by 20-47 as reported by shen8 experts suggest that people stay at home and use masks for personal protection as reported by kickbusch9 public health policy officials recommend that at least 70 of the population comply with face mask usage to avoid the breakdown of the healthcare system10the worldwide spread of sars proceeded with rapidity overwhelming many hospitals and public health systems among infected cases of sars reported worldwide about 17 to 30 were aged 50 or older11 in many locations the disease spread to health care workers and household contacts many infectious diseases spread through populations via the networks formed by physical contacts among individuals the patterns of these contacts tend to be highly heterogeneous and illustrate the utility for assessing public health strategies as reported by meyer12hospitals remind people to wear face masks at worksites and in public places health care professionals also promote face mask usage to individuals in public areas to prevent spreading disease13 a casecontrol study was conducted in five hong kong hospitals with 241 non-infected and 13 infected staff during patient care14 all participants were surveyed about the use of mask gloves gowns and hand-washing as recommended under droplet and contact precautions practice of droplet and contact precaution was found to be adequate in reducing the risk of infectionthe health belief model has been proposed as a means of understanding an individuals volitional health behaviors during the sars epidemic wong et al1 found that only 548 of chinese adolescents practiced recommended habitual behaviors for preventing the spread of the disease there was a significant correlation between perceiving a significant threat and compliance with habitual behaviorsthrough the schools regulation and auxiliary measures taiwans students still attended classes till june 2020 after the identification of 2019-ncov taiwanese health authorities stepped up various prevention and intervention activities against the further spreading schools and universities were suspended for prompt isolation of infected individuals in february 2020 quarantined individuals were required to wear surgical masks whenever they enter a communal area at the individual level suggested preventative behaviors included i maintaining good personal hygiene ii developing a healthy lifestyle with proper diet regular exercise and adequate rest iii ensuring adequate ventilation at home and in the office and iv wearing masks especially for those with preexisting respiratory tract infections people are warned to avoid close contact and the duration of time that the virus can survive on the surface of an object contact tracking and family isolation were arranged to strengthen control according to the literature perceived susceptibility perceived severity and action cues are important predictors of wearing a mask in this study we investigated both young peoples mask usage behavior and simulated experiment with possible contact area spreadingsurgical masks are intended to protect the patient from the surgeon during surgery ffp2 masks are intended to protect the user15 the outermost covering is an isolation layer intended to block larger dust particles the second layer has a filter which removes fine dust and bacterium in the air the outside of the mask is considered a contaminated area and should not be touched with the hands when pulling the elastic band backward to remove the mask the user needs to grasp the strap of the mask to avoid contact the gap of the mask must be small and it should be replaced after cumulative use masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission even very weak masks can still be useful16the centers for disease control and prevention developed recommendations for respirators worn to minimize exposures to mycobacterium tuberculosis17 handling may increase the risk of infection if loaded organisms remain viable li18 assessed the antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles and nanoparticle-coated face masks to protect against infectious agents nanoparticles have shown promise when applied as a coating to the surface of protective clothing in reducing the risk of transmission of infectious agents lin et al19 sought a method for recovering loaded bacteria from filtering respirators and investigated the effects of artificial saliva as and artificial perspiration ap on the filter performance ap was especially effective in n95 masks and as was especially effective in surgical masksindirect contact infection caused by re-contact with hands should also be considered for example the chance of infection increases if medical personnel make contact with patients but do not disinfect their hands after adjusting their masks people who wear masks may nevertheless be exposed to infection during drinking donning and doffing a mask will also increase the chance of infectionboth questionnaire surveys and experimental were utilized the survey can understand the users thoughts and expectations and the experiment can observe the usage behavior and contact areadata for this study was obtained using a questionnaire survey of young adults aged 18-21 residing in taiwan university students from four different departments took part in the survey n160 respondents were asked to indicate on a 5-point scale the degree to which they agreed that wearing face masks could induce problem or inconvenience 1 indicating strongly disagree 5 indicating strongly agree high scores indicated that respondents perceived significant problems or inconvenience in wearing face masks five main problems of wearing face masks were listed 1 discomfort with inhaling and exhaling 2 excessive warmth and humidity 3 unpleasant odor 4 inconvenience with donning and doffing and 5 tendency for glasses to fog upthis experiment intended to observe potential contact transmission spread to other surfaces during mask usage the face masks outer surface is a potential contamination source in this contact area experiment 10 adults were requested to don and doff a face mask while performing an office task the contact areas associated with face mask handling were recorded by a camera different colors of dye were placed on the outer surface of a face mask the dye simulated the possible virus area on the mask surface during usage contacting this area by hand or other parts of the body extended the contact area participants behavior while wearing face masks was recorded and image analysis was utilized to identify the extended contact areaexperiments were performed in a preset environment with a computer and assorted stationery on the desk figure 1 subjects were required to complete a questionnaire and simulate the spread of contact transmission when using a computer the equipment the subjects touched included the computer tower keyboard mouse screen desktop and assorted stationery the researcher prepared powder toner 10 colors one color for each subject a face mask with powder coating a 28-foot length of thin black cloth used to cover the workstation and camera the experimental procedure was as followsafter all subjects had participated pictures were then taken of the contaminated area and the black cloth was cleaned of powder rhino software was used to remove the black background in each photo to calculate the contaminated areabehavioral surveys were collected and analyzed with spss the results were selected for discussion below the average total use time of mask was 5306 hours 638 of respondents said that they donned and doffed their masks several times because of work masks were usually placed in the following locations bags 60 jacket pockets 17 pants pockets 15 and desk surfaces 8 masks that were carried around had a risk of indirect contamination regarding the feeling of using the mask the mean value of inconvenience of inhalation was 3487 the average value of excessive warmth and humidity was 4025 and the mean of inconvenience with donning and doffing the mask was 3168 a high degree of agreement indicated that maintaining smooth breathing was a major problem when wearing a face mask table 1 shows the mean scores and standard deviation values for those statementsthere was a statistically significant positive relationship between participants feeling too hot and feeling discomfort with breathing and foggy glasses the high mean scores ranged from 3168 to 4025 and the correlation coefficient values ranged from 0426 to 0387 p001 the inconvenience of inhalation was significantly related to the feeling of excessive heat pearson correlation coefficient  is 0426 p0000 this data reflects the feeling that the structure and use of the face mask could be improvedthe mean value of unpleasant odor was 3462 and that of glasses fogging up was 3918 the distribution was skewed right and the maximum reported value was 5 a high degree of consensus indicated that respondents were concerned that face masks are vented upwards which might infect their eyes this might affect the masks effectiveness in preventing disease transmissionthe experimental environment and process are shown in figure 1 after each test a researcher took four photos of the subject body front back left and right in addition photographs of the contaminated locations on workspace were also taken figure 2 shows that the contamination area varied with different users the average contaminated area of the ten subjects was 530 cm2 with the maximum contamination area reaching three times that of the minimumalthough surgical masks are considered a viable means of protecting individuals from disease during an epidemic accidental transmission through direct and indirect contact still puts face mask users at risk of infection the survey of mask usage revealed the usage per day during an epidemic prevention period was 5306 hours because most people repeatedly donned and doffed their masks there was a high possibility of pollution during use during the experiment the subjects often had no specific place to store their masks so they often stored the masks in their pockets which might cause indirect contact transmission of pathogens the average inconvenience of mask inhalation is high and the mean value of hot and sultry is 4025 a high degree of the agreement indicates that the smoothness of breathing is troublesome the contact spread experiments show that the contaminated area varies considerably from user to user the average polluted area of the ten subjects was 530 cm2 hand contact is one of the transmission paths when the hand touches the surface of the mask it may spread the virus to the subsequent contact area which is worthy of attention for general usersnovel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is spreading fast around the world with many uncertainties about routes of transmission treatment and prevention currently the united states has the highest number of cases no drugs or vaccines have yet proven to be effective and non-vaccine preventative measures are the key in our fight against this transmissible virus with high mortality the who recommends robust control measures to contain community spread of infection worldwide but the virus is nonetheless spreading within communities and we have had limited success in breaking the transmission chain although new evidence supports tremendous capacity of this virus to spread from asymptomatic individuals messages about public masking remain conflicting more clarification from international organizations is needed to optimally support efforts to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2we now know that a significant portion of coronavirus-infected individuals are asymptomatic or even minimally symptomatic with nonspecific symptoms13 and can spread the infection45 in a study from china nasopharyngeal viral loads from asymptomatic individuals were as high as those from symptomatic patients suggesting the potential for a major role in community transmission6 in an observational study in china asymptomatic sars-cov-2infected individuals were identified as sources of infection in 79 of confirmed cases7 during the diamond princess cruise ship investigation 712 of 3711 individuals tested positive whereas 331 465 of positive cases were asymptomatic at the time of testing in follow-up 179 of infected cases never developed symptoms8 based on this understanding of virus transmission public health experts urged mass masking to prevent virus spread9as of the time of this writing mid-april 2020 the who recommends against public masking for asymptomatic individuals10 but the science around this topic has been rapidly advancing some countries austria czech republic china hong kong israel italy japan mongolia singapore south korea taiwan turkey and the united states have taken varied steps to advocate universal masking as an additional step to reduce community transmission of sars-cov-2 the who has not endorsed this as a global policy yet possibly because of lack of supply limited evidence for effectiveness potential noncompliance andor concerns regarding increased anxiety and stigmatization engendered by masking moreover there is concern that public masking will limit the supply of essential masks for healthcare workers and others at the highest risk of infection however a resistance to mass masking seems inconsistent with our knowledge of the rate of asymptomatic infections and the risk of transmission from these individualsthe us cdc has recommended a policy of cloth face covering in public where social distancing is hard to maintain but this policy has been practiced in many different ways11 following this recommendation mandatory universal masking for all hospital visitors patients and healthcare workers has been proposed12 and implemented as a robust preventive strategy in many american healthcare facilities including massachusetts general hospital the johns hopkins university and health system the university of maryland medical system the university of chicago medical center the university of illinois hospital the university of rochester medical center the university of california san francisco the university of virginia heath system rochester regional health and st lukes university health network this list is growing fastoutside of healthcare settings for many people the motivation for wearing a mask is primarily for their own protection which unintentionally leads to protecting their community we consider both protection of the wearer and of the community to be important but we believe that source control is most important in a systematic review before the sars-cov-2 pandemic wearing face masks reduced the odds of contracting acute respiratory infections by 6 among casual community contacts and by 19 among household contacts if both the infected and healthy individuals wore masks13 masks have been shown to be effective in reducing respiratory virus shedding from droplets and aerosols of symptomatic individuals infected with coronavirus influenza virus and rhinovirus14 there is also laboratory evidence that homemade masks effectively stop droplets from infecting the wearer15surgical masks are disposable and designed to protect healthcare workers although surgeons used cloth masks to protect wounds from droplets many years ago the barrier layer in cloth masks is usually two layers of cotton-woven fabric compared with two to four layers of nonwoven polypropylene fabric with filtration holes in surgical masks effectiveness of cloth masks compared with surgical masks needs further evaluation because some clinical studies have raised concerns regarding their effectiveness16 however the wearing of cloth masks by asymptomatic individuals is justified by evidence that droplets and aerosols get trapped when they hit the weave of the fabric with potentially better trapping than surgical masks in any case cloth masks have been adopted as an alternative when surgical masks are limited in supply17 moreover cloth masks are cheap washable easy to make and can be used by the general population without imposing extra cost to local governments while they are already overwhelmed by lack of resourceswhile the sars-cov-2 pandemic rages most nations are not receiving clear and concise instructions about public masking from public health authorities we call on who and country-level public health leaders to urgently consider revising their policies on mass masking to facilitate implementation of appropriate interventions in communities around the world considering the close community contact in densely populated areas around the world and documented evidence of sars-cov-2 transmission from asymptomatic individuals it is appropriate to consider masking as a robust tool to limit sars-cov-2 transmission this is highly recommended in public places including public transportation grocery stores bakeries pharmacies hospitals rehabilitation units nursing homes offices places of religious worship workplaces or even crowded streets in summary laboratory data support both surgical and cloth masks but real-world efficacy of cloth masks needs further evaluation cloth masks are affordable globally and might be the only option in some areas with limited resources based on our current level of evidence we highly recommend mass masking around the world during the pandemic whereas surgical masks are the preferred recommendation for the general public cloth masks should be considered as a substitute if supplies are limited or surgical masks are not availableinternet access has increased worldwide during the past decade reaching 796 of the european population and 48 of the world population in 2017 1 in the united states 90 of adults access the internet 2 and 531 look for health information online 3as with previous epidemics such as ebola or zika infections the internet has become a favored mechanism for the spread of misinformation 45 this has implications for public health behavior and health-related decision making 6at present an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has occurred and has spread throughout china and to dozens of countries 7 as in other epidemics people want to know what can be done to prevent and treat the disease 6 since there is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment the application of preventive measures is essentialin this context we aimed to conduct an infodemiological study 89 to investigate the information about the prevention of covid-19 available on the interneton february 29 2020 we performed a google search and selected the first 20 links 5 of the google search results excluding advertisements the search terms used were prevention coronavirus prevention covid-19 prevencin coronavirus and prevencin covid-19 two reviewers hg-i and gj-t viewed the links independently and the following information was extracted from each link type of authorship official public health organizations scientific societies digital media libraries private health care system articles from biomedical journals or other language country of publication and recommendations to avoid covid-19 the information was obtained by making up to four clicks on the different sublinks of each link as has been done in other studies 1011 subsequently the degree of adherence to the following world health organization who basic protective measures against the new coronavirus in force on february 29 2020 was checked wash your hands frequently maintain at least 1 meter 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing avoid touching eyes nose and mouth cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze then dispose of the used tissue immediately stay home if you feel unwell if you develop fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical advice promptly call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel if you are healthy you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected covid-19 and wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing 12we performed a descriptive analysis of all the variables and evaluated the association of the independent variables type of authorship and country of publication with the degree of adherence to the who basic protective measures by means of a chi-square test or fisher exact test when a significant association was found p05 this was quantified with the odds ratio or and its 95 ci obtained from univariate logistic regression analysis the agreement between the two reviewers regarding the adherence to the who basic protective measures was analyzed using the kappa index all analyses were performed using spss v200 ibm corp and epiinfo centers for disease control and preventionin total 80 weblinks were reviewed textbox 1 most of them were produced in the united states and spain n58 73 by digital media and official public health organizations n60 75 table 1 there were no discrepancies between the authors regarding the degree of adherence to the who basic protective measures kappa1in addition information that was ambiguous or did not adhere to the who recommendations was found in 8 weblinks 5 from spain and 3 from the united states 6 of the 8 were from digital media in particular 3 spanish links indicated maintain a distance of approximately one meter between people one spanish link mentioned that for people without respiratory symptoms a surgical mask is not required although masks can be worn in some countries according to local cultural customs one link in spain and another in the united states specified that someone should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it one link in the united states mentioned if youre going to around a lot of sick people like if youre visiting a friend in the hospital a mask might be a good idea and one link in the united states recommended stay three feet away from people when you talk to themunivariate analysis by type of author official public health organizations versus digital media revealed statistically significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask if you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected covid-19 or 439 table 2 the analysis according to country of publication spain versus the united states detected statistically significant differences regarding some recommendations such as wash your hands frequently or 982 cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze or 459 or stay home if you feel unwell or031 table 3this study is the first to evaluate the adherence of the information available on the internet to the who basic protective measures against covid-19 it shows a level of adherence that can be improved and a difficulty in obtaining such information since it was only available in 325-813 of the linksthe difficulty of finding who-promoted measures to prevent other infectious diseases on the internet has also been described previously by other authors such as covolo et al 13 the authors when studying the information on the internet about the pandemic flu vaccine showed that only 803 6176 and 539 4176 of the websites they evaluated contained information on the indications and contraindications respectively of the vaccine that correctly adhered to the who guidelines 13less than half of the weblinks provided information on the correct use of masks and together with the fact that some of the links provided information that was ambiguous or did not adhere to the who guidance may have contributed to the misuse of masks by the population and with the subsequent shortage of these devices that is occurring worldwide 1415as with other studies that evaluated information on the internet on preventive measures for other infections 11 our work shows that in general official public health organizations provide more correct information on measures to avoid covid-19 which confirms what other authors have said about the reliability of the information provided by such institutions 1013 however the fact that only 34 n2780 of the links referred to such organizations is an aspect that could be improved and shows the need to implement some interventions to increase the number of links of this type and their visibility on the internet in addition digital media must take responsibility for providing correct information and creating comprehension among citizens 16according to the analysis by country the spanish links provided more information on measures to prevent covid-19 that adhered to the who than did the links produced in the united states the measures to prevent covid-19 by the centers for disease control and prevention 17 are the same as those of the who and the proportion of links with information that was ambiguous or did not adhere to these guidelines is similar in terms of originating in the united states n330 and spain n528 therefore an explanation for these differences could be that at the time of data collection covid-19 was considered to pose a moderate risk to public health in spain with 50 cases among 46 million people 18 while in the united states the problem was still far away with 66 cases among 327 million people 18 for this reason the links from the united states did not provide as much information as the spanish links on how to prevent covid-19one of the limitations of our study is intrinsic to the nature of internet namely that information changes continuously like others 510111319 this paper analyzed the information available at a particular time on the other hand as in previous studies on other infectious diseases 5 only the first 20 links obtained were evaluated because it has been observed that internet users only use the first two pages of results 20 likewise the search was carried out only with the google search engine because it is the most popular search engine covering nearly 90 of the total online searches 21 finally like other studies 1113 the search terms were chosen by the authors assuming that an internet user would probably use one of them to perform simple searches on the web with respect to preventative measures for covid-19in conclusion it is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations and specifically those originating from spain for spanish-speaking users when seeking information on covid-19 preventive measures on the internet in this way they will be able to obtain high-quality information more frequently and such websites accessibility and positioning may improve given that search engines justify the positioning of links obtained in a search based on the frequency of access to themfacemasks are recommended for diseases transmitted through droplets and respirators for respiratory aerosols yet recommendations and terminology vary between guidelines the concepts of droplet and airborne transmission that are entrenched in clinical practice recently are more complex than previously thought the concern is now increasing in the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic 1 the spread of respiratory viral infections rvis occurs primarily through contact and droplet routes and new evidence suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours 2 therefore the use of masks as appropriate personal protective equipment ppe is often considered when preventing the spread of respiratory infections experimental data shows that the micropores of mask block dust particles or pathogens that are larger than the size of micropores 3 for example the micropores of n95 masks materials are only 8 m in diameter which can effectively prevent the penetration of virions 45although the aforementioned studies support the potential beneficial effect of masks the substantial impact of masks on the spread of laboratory-diagnosed respiratory viruses remains controversial 6 smith et al indicated that there were insufficient data to determine definitively whether n95 masks are superior to surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers hcws against transmissible acute respiratory infections in clinical settings 7 another meta-analysis suggested that facemask provides a non-significant protective effect or  053 95 ci 016171

the physical barrier provided by a mask can effectively prevent the respiratory tract from contacting the outside virus thereby reducing the risk of respiratory virus infections 36 a recent study showed that sars-cov-2 can travel up to 4 m 13 feet from patients and be widely distributed on daily objects eg floors computer mice trash cans 37 surgical masks are able to reduce influenza virus rna in respiratory droplets and coronavirus rna in aerosols 38 the sars-cov-2 aerosol mainly appearing in submicron region d
p between 025 and 10 m and supermicron region d
p  25 m 39 can be effectively filtered out from the inhaled air by either surgical masks or n95 masks 340 comparison of the incidence of covid-19 in hongkong china with spain italy germany france us uk singapore and south korea showed that community-wide mask wearing may assist in controlling covid-19 with reduced emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from mildly symptomatic patients 41during the current covid-19 pandemic hcws are facing the dangers inherent in close contact with index-patients 42 in italy more than 2600 hcws have been infected by march 19 2020 accounting for 83 of the countrys total cases 43 according to our analysis wearing masks significantly reduced the risk of infection among hcws by 80 it is noteworthy that none of the 278 hcws wearing n95 masks in quarantined areas were infected by sars-cov-2 yet 10 of the 215 hcws who did not wear masks in the open areas were infected 35 therefore universal masking of hcws at clinical settings is likely to provide great benefits for hcws especially during current covid-19 pandemic moreover protective benefits were also reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct patients 33 besides sokols study also found a reduced risk of hospital-acquired rvis by putting surgical masks on all workers and visitors in every patient room on the bone marrow transplant unit 44 accumulative data showed that people with older age immunosuppressed state and systematic commodities are at higher risk for severe covid-19 infection 45 46 47 and therefore should be protected with proper measures eg prophylactic masking during the current pandemic in addition those who have close contact with those populations at high risks of contracting rvis should consider wearing masks as wellmore importantly our data showed that masks worn by non-hcws can also effectively prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and reduce the risk of virus infection by 56 in non-household settings indicating the potential benefits of wearing masks for the general public moreover significant protective effects were found in the study conducted in the general population 17 indicating the potential benefits of wearing masks for the general public interestingly a recent covid-19 dynamics modeling study suggested that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective non-medical grade social masks may meaningfully reduce the community transmission and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths during the current covid-19 pandemic 48 although laboratory-confirmed virus results show no difference between the mask group and the control group in a study investigating the wearing of masks by pilgrims wearing masks reduced the risk of influenza-like illness when people gather 4 this difference between laboratory-confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness cases were likely due to an under-diagnosis of real cases caused by too few nasal swabs collected for laboratory confirmation zhang et al conducted a case-control study and found that none of the passengers always wearing masks on an international flight were infected with h1n1 32 and a recent case report 49 described a man who was wearing a mask at international flight and then tested positive for covid-19 while 25 other people closest to him on the plane and flight attendants were all tested negative further demonstrating the benefits of wearing masks during public transportations 50protective effects were also found among household settings showing a 40 reduced risk of rvis however masking with prudent implementation and high compliance is a prerequisite to ensure the successful protection which is practically challenging especially for non-hcws two household studies included in our analysis reported low facemask adherence among household contacts 2324 which might explain the poor protective effects from these studies in contrast suess et al reported a good compliance which showed a significant protective effect 29 these findings implicated that proper use of masks has an impact on the effectiveness of preventing rvis given that most people in household settings were unlikely to strictly follow hand hygiene and mask use recommendations 23 re-evaluating the home quarantine strategy might be essential during the current covid-19 pandemic 5152the risk of influenza sars and covid-19 infection were reduced by 45 74 and 96 by wearing masks respectively which were consistent with previous meta-analyses during the sars outbreaks 953 the previous systematic review from xiao et al though reporting non-significant protection of masks against the influenza virus 6 did not strictly follow the prisma statement and represented merely non-aggregated data for example there was one study 54 included by xiao et al did not report a significantly protection by wearing masks however it should be noted that the result of this study was not convincing because the h1n1 pandemic broke out during the study period and the national hygiene campaign implemented at this time influenced all participants to wear masks 54the insignificantly reduced risk of h1n1 infection following masking could be partially explained by the relatively small sample size and multiple confounding factors eg prior vaccination hand hygiene age gender and culture jeager et al 2009 indicated that overall ppe use among hcws was low as more than 25 of hcws in this study reported they never used ppe in any patient encounter and only 17 reported wearing masks with every h1n1 patient encounter which could significantly lower the sample size of data collected 27 also the same study 27 indicated that the majority of hcws had received regular seasonal influenza vaccination which could play a role of confounding factor contributing to protective effects toward control group additionally during acute outbreak of h1n1 specific preventive measures were lagged behind h1n1 exposures this could suggest that hcws might already have been infected before wearing masks further decreasing the powers of data collecteddue to current controversial guidelines between different countries and areas regarding the general public wearing masks we also analyzed its effects based on different geographic locations showing that wearing masks does provide protective effects in both asian countries and western countries by 69 and 55 respectively among hcws it reduced the risk in both asian and western countries especially for non-healthcare populations reduced risk of 54 was found in western countries and a reduced risk of 49 was found in asia this would suggest that the proper use of masks might play a significant role in public health efforts to suppress the spread of rvis regardless of the geographic locations especially during an outbreakthe present meta-analysis still has several limitations first well-designed high-quality prospective studies and studies of masking in the general public are still insufficient second droplet-borne and airborne viruses are likely to cause large-scale transmissions among the passengers within closed transportation vehicles 55 however relevant studies are relatively rare 32 third this article included some studies of sars patients diagnosed according to clinical diagnostic criteria for sars due to a low detection rate of rt-pcr 56 the lack of sufficient virologic evidence may affect our conclusions however this effect might not be significant as 92 of patients with clinical sars for whom paired sera were available had a 4-fold rise in antibody titer to sars-cov 57 fourth control subjects without masking are generally lacking in studies conducted in healthcare settings mainly due to the ethical issue future studies might choose hcws from departments without needs of masking as controls 26 fifth our study didnt have sufficient data for subgroup analysis of different mask types since our inclusion criteria mainly focused on masks versus no masks which might inherently omit studies that focused on effectiveness of different mask types though there were published studies that had shown different specifications of masks and different wearing methods may affect the protective effect of masks 1732 and when the included studies divided the timefrequency of wearing masks we only included the group of masks with the longest wearinghighest wearing frequency this might also ignore effects of the shortinfrequent mask-wearing in addition the studies we included were mainly conducted in asia especially china and more evidence from other countries is needed to support our views last but not least information about other confounding biases such as vaccination hand hygiene age gender and culture may affect the protective effect of masksthe present meta-analysis showed the general efficacy of masks in preventing the transmission of rvis such protective effects of masking are evidentiary for both healthcare and non-healthcare workers and consistent between asian and western populations more evidences are still needed to better clarify the effectiveness of masking in various circumstancesthis work was not supported by any fundingwe declare no competing interestssince the beginning of the 21st century the outbreak of coronavirus has brought serious losses to society the most serious of which are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers in december 2019 a new coronavirus was found in wuhan hubei province china and spread rapidly across the country attracting global attention12from the existing epidemiological data the transmission speed of covid-19 is significantly faster than that of sars but its pathogenicity is remarkably weaker than that of mers and sars to control the epidemic the chinese government has formulated a series of social alienation strategies3 because of the strict blockade and quarantine measures the spread outside hubei province seems to be slowing down4 a large number of health care workers hcws from all over china rushed to hubei province to jointly fight against covid-19because of the strong transmission of covid-19 and the uncertainty of the infection status of patients hcws must provide personal protective equipment ppe5 ppe such as n95 masks latex gloves and protective clothing will often be worn for hours at a time there are not a few cases of adverse skin reactions related to the use of ppe by hcws6 however existing research on poor skin reactions to the use of ppe by hcws is limited the study collected the results of a survey of adverse skin reactions caused by the use of ppe by hcws in hubei province during the covid-19 outbreak combined with these results we can determine the prevalence and characteristics of adverse skin reactions caused by ppe among hcws in hubei province the findings of this study will help to determine whether long-term use of ppe poses significant occupational health risks and suggest possible solutionsthe purpose of this study is to explore the problem of adverse skin reactions among hcws who have been using ppe for a long period of time in hubei province this study uses the method of quantitative descriptive research as a descriptive research method quantitative descriptive research can not only analyze the samples qualitatively but can also combine qualitative and quantitative data obtained by statistics therefore quantitative descriptive research is considered appropriate in light of the fact that the purpose of this study is to explore the incidence of adverse reactions of hcws who have been wearing ppe for a long period of time a comprehensive summary is generated through quantitative descriptive design which clearly reflects adverse skin reactionsthis study uses a purposeful sampling method to select qualified research objects purposeful sampling methods can collect useful information needed for this study by identifying different participants based on this method we selected participants according to the following criteria registered doctors or nurses hcws fighting covid-19 in hubei province hospitals those often wearing ppe such as n95 masks latex gloves and protective clothing staff who are contacted with patients directly and those willing to participate in the questionnaire survey according to this standard we selected a total of 65 hcws who met the criteria table 1 summarizes the population statistics of the participantsall participants signed an informed consent form before the study the research scheme has been approved by the ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of chongqing medical university and is based on the ethical principles of medical research involving human objects in the helsinki declarationthis survey was conducted by the distribution of questionnaires to participants who met the criteria the questionnaire covers the duration of the use of masks gloves and protective clothing as well as adverse skin reactions caused by their use participants who agreed to participate in the study were asked to sign an informed consent form on the date of data collection finally a total of 61 valid questionnaires were collected to facilitate subsequent data analysis all questionnaires were collected and backed up to ensure that no data were lost during transcription and statistical analysisspss210 software spss inc chicago il was used for statistical analysis chi-square tests and two-sample t tests were used to compare the differences between groups a p-value of 05 was considered significanttrustworthiness is the criterion used to assess a study the trustworthiness of this study is maintained by 4 main criteria credibility confirmability transferability and dependability for credibility the content of the study is discussed between researchers and authors to determine the conclusions for confirmability participants were asked to verify the survey contents to ensure that their ideas were accurately reflected in the study for transferability a vivid and detailed description of the results and the research process were recorded the results and conclusions can be transferred to the study of similar fields for the dependability an in-depth and vivid description of the research methods was accurately recorded to show a comprehensive understanding of the research methods therefore future researchers can repeat this studyamong the 61 hcws who regularly used the n95 mask 58 951 reported adverse reactions including nasal bridge scarring 689 facial itching 279 skin damage 262 dry skin 246 and rash 164 seven workers had indentation and ear pain and 1 had acne six of them developed wheals on the bridge of the nose jaw and cheeks all people with skin reactions developed these reactions after using the n95 mask for 12 hours a day over an average of 35 months hcws using surgical masks cloth masks and paper masks did not report any adverse skin reactions table 2 lists the adverse reactions reported by the hcws surveyed who were using the n95 mask because of the strong transmission of covid-19 all 58 hcws continued to use the n95 mask despite their symptoms only 5 hcws sought treatment from doctors fifteen hcws took medicine on their own the others did not take any measures there was no significant difference in occupational adverse skin reactions however the proportion of women hcws with skin rash was significantly higher than that of men hcws most hcws with skin rashes were between 20 and 29 years old among hcws with skin damage the proportion of women was significantly higher than that of men most of the hcws with itching were concentrated in the age group between 20 and 29 years oldamong 61 workers who regularly used latex gloves 54 885 reported adverse skin reactions including dry skin 557 itching 312 rash 230 and chapped skin 213 three people had skin soaked with sweat and 1 had symptoms of edema table 3 lists the adverse reactions of using latex gloves reported by hcws who were surveyed for an average of 35 months latex gloves were used for an average of 10 hours no one reported that the use of plastic gloves and cloth gloves can cause adverse skin reactions five people switched to plastic gloves because of wheals while most of the participants continued to use latex gloves among the 5 people 1 switched to plastic gloves and 4 wore plastic gloves under their latex gloves of the 54 hcws 10 people sought treatment from doctors 5 people took medicine on their own and the others did not take any action there were no significant sex or occupational differences in adverse skin reactions however most of the hcws with dry skin were between 20 and 29 years old most of the hcws with itching were 20 to 29 years old hcws with chapped skin were older than those without chapped skin and most of them were between 30 and 39 years oldof the 61 hcws who regularly wore protective clothing only 37 607 reported adverse skin reactions including dry skin 361 itching 344 rash 115 and wheals 328 one person reported that protective clothing was airtight and led to the development of sweat herpes muggy heat was reported by other people one individual reported dampness table 4 lists the adverse reactions reported by hcws who used protective clothing the protective clothing used is disposable and is worn for an average of 10 hours a day for an average of 35 months given the strong transmission of covid-19 all hcws continue to use protective clothing regardless of symptoms two of the 37 people sought treatment from a doctor because of the symptoms of wheals while the others did not take any measures there was no significant difference in adverse skin reactions caused by occupation among the hcws with itching the proportion of women was significantly higher than that of men and the age of respondents was mostly between 20 and 29 years old the proportion of women hcws with itching was higher than that of men hcwsin order to release itching and rash we give some suggestions that are shown in the flowchart fig 1 these suggestions have been proved to be effective among hcws in hubeidue to the highly contagious and nationwide spread of covid-19 hcws across china who volunteer in hubei province are required to wear ppe such as n95 masks latex gloves and protective clothing5 the use of ppe may cause adverse skin reactions however existing studies on adverse skin reactions due to the use of ppe by hcws are limited in this case it is possible to study the adverse reactions caused by the use of ppe to propose solutions which can help hcws who are still fighting covid-19 to effectively reduce adverse skin reactions in the future this study may still be useful for hcws therefore i used a questionnaire to conduct a quantitative study to determine the incidence of adverse skin reactions caused by the use of ppe by hcws ultimately a total of 61 valid questionnaires were collected the results of the study showed that the most common adverse skin reactions among hcws using ppe included nasal bridge scarring facial itching skin damage dry skin rash chapped skin and whealsmedical masks are a kind of ppe that are used to prevent the spread of respiratory tract infections the mask can cover the mouth and nose of the wearer and if worn properly may effectively help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and bacteria7 during the sars outbreak in 2003 the who and the centers for disease control and prevention of the united states issued preventive measures in the care of sars patients suggesting that the time of exposure to air should be reduced to decrease the probability of airborne droplet transmission8 in particular it is recommended to use protective masks that meet the certification of the national institute of occupational safety and health n stands for the national institute of occupational safety and health and 95 indicates its filtering efficiency as a result the mask has a 95 filtration efficiency in filtering particles with a size of 300 nm the n95 mask can block 95 of the air particles and fits closely with the facial skin to prevent the inhalation of smaller infectious particles which can travel long distances through the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes diseases that require the use of the n95 mask include tuberculosis chicken pox sars and measles9 the diameter of sars-cov-2 is between 80 and 120 nm but when the virus is excreted from an infected person it will be wrapped in saliva to form larger droplets because the n95 mask can effectively filter out particles 300 nm in size it can effectively block the spread of sars-cov-26 hcws must wear masks for a long period of time every day because of the infectivity of covid-19 therefore it is necessary to detect adverse skin reactions using the n95 maskseries of researches have explored the related adverse reactions of hcws wearing n95 mask foo et al6 reported the most common adverse skin reactions were acne facial itching and rash furthermore headache was highlighted in lim research10 however there is no headache in the present study it probably because the participants in lim research have been wearing n95 mask for 1 year and the long-term utilization could result in hypoxemia and hypercapnia which led to headache in this study we found that the most common adverse reaction of the n95 mask was nasal bridge scarring followed by facial pruritus because the medical staff must have adequate personal protection they will tie the mask tightly and squeeze the metal clip hard to ensure the tightness of the mask therefore the scar on the bridge of the nose may be caused by the excessive pressure of the mask and the hardness of the metal clip the cause of itching may be discomfort due to wearing a mask for too long a period of a time combined with an excessively humid internal environment itching may also result from irritating contact dermatitis attributed to an allergic reaction to the mask material skin damage may be due to the excessive binding of the mask such that the edge of the mask is in close contact with the skin coupled with wearing the mask for a long period of time11in light of the above situations when wearing a mask hcws can reduce the intensity of binding to achieve moderate tightness gently pinch the metal clip at the bridge of the nose and add a surgical mask to line the inside of the n95 mask which can effectively reduce adverse skin reactionsit has been reported that covid-19 can be transmitted through contact so hand protection is one of the most important ways of preventing covid-19 infection5 wearing latex gloves can effectively prevent the chance of contact infection among hcws the most common adverse reactions to wearing latex gloves in this study were dry skin itching and rash it was similar to the skin adverse reactions of wearing gloves during sars6 there may be 3 reasons why these situations occur one is immunoglobulin e-mediated hypersensitivity to latex1213 the second is latex allergy14 and the third may be irritant contact dermatitis15 which arises from repeated hand washing with soap and detergent and not completely drying the hands therefore the inside of the glove will not be able to absorb air resulting in irritation if it is a dry powder glove it is likely to be caused by the stimulation of talcum powder in the gloves in this case it is necessary to rinse off the soap or detergent before putting on gloves and dry ones hands before wearing gloves if the gloves are dry there should not be too much talcum powder inside another solution is to wear a layer of plastic gloves inside the latex gloves these measures can prevent the occurrence of irritant dermatitis if the symptoms of irritant contact dermatitis cannot be resolved latex allergy testing is necessary and latex gloves should be avoided16hcws must wear protective clothing for a long period of time every day to protect themselves therefore adverse skin reactions have emerged the adverse skin reactions of hcws who have been using protective clothing are relatively less common the most common symptoms were dry skin and itching the main reason for these situations is probably due to the protective clothing being muggy and the need to wear it for a long period of time the frequent replacement of protective clothing can effectively reduce the occurrence of the above symptomsour study investigated the long-term use of ppe in hubei province and found that most hcws have adverse skin reactions when wearing masks gloves and protective clothing these adverse skin reactions are usually mild because most hcws continue to use the equipment therefore the wearer will not seek the help of a dermatologist or self-medicate in our study skin adverse reactions using ppe were mainly concentrated in itching and rash so we suggest that after the occurrence of adverse skin reactions second-generation antihistamines or glucocorticoids were recommended for hcws if any serious adverse skin reactions to ppe occurred or medicine administration was ineffective they should seek help from a dermatologist to date there have been no reports of adverse skin reactions caused by the use of ppe in covid-19 the adverse skin reactions of hcws reported in questionnaires cannot be verified by professionals as they are the subjective assessment of hcws nevertheless the study provides a perspective on the incidence of adverse skin reactions that can be caused by the long-term use of ppethere is no doubt that the threat of covid-19 worldwide remains uncontrollable and the possible solutions proposed in this study can help hcws who are still fighting covid-19 to effectively reduce adverse skin reactions this study may be useful to hcws in the futurexiang zhou contributed to the design overall planning and all-round

final manuscriptpersonal protective equipment ppe is an article used to prevent the wearer from coming in contact with hazardous infectious chemical radiological electrical and physical agents it contains components illustrated in figure 1 1 the surge in demand and misuse of ppe has led to an acute shortage of protective gear endangering the lives of healthcare workers 2 more than 9000 healthcare workers hcw in the united states us and more than 17000 in italy have been infected with covid-19 3-4 a total of 444 hcw in pakistan have been exposed to covid-19 as of april 29 2020 5 many doctors are performing their duty without any ppe and are at high risk of becoming infected 6 there have been peaceful protests all over the world by doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals demanding ppein the wake of the covid-19 pandemic ppe plays a significant role with face masks and gloves being the most essential doctors nurses and other frontline healthcare responders are using them to minimize the risk of contaminated contact or droplet exposure some studies suggest that the psychological impact of ppe is such that individuals using them might feel more protected than they actually are in reality 7 it should be ensured that the wearer practices hand hygiene before wearing and after removing the protective gear also an appropriate method for its disposal should be consideredis wearing ppe importantthe primary mode of transmission of coronavirus is known to be droplet or contact-based infected individuals are prone to spread the virus while coughing sneezing or speaking this micro virus when ejected can travel up to a distance of six feet wearing a face mask along with other precautionary measures like hand hygiene and self-isolation limits the transmission of infectious agents 8-9initially the usage of masks among the general public was highly controversial experts discouraged healthy people from wearing masks due to the scarce supply this equipment was reserved for those in direct contact with infected patients 10 however the rapid rise in the degree of local transmission has caused many countries to allow their citizens to wear non-medicalcloth masks along with practicing social distancing 9 11 evidence-based studies reveal that the concomitant use of household non-medical face masks as well as using a proper handwashing regimen reduces the probability of local transmission thereby decreasing the death toll 12 it should be noted that according to the world health organization who guidelines medical masks and respirators should only be reserved for healthcare workers 10 factors that determine the efficiency of face masks are listed in table 1 13types of masksthe main types of masks being used are respirators medical masks and non-medicalcloth masks respiratorsthese are protective equipment which provides an almost accurate facial fit and effective filtration of airborne particles they provide a proper seal around the mouth and nose providing optimal protection according to the recent who cdc and fda guidelines such masks are only reserved for healthcare providers 10 13-14 the fda has labeled these masks as single-use disposable devices however in cases of shortage in supplies these can be sterilized and reused 14 while the respirator masks are highly efficient they still do not provide complete protection improper and misuse of these masks can lead to the spread of infection in the user 15medical masksthese are thin pleated and disposable masks that protect the user from inhaling dust particles contaminated liquid droplets and bacteria they are usually two layers thick and made from unwoven fabric these masks only act as a physical barrier between the users nose and mouth and the infected environment they do not possess a proper seal and are less effective than respirators these are loose masks which allow comfortable breathing and reduce transmission probability 14non-medical masksaccording to recent studies asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus have been detected and can transmit the virus in the face of this discovery cdc experts recommend that the general public uses non-medicalcloth coverings to shield their mouth and nose these textile masks are made up of layers of cloth some of them also possess a paper towel layer which increases the filtration capability they do not offer full protection but along with other precautionary measures are useful to slow down the spread of coronavirus 16ppe per clinical settingas a general safety precaution every frontline healthcare worker hcw should know which ppe needs to be used in different clinical settings 17-181 under any clinical setting where there is a risk of getting infected the individual should don put on a medical face mask gloves gown and eye protection2 if the hcw is more than 2 meters away from the patient heshe should use a fluid-resistant medical face mask with or without eye and face protection depending on whether there is exposure to flashes or droplets3 in case of an ongoing aerosol-generating procedure agp all individuals present should wear a respirator face and eye protection gloves and long-sleeved fluid-repellent gown4 contact transmission can be avoided by wearing disposable gloves and gownsdonning and doffing ppe for infection preventionit is essential that every hcw should know the proper way to put on donning and remove doffing ppe any mistake in doing so can render the individual exposed to infections agents centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the ministry of health new zealand have introduced the proper way of handling ppe 19-20 hcw should wear the entire ppe before entering a patients room steps of donning and doffing are illustrated in figures 2-3decontamination and reuse of ppeaccording to standard infection prevention and control ipc guidelines ppe is a single-use disposable item however due to the current shortage of ppe health care providers are challenged to rationally use the limited supplies by decontaminating and reprocessing them it should be noted that there is no proven effectiveness of these practices and priority is given to the rapid manufacture of protective items 21 improper or inadequate decontamination of equipment before reuse is unsafe and can pose serious threats 22 when disinfecting ppe it is important to keep in mind the efficacy of the method used check for any residual toxicity and make sure that the functional integrity of the material is maintainedgeneral strategies include following the manufacturers guidelines to disinfect and reprocess the ppe routine inspection of protective material should be carried out along with the replacement of the equipment if the integrity is not maintained or it is damagedrespirators and medical masks1 usually cleaning prior to disinfection is required respirators and medical masks lose their protective property when they undergo cleaning2 considering the current conditions these items can be worn by a single hcw for multiple shifts factors such as humidity and shelf-life limit their use3 medical masks can be reprocessed using the environment protection agency epa-registered disinfectants4 filtering facepiece respirators can be decontaminated using vaporous hydrogen peroxide moist heat and bleach solution5 remember to replace these respirators if breathing is hinderedgowns1 submerge in hot water and detergent then thoroughly scrub the gown2 afterward soak in 005 chlorine solution for about 30 minutes3 rinse in clean water and ideally allow drying in the sun4 gowns having small holes and tears could be mended whereas worn out gowns should be discardeddisposable face shields1 clean first the inside and then the outside surface of the visor using a detergent-soaked clean cloth2 clean the outside of the visor with a clean cloth saturated with disinfectant3 wipe the outside of the visor with clean water4 use towels or dry air to completely dry the visorreusable goggles and face shields1 immerse in warm water and neutral detergent solution2 rinse with clean water3 wipe with disinfectant and then again rinse with clean water4 dry completely using towels or dry airproper disposal of ppepotentially infectious medical waste pimw such as covid 19 testing kits and ppe have a serious risk of coming in contact with infectious bodily fluids these materials should be kept safely on site hospitals testing centers in secure containers they should then transferred to storage facilities where they are disinfected and disposed of off to landfill sites 23 individuals responsible for waste management should take caution and should wear appropriate gear it is extremely critical to properly decontaminate and dispose of any waste material that could infect people who come in contact with itppe crisis strategythe escalating demand for ppe has given rise to new state and local strategies to ensure the careful optimization of available resources this policy helps reserve the reduced amount of ppe for the most critical conditions as the situation improves and the ppe supply is sufficient again the state can return to its conventional ppe guidelines the following strategies should be observed to overcome the shortage of ppe 24appropriate use of ppethere is a difference in the demand and supply of ppe with severe shortages in supply on all fronts it is crucial that all the equipment is used with care to prevent wastage to ensure a continuous supply of protective equipment despite limited production 1 221 the healthcare professionals who are working with patients of covid-19 and are in direct contact should have ppe consisting of gloves gowns masks face shields and goggles2 the same respirator can be used while examining multiple patients at a time since the shortage of supply is a fact in most places it is recommended to keep wearing a single one for multiple patients than to not have any respirator on3 hcw performing or assisting with invasive procedures should be wearing respirators eye protection like goggles and a face shield aligned with the gown and gloves if the gowns allow fluid to pass through an additional layer of protective coverage like an apron should be worn4 people who are taking care of the sick at home should be provided with medical masks at home for their own protection and to limit the spread of the disease5 individuals who remain asymptomatic or do not show any signs of illness can use non-medical masks and should not opt for medical masks inappropriate use of medical masks may increase the demand and can also impede the supply to professionals who need them the mostlimit the need for ppethe need for ppe can be minimized by the following interventions 251 limit patient contact and use alternate tools such as telemedicine for non-emergency cases2 make sure that no personnel who is not immediately needed for the patients care should enter the premise of the covid-19 ward that should be a separated and isolated area the visitors should either not be allowed at all or should have minimal contact with the patients3 all non-urgent proceduresappointments should be postponed4 ppe should be reused with proper decontamination guidelines5 ppe should be used beyond their shelf life making sure they are not worn out or damaged6 in the case of the absolute absence of ppe alternate methods for barrier control eg glass shields should be employedthese practices do not guarantee the absolute safety of healthcare professionals and their effectiveness is questionable however under the present circumstances these crisis strategies given by the cdc should be duly addressedcoordination between the supply and demand of ppethe supply should be monitored and demand adjusted 21 26 this can be done using the following methods1 use of rational quantification-based forecasts regarding ppe this helps in rationing available supplies to meet the demand2 the request for ppe from countries as well as major responders should be monitored and controlled the distribution of ppe to healthcare institutions should be controlled and monitored3 to avoid stock duplication a centralized request management system should be applied that takes notice of whether the stock management rules are being followed or not this helps in controlling the wastage and overstock4 keep a check on the end-to-end distribution of ppedue to the recent ease in lockdown measures and the commencement of the holy month of ramadan in the muslim world an abrupt rise in public gatherings is feared therefore it is highly critical that ppes should be used in all clinical and non-clinical settings citizens should use a cloth barrier while stepping out of the house and public gatherings should be strictly avoided the proper protocol should be followed when healthcare professionals consider reusing ppeas pakistan is one of the major distributors of ppe throughout the world it has set an exemplary approach during this pandemic the pakistani government and national disaster management authority ndma have made tireless efforts to increase the manufacturing and distribution of ppe moreover many non-governmental organizations ngos and medical students have come forward to combat this deadly disaster and distribute ppe to those fighting on the frontlinewith the emerging outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic millions of people throughout the world are staying at home to contain the spread of disease and contribute to flattening the curve associated with the rapid rise in the number of cases however healthcare professionals will not be staying home indeed they belong to a group of individuals who will be particularly vulnerable to contracting the infection dave et al

2020 in this context the occupational safety and health administration osha within the department of labor usa has developed an occupational risk pyramid which defines the risk of healthcare providers based on exposure httpswwwoshagovpublicationsosha3990pdf united states department of labour according to the osha dental healthcare providers dhcps are classified as very high risk for this reason the personal protective equipment ppe requirements for dhcps have been modified to include the wearing of impermeable gowns goggles or face shields and n95 or better respirators in addition to standard precautions meng et al 
2020the recommendation for a n95 respirator is unique for dentistry and requires a detailed discussion on its types alternatives donning and doffing techniques and fit testingaccording to the information available the most common transmission routes for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 or covid19 are through droplet transmission via direct facetoface contact between patients and dental healthcare providers dhcps coughing or sneezing and indirect transmission by touching surfaces that were contaminated by the virus and then touching face nose or eyes and through coarse or small droplets of saliva whilst performing aerosol generating procedures such as laryngoscopy or dental treatments peng et al 
2020 prati et al 
2020 the sarscov2 virus has an affinity for the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is in abundance in the respiratory tract and salivary gland duct epithelium and therefore the saliva is very likely to contain a high viral load liu et al 
2011 micik and colleagues were the first to define aerosols in dentistry as particles of size less than 50 m which were able to stay airborne for extended periods of time before eventually settling in the environment and or inhaled into the respiratory system micik et al 
1969 the particle size of 0510 m is of distinct importance as they are most likely to transmit infection micik et al 
1969 this has been validated by numerous studies and there is strong evidence which indicates that severe acute respiratory distress syndrome virus sars spreads through aerosol transmission it would be completely logical to assume that covid19 which is similar to sars can likewise spread through aerosols jones  brosseau 2015 centers for disease control and prevention httpswwwcdcgovsarsguidancei-infectionhealthcarehtml accessed 21 april 2020since the outbreak there is a lack of data comparing the efficacy of surgical mask versus respirators in mitigating the spread of covid19 virus however there is an abundance of published data comparing the two against the influenza virus and sars seto et al 
2003 teleman et al 
2004wen and colleagues tested the performance of various respirators and surgical masks against viral aerosols and demonstrated that the protection factor of n95 was thirty times greater than normal surgical masks wen et al 
2013 likewise the superiority of n95 over surgical masks has also been demonstrated against sars in a number of casecontrol studies seto et al 
2003 teleman et al 
2004conversely a recent systematic review and metaanalysis failed to demonstrate the superiority of n95 respirators over surgical masks during influenza pandemics long et al 
2020 the reasons suggested by the authors for the conflicting results were the high risk of bias in the randomized control trials low compliance of wearing the n95 respirator and frequent doffing as the respirator was uncomfortable to wear for longer periods of time long et al 
2020 to sum up faced with the emergence of a virulent disease such as covid19 it would be logical to use a respirator as it offers resistance to fluid penetration and forms a seal around the mouth and nose in contrast to surgical masks that provide barrier protection only against droplets including large respiratory particles most surgical masks lack an adequate face seal and do not effectively filter small particles from the air or aerosols allowing for leakage around the mask and subsequent exposure wen et al 
2013 furthermore the american dental association ada recommends an isolation of 14 days for both the dhcp and the patient if an aerosol generating procedure was performed using only a surgical mask andor a covid test be performed on the patient httpswwwadaorgenmember-centercoronavirus-resource-toolkit-for-ada-membersthere is a range of respirators including full and halfmask types the common types of respirators that are used in healthcare settings include halfmask filtering facepiece respirators ffrs and powered airpurifying respirators paprs since all dental guidelines recommend using ffrs they are discussed in greater detail chughtai et al 
2020 the most widely used ffrs are the n95 respirators which are disposable filtering facepiece respirators ffrs that tightly fit to provide optimum face seal and have a 95 or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 03 m bergman et al

fit testing is needed to determine whether a particular size and model of respirator provide an acceptable fit the benefit of the ffr will be negated if it does not form a tight seal around the face and nose therefore a process of individual fit testing is required osha respiratory protection standard 29 cfr 1910134 and this should be repeated periodically bergman et al 
2015 there are two types of fit tests available which include qualitative and quantitative teststhe qualitative test is graded as adequate if the test subject does not detect the sweet or bitter taste of saccharin or bitrex a solution containing 95 water 5 sodium chloride and  01 denatonium benzoate respectively whilst performing a series of test exercises whilst the quantitative fit test is done by using ambient aerosols to numerically estimate how well the n95 fits the user by measuring the aerosol particle ratio outside c
o and inside c
i the device nonetheless studies demonstrate that fit testing with either method provides the expected levels of protection shaffer  janssen 2015 studies have shown that varying pass rates for fit tests range from 10 to 80 indicating that one size does not fit all mcmahon et al 
2008 winter et al 
2010 huh et al 
2018to date there have been hundreds of approved n95 models that are available and it is difficult to predict which type of respirator will be the best fit in a given population a fit testing programme is recommended for dental healthcare providers in which the selection of the most suitable model should be made by an experienced fit tester who would determine the best fit based on facial dimensions ethnicity and appearance of fit these recommendations have proven to be useful in the past mcmahon et al 
2008 wilkinson et al 
2010 danyluk  hon 2011correct donning and doffing procedures are the key to use of ppe and all efforts should be made to prevent contamination during wearing and removal of respirators therefore stringent surveillance on proper ppe use is critical for preventing disease transmission to healthcare workers previous studies show poor adherence with donning and doffing protocols lead to selfcontamination beam et al 
2011 casanova et al 
2016 there are no universally accepted donning and doffing sequences but having a check list or instructions figs 1 and 2 are useful having full body mirrors for selfassessment and external observers have also proven to be helpful in preventing selfcontamination aguilar  linsuwanont 2011respirators are meant for single use only however reuse may be allowed in a crisis situation to conserve resources the covid19 virus is able to survive on plastic stainless steel and cardboard for up to 72 h van doremalen et al 
2020 therefore there is a chance that the outer surface of respirators could become contaminated with aerosol which can later be transferred to the user during donning and doffing procedures ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi vaporous hydrogen peroxide vhp and moist heat are the most promising decontamination procedures but there are is no literature which supports their efficacy against covid19 nevertheless caution is advised as decontamination procedures can have negative impact on the respirator performance as well as the fit of the respirator it is also recommended to contact the vendor for best decontamination practices bergman et al 
2010 aguilar  linsuwanont 2011 van straten et al 
2020it is essential to use ffrs during the pandemic of covid19 to prevent aerosol and droplet transmission as they are proven to offer resistance against fluid penetration and forms a seal around the mouth and nose better than surgical masks the success of any ffr in preventing the inhalation of contaminant particles is also subject to an acceptable fit test and proper donning and doffing the most commonly used ffr is the n95 respirator to prevent the transmission of diseasethe authors have stated explicitly that there are no conflicts of interest in connection with this articlethe rapid global spread of the coronavirus disease covid-19 has compelled national governments to issue guidance on the use of face masks for members of the public growing evidence of transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals makes the development of these guidelines increasingly pressing 1-3 recent research suggests that surgical masks could help prevent transmission of human coronaviruses by reducing emissions of coronavirus rna in respiratory droplets and aerosols 4 although n95 respirators have the potential for even greater protection when compared to surgical masks 56 they also require fit testing that make them unsuitable for the public at large 7 currently both surgical masks and n95 respirators are in short supply with health care workers continuing to face shortages of personal protective equipment ppe in light of this fabric masks have become a third masking option although current evidence on their efficacy is limited prior studies suggest that fabric masks are significantly less effective than surgical masks both for protecting health care workers and for reducing spread among the general public 89 even with lower efficacy however all masking options appear to hold value recent modeling suggests that widespread public adoption of even relatively ineffective masks would be able to help curtail community transmission of covid-19 although more effective masks yield greater reductions in mortality 10despite growing evidence on the value of masking and calls for public use of masks as part of a broader strategy that also includes social distancing and hand washing 1011 recent commentary suggests that public guidance on masks may be inconsistent across nations 12 and the world health organization who maintains as of may 2020 that masks are only needed for healthy individuals when they are taking care of someone with suspected covid-19 13 given the pandemic status of covid-19 it is critical to establish a baseline understanding of current government guidelines on mask use for the general public to date no studies have conducted a systematic analysis of mask guidelines aimed at the public public-facing guidelines are critical to compliance since government provision of cues is an important driver of mask use 14 agency websites are a particularly critical way to disseminate these types of guidelines as the public increasingly turns to the internet for health informationto inform this discussion and help health agencies to adopt rational recommendations on appropriate face mask use 12 this paper presents a content analysis of health agency mask guidelines in march 2020 among countries and regions with large numbers of covid-19 casesthe 25 countries and regions with the highest number of confirmed covid-19 cases were drawn from the johns hopkins center for systems science and engineering coronavirus covid-19 global cases tracker on march 9 2020 15 these countries and regions are listed in table 1 to replicate the experience of someone looking for guidance we visited national health agency websites for each country and region seeking mask guidelines medical surgical and unspecified mask types aimed at the public given limited evidence for their efficacy relative to surgical and medical masks 89 we considered fabric masks separately specifically we sought to find both recommendations for or against fabric masks for primary use and recommendations for fabric masks only when other more effective masks are unavailable a content analysis approach was used 16 and a codebook was developed in excel microsoft corporation to track guidance on when masks are recommended or not recommended initial coding suggested that several nations indicated that masks were not recommended because they may increase risks or create a false sense of safety a code was also added to track these statements countries were assigned across the coding team by language proficiency with google translate used as needed when available both the original and english language version of guidance were reviewed all relevant webpages and documents were downloaded to create a static record websites were coded between march 13 and march 23 2020 with all coding verified by a second coder the following week any coding discrepancies were discussed among authors and resolved all websites were revisited a final time on march 30 to look for updated materials and coding was updated as neededall 25 countries and regions had some form of publicly available information about masks on their health agency websites aimed at the public format and level of detail ranged greatly and included infographics eg malaysia and short responses in a frequently asked questions format eg netherlands iraq had the vaguest guidance which the coding team inferred from news stories and press releases about mask use rather than the existence of a formal page or document with public covid-19 prevention guidance a total of 4 16 countries and regions lacked recommendations for wearing surgical medical or unspecified masks when symptomatic and 12 48 countries did not mention use by individuals providing care during home quarantine table 1 although 9 36 countries and regions recommended surgical medical or unspecified masks in public or poorly ventilated places 16 64 explicitly recommended against the general public wearing masks a total of 7 28 also noted that surgical medical or unspecified masks were not recommended because they could increase health risks to the wearer or give a false sense of securitywith regard to fabric masks no countries or regions recommended this mask type as preferable to surgical or medical masks in the table 1 scenarios out of the 25 countries and regions there was a country and a region n2 8 that explicitly recommended against them due to their protective capacity being either unknown italy or inadequate hong kong south korea and mainland china recommended fabric masks as part of a broader guidance of different mask types being appropriate for different risk scenarios south korea for example noted in cases where there is not a high risk of infection or there is no health mask it is helpful to use a cotton mask including replacing the electrostatic filter to avoid droplets directly from coughing or sneezing germany the united states and japan recommended some form of fabric mouth covering including scarves and handkerchiefs only when other options were unavailable austria was the only country or region at the time of analysis to recommend fabric masks interchangeably with other types of masks noting that a textile mouth-nose guard can also be used as part of guidance on mask use in public spaces the remaining 17 68 countries and regions did not explicitly address fabric masks in their guidancein some cases countries or regions updated their guidance during the study period for example iranian guidance initially recommended asymptomatic individuals not wear masks by march 29 2020 additional guidance was posted recommending masks at the park gym or when engaging in urban travel on march 30 austria removed guidelines referencing the who that stated that disposable face masks are not an effective protection and instead recommended protective masks in public spaces where there may be close contact with other people eg in supermarkets by contrast sweden scaled back guidance during the study period removing language that masks could help prevent spread from symptomatic individualsas of late march 2020 there was little consistency in guidance on face mask use for the public despite covid-19 being declared a global pandemic although the countries and regions analyzed were chosen in light of having the highest number of confirmed cases in early march 2020 per-capita rates varied considerably accordingly some of the variation in guidance could be due to countries or regions being in different stages of pandemic response guidance may also be informed by strategic considerations related to ppe shortages and a desire to reserve masks for health care providers however variation in statements regarding mask risks suggest a more fundamental difference in assessments of masks as an appropriate approach for reducing community spread of covid-19 many differences also appear to be regional with the exception of austria only asian and middle eastern nations and regions recommend masks of any type in public as of march 30 2020 this is also broadly consistent with greater mask use in asian nations during previous outbreaks such as h1n1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome 1718 several european countries also failed to outline guidelines consistent with the who recommendation that symptomatic individuals and those who care for them should wear masksthe united states in particular has struggled with face mask guidelines in early march 2020 the us surgeon general issued a strongly worded tweet indicating that members of the public should not purchase masks in response to the spread of covid-19 suggesting both that masks would be ineffective and that they are needed by health care providers 19 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc also consistently advised the public not to use face masks unless sick or caring for someone sick and denied that any updated mask guidance was scheduled as of march 28 2020 20 on april 3 2020 the cdc updated its website guidance to recommend that the public wear fabric masks in public settings where social distancing is a challenge 21 the following day the us surgeon general posted a video on twitter demonstrating how to make a face mask out of a t-shirt 22 guidelines also specify that they are not recommending surgical masks as these are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders 21 at the time of writing us states continue to face shortages of ppe 23 and the cdc recommends medical use of bandanas and scarves as a last resort 24 the united states should monitor the efficacy of its guidelines relative to those in other nations and regionsas illustrated by the us example guidelines are constantly evolving in light of new risk information and mask availability although the ability to shift guidelines is critical to ensure that they reflect current evidence changes also pose distinct health communication challenges for example some members of the public may struggle to understand why universal mask use is encouraged if the previous message focused on masks posing a health risk misinformation about mask use already appears to be circulating on social media 25 research on understanding and receptivity to mask guidance will be critical most recently several countries in addition to the united states appear to be rethinking the value of fabric masks for example both iran and greece now provide online instructions for how to create a fabric mask at home 2627 it will remain important to maintain awareness of developments in mask guidelines across regions and nations given that covid-19 is not bound by political and legal borders it is also imperative that mask guidelines are clearly communicated to the public with messages explaining any guideline changesfindings on mask guidance should be interpreted in the context of their limitations and recognition that the sample focused on countries and regions with high levels of covid-19 in early march 2020 although we sought to assign coding based on language proficiency some countries and regions necessitated more reliance on google translate than others this may have introduced some translation errors some nations and regions may have communicated information via social media that was not present on their website and therefore not included in this analysis finally mask guidance does not necessarily imply mask access and the availability of masks for public use is a separate question that warrants significant attention from researchers and policy makersalthough covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the who on march 11 2020 28 guidelines for face mask use to prevent covid-19 in the public remained broadly inconsistent across nations and regions at the end of march 2020 efforts should be made to continue to monitor mask recommendations and create greater standardization based on scientific evidence furthermore there is a strong need for additional research on the efficacy of different mask types in community settings although not the primary focus of this study the clarity of guidelines was also a source of concern with some guidelines spread across multiple pages and sometimes not specifying the type of mask recommended further as mask use begins to increase in nations and regions where face masks have not experienced cultural assimilation18 it will be critical to expand guidelines to include not just when masks should be worn but also how they should be worn future research should consider how to best communicate such guidelines to the public particularly as guidelines continue to change over timein january 2020 the chinese center for disease control and prevention identified multiple patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan hubei as cases of coronavirus disease 2019covid-19 1 common clinical symptoms of patients with covid-19 include fever fatigue and dry cough occasionally accompanied by nasal congestion runny nose sore throat and diarrhea 23 covid-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets or direct contact 3 4 5 and shows strong human-to-human transmissibility covid-19 was classified as a class b infectious disease and should be implemented prevention and control measures applied to class a infectious diseases 67 as this epidemic broke around the chinese new year when population mobility is high it resulted in a high risk that a large number of people may become virus carriers which led to difficulties in identifying and controlling the source of infection therefore the lack of effective prevention and control measures for nosocomial infections in crowded areas of general hospitals such as outpatient clinics or wards can easily give rise to nosocomial outbreaks the hospital had clear standards for the protection and management of fever clinics and isolation wards but there were no clear standards and procedures for the protection of non-isolated areas in hospitals refined management is both a management concept and a management method based on digitization wherein information technology is professionally and systematically employed to achieve the goal of improving management efficiency and management quality 89 to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare professionals our hospital adopted refined management strategies for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections in non-isolated areas and no hospital-acquired infections were foundunder the guidance of the infection control department the nursing department and the medical department have jointly formulated protection measures for different types of staff for prevention and control of covid-19 as well as the prevention and control measures for the outpatient clinic the emergency department wards and administrative office areas table 1
infrared temperature screening was performed on all personnel including patients families and staff at the nine major entrances to the hospital mask-wearing was checked for all personnel and masks would be issued if necessary rapid hand sanitizer stations were installed to encourage hand hygiene individuals with an infrared body temperature 38 c or ear temperature 375 c were accompanied by staff to the fever outpatient clinicoutpatient appointments were scheduled to control the flow of patients further nosocomial infection control was strengthened including triage management and disinfection before and after each contact with patients triage nurses checked whether patients and their families wore masks correctly and assisted to correct if necessary a form was used to screen patients epidemiological history of covid-19 whether the patient had been to hubei province or had come into contact with someone from hubei in the last two weeks and feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms patients with an epidemiological history and feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms and patients with fever alone were escorted by staff to the fever outpatient clinic for further examination patients with an epidemiological history but without feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms went to designated clinics and maintained a distance of at least 1 meter from each other medical equipment such as stethoscopes thermometers sphygmomanometers etc was disinfected following each use the surfaces of hospital beds treatment tables and chairs treatment carts etc and the floor were wiped and disinfected with 1000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant once every 4-hour visible contamination was disinfected and wiped immediately with 1000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant the respiratory outpatient clinic was moved to a separate well-ventilated area with the same screening procedures at other outpatient clinicseducation related to prevention and control of covid-19 was carried out educational materials were posted at the pre-hospitalization preparatory center entrances towards and within each ward emphasis was placed on informing patients to reduce and control the number of visitors practice proper hand hygiene and wear the mask correctly a screening form was used to screen inpatients epidemiological history of covid-19 and respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms patients with an epidemiological history accompanied by feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms were transferred to the fever outpatient clinic patients with a positive epidemiological history but without feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms underwent proper droplet isolation visitors were not allowed to enter wards necessary accompanying persons should be fixed after passing screening of the epidemiological history wearing a mask and practicing hand hygiene during the accompanying period and avoid eating or sharing tableware with patients the distance between the beds of admitted patients was more than 1 metera screening station was set up at the entrance to the emergency department nurses checked and guided patients and their families on proper mask-wearing and recorded the epidemiological history of them triage nurses evaluated whether patients had feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms for patients with an epidemiological history accompanied with feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms it was determined whether they needed emergency rescue if emergency rescue was needed the patient was immediately sent to the isolation room in the emergency department otherwise the patient was escorted by a designated person wearing a surgical mask to the fever outpatient clinicall hospital staff received screening and completed the recording of epidemiological history related to covid-19 staff with an epidemiological history had to be quarantined at home followed up by the healthcare department until being confirmed without infection everyone entering the hospital administrative offices should be checked on wearing masks correctly and screened body temperatures using infrared thermometers by security staff the head of each administrative department checked twice a day if any member within the department showed feverrespiratorygastrointestinal symptoms all suspected status was reported to the healthcare departmentthe training team consisted of one head nurse and fourteen backbone members for nosocomial infection prevention and control the team produced systematic training materials including covid-19-related information videos on the use of protective equipment and labels for different hospital areas they also collected the latest information on covid-19 and its prevention and control measures video conferences were held to deliver group teaching in the form of live interactive network classrooms which were combined with on-site guidance to achieve better outcomes 10 participants in the training were registered in real-time through the office system and it was mandatory for all staff to participate and pass the entire course personnel trained included doctors nurses administrative and logistics staff cleaning and delivery staff and security staffthe education group consisted of one head nurse and four charge nurses who were responsible for producing educational material for patients and their families the educational materials included a version for patients and their families in general wards a version for fever clinic and isolation ward patients and an ipad version of the covid-19 prevention manual the nursing units posted notices and posters distributed covid-19 prevention manuals used multimedia tools such as videos and ppts combined with demonstrations on-site inspections and error corrections to educate the patients and their familiesthe supervision team consisted of one head nurse and six senior nurses who were responsible for formulating the audit forms for different areas and conducting daily on-site audits supervision and guidance of nursing units to implement the various prevention and control measures in addition through analysis and feedback of existing problems the team also made timely improvements to the prevention and control measures to achieve a systematic management process the supervision team developed an audit plan and audit content form conducted daily on-site spot checks to ensure the prevention and control measures were being implemented by personnel in the gridded areas strengthened on-site training for existing problems and analyzed and recorded the causes provided feedback for improvement via the office software group the supervision ways included a daily 10-min on-site audit of infrared temperature measurement and mask-wearing at each hospital entrance and recording the number of audited people and the existing problems on-site audits to check whether covid-19 prevention notices have been clearly displayed in all areas and to record the concentration of disinfection solution frequency of disinfection and compliance on-site audits to check whether patients and their families were aware of proper mask-wearing technique hand hygiene practice and covid-19 prevention measures and to record the frequencies of patients wearing masks correctly complying with hand hygiene instructions and being aware of covid-19 prevention measures when outpatients and their accompanying persons leave the outpatient clinics and when inpatients and their accompanying persons leave the wards spot checks on completion of the covid-19 epidemiological history screening form in each outpatient clinic and all wardswhen faced the epidemic a lot of work of communication coordination and reporting has to be done in hospitals due to the transmission characteristics of the covid-19 our hospital canceled centralized staff meetings the hospitals office software was used to form groups at different levels such as a core group of the nursing department for covid-19 prevention and control a group for heads of nursing units and groups for nursing unit members such that everyone could take responsibility and communicate effectively as closed-loop communication of important information was required video conferences were held when necessary collective sessions for patient education were canceled instead educational material was distributed via wechat while ipads and televisions in the ward were used to disseminate information on covid-19 prevention and control measuresthe workload of the emergency department clinics and inpatients wards the status of personnel screening the workload of each functional group and audit results were reported in the form of digital data the nursing department summarized these results to analyze the existing problems and make improvement of qualityas of january 31 2020 there was no hospital-acquired covid-19 infection among hospital staff the audit results are shown in table 2
 the rates of mask-wearing screening of epidemiological history and disinfection of environmental and medical supplies were all 100 in the hospital the accuracy rate of mask-wearing by patients and their families was 7379 while their compliance rate with hand hygiene was 4078for prevention and control of covid-19 in non-isolated areas of the hospital it is important to follow the concept of refined management refined management is a concept but also a management approach to achieve precision for the professional formulation of management standards refinement for systematic and comprehensive implementation stringency for rapid and effective communication to reduce the deviation in the implementation process and accuracy for digitized resultsepidemiological screening is the first step in epidemic prevention and control and cutting off the transmission route is one of the key steps nurses are the windows through which patients seek medical treatment as well as the main source of information for patients and their families and in charge of environmental disinfection thus nurses play an important role in epidemiological screening of covid-19 and implementing the control measures to cut-off the transmission of covid-19 the audit results indicate that the screening rate of epidemiological history for inpatients and outpatients was more than 95 the patients and their families awareness of covid-19 prevention and control measures was up to 975 the rate of mask-wearing at hospital entrances education and notification of patients and their families and the rate of environmental and medical supplies disinfection was 100 this indicates that the refined management method applied in our hospital ensured the effective implementation of covid-19 prevention and control measuresproper mask-wearing and hand hygiene are key points to cut off the transmission of covid-19 the audit results indicated that the rate of proper mask-wearing in medical areas was only 7370 the main problem was that the mask hung from one ear or shifted downwards the hand hygiene compliance rate when exiting clinics or wards was only 4078 an analysis of the causes revealed that this was highly associated with the publics daily habits and some patients reported chest tightness and discomfort when wearing a mask therefore it is necessary to increase publicity and supervision efforts around mask-wearing and hand hygiene practicethe prevention and control of the covid-19 epidemic are still ongoing and the majority of healthcare professionals are putting in their greatest efforts scientific and effective prevention in the non-isolated areas of general hospitals coupled with strict control and treatment in the fever isolation department are the two vital aspects to win this battleethical approval or individual consent was not applicable

to the editorthe covid-19 pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has sounded danger alarms across the globe according to a report by the world health organization who 292142 confirmed cases had been identified worldwide as of march 21 20201 although some differences in the real-world mortality rate and the mortality rate were reported in a few published clinical series a total of 1772 deaths with an average mortality rate of 25 was reported by the chinese center for disease control and prevention on february 16 20202 with the rise in global anxiety the who declared covid-19 the sixth international public health emergency on january 30 2020 this pandemic could have devastating outcomes across the world if the viral spread is not controlled by public health effortsthe origin of coronavirus a single-stranded enveloped rna virus dates back in 1960s the first coronaviruses discovered caused infectious bronchitis in chickens two other viruses obtained from nasal secretions of human patients with common colds were named human coronavirus 229e and human coronavirus oc43 subsequently other members of this family have been identified including sars-cov in 2003 hcov nl63 in 2004 hku1 in 2005 mers-cov in 2012 and sars-cov-2 formerly named 2019-ncov in 20193 most of these virus species cause severe respiratory infections in humansoverall the clinical features of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 correspond to common influenza the clinical manifestations of covid-19 pneumonia as demonstrated by some studies have varied among cases fever is the predominant symptom followed by cough dyspnea myalgia headache and diarrhea1 an effective cure of covid-19 by antiviral therapy and vaccination is currently being developed however considering previous management plans for mers and sars infections the who has recommended preventive measures to inhibit the transmission of acute respiratory infections these interventions include 1 avoiding close contact with people suffering from common cold 2 frequent cleaning of hands with running water or alcohol sanitizers 3 avoiding excessive touching of eyes nose and mouth and 4 avoiding unprotected contact with animals in addition people with acute respiratory infections should practice respiratory hygiene regularly which includes maintaining a distance of 1 m from healthy people to avoid spread of airborne droplets covering coughs and sneezes with clothing or disposable tissues and frequent hand washing1
since the emergence of sars-cov-2 various international bodies have debated the use of n95 respirators and surgical masks in their review on the use of masks and respirators for prevention of influenza transmission reza et al4 reported that effectiveness of masks is likely linked to their early regular and correct use most studies have reported a reduced risk of upper respiratory infections with masks and respirators similarly jefferson et al5 reviewed the clinical effectiveness n95 respirators 95 and masks 68 in reducing the spread of respiratory viruses in a debate organized by the singapore infection control association dr lin proposed the adequacy of surgical masks for prevention of mers-cov transmission in addition to personal and environmental hygiene moreover during sars outbreak n95 respirators were perceived to be difficult to tolerate by healthcare workers due to their association with impaired mental performance and headache according to professor seto the who has recommended the use of surgical masks for people living with infected patients and n95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures in 2009 the us cdc recommended the use of n95 respirators in all circumstances however with evolution of coronavirus pandemics the guidelines were revised in 2010 and n95 respirators were recommended only for aerosol-generating procedures6 with increasing global apprehension concerning the spread of coronaviruses people are rushing to amazon and local pharmacies to buy surgical masks and n95 respirators resulting in a shortage different social media celebrities are also promoting a dangerous myth by unnecessarily using these masks considering that n95 respirators filter out 95 of small particles medical professionals need to wear these masks during close contact with patients however they are of no use for general public because these heavy particles can be transmitted through surfaces and to a limited extent through air in a recent press conferences alex azar issued a statement that the united states needs 300 million n95 respirators for healthcare workers due to the rapid increase in prevalence of this infection7 the paucity of masks and respirators has led to significant price escalation some businesses in united states are completely sold out of masks despite evidence that healthy people do not need to wear them8
according to the centers for disease control and prevention frequent hand washing with running water and soap for at least 20 seconds using hand sanitizer avoiding large gatherings and crowds and disinfecting fomites may primarily protect others from the virus however the eminent global shortage and high prices of masks cannot be overstated the respective authorities and governments need to develop and implement the proper guidelines and preventative strategies and make sure that the general public is adhering to the proposed protocols governments should also provide accurate information and should clarify misinformation spread by social media to help the public face this pandemicsince the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus that caused coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the use of face masks has become ubiquitous in china and other asian countries such as south korea and japan some provinces and municipalities in china have enforced compulsory face mask policies in public areas however chinas national guideline has adopted a risk-based approach in offering recommendations for using face masks among health-care workers and the general public we compared face mask use recommendations by different health authorities panel
 despite the consistency in the recommendation that symptomatic individuals and those in health-care settings should use face masks discrepancies were observed in the general public and community settings1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 for example the us surgeon general advised against buying masks for use by healthy people one important reason to discourage widespread use of face masks is to preserve limited supplies for professional use in health-care settings universal face mask use in the community has also been discouraged with the argument that face masks provide no effective protection against coronavirus infectionpanelrecommendations on face mask use in community settings

there is not enough evidence to prove that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduces a healthy persons risk of becoming infected while wearing it according to who wearing a mask in situations where it is not recommended to do so can create a false sense of security because it might lead to neglecting fundamental hygiene measures such as proper hand hygiene
however there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce as acknowledged in recommendations from the uk and germany7 8 however face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections it would be reasonable to suggest vulnerable individuals avoid crowded areas and use surgical face masks rationally when exposed to high-risk areas as evidence suggests covid-19 could be transmitted before symptom onset community transmission might be reduced if everyone including people who have been infected but are asymptomatic and contagious wear face masksrecommendations on face masks vary across countries and we have seen that the use of masks increases substantially once local epidemics begin including the use of n95 respirators without any other protective equipment in community settings this increase in use of face masks by the general public exacerbates the global supply shortage of face masks with prices soaring9 and risks supply constraints to frontline health-care professionals as a response a few countries eg germany and south korea banned exportation of face masks to prioritise local demand10 who called for a 40 increase in the production of protective equipment including face masks9 meanwhile health authorities should optimise face mask distribution to prioritise the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable populations in communities who are more susceptible to infection and mortality if infected including older adults particularly those older than 65 years and people with underlying health conditionspeople in some regions eg thailand china and japan opted for makeshift alternatives or repeated usage of disposable surgical masks notably improper use of face masks such as not changing disposable masks could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infectionconsideration should also be given to variations in societal and cultural paradigms of mask usage the contrast between face mask use as hygienic practice ie in many asian countries or as something only people who are unwell do ie in european and north american countries has induced stigmatisation and racial aggravations for which further public education is needed one advantage of universal use of face masks is that it prevents discrimination of individuals who wear masks when unwell because everybody is wearing a maskit is time for governments and public health agencies to make rational recommendations on appropriate face mask use to complement their recommendations on other preventive measures such as hand hygiene who currently recommends that people should wear face masks if they have respiratory symptoms or if they are caring for somebody with symptoms perhaps it would also be rational to recommend that people in quarantine wear face masks if they need to leave home for any reason to prevent potential asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission in addition vulnerable populations such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions should wear face masks if available universal use of face masks could be considered if supplies permit in parallel urgent research on the duration of protection of face masks the measures to prolong life of disposable masks and the invention on reusable masks should be encouraged taiwan had the foresight to create a large stockpile of face masks other countries or regions might now consider this as part of future pandemic plans

main transmission routes of sars-cov-2 include droplet and contact transmissions airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures agp are performed world health organization 2020c although the virus nucleic acid could be detected in fecal specimens there has been no public reports on fecal-oral transmission yet xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a since the droplet could enter susceptible mucosal surface within a certain distance usually less than 1 m daily face-to-face talk breathing cough and sneezing may result in droplet transmission from respiratory tract the droplet can further form aerosols which are able spread to a wider range 1 m with the air currents and survive for a longer time in the environment for example a confirmed case took a bus for 2 h led to the infections of 7 people and there was no direct contact among them implying the possibility of aerosol transmission luo et al 2020 it has been found that sars-cov-2 could remain viable in aerosols for 3 h and is more stable on plastic 72 h stainless steel 48 h copper 4 h and cardboard 24 h surfaces van doremalen et al 2020 with the presence of symptomatic patients their surrounding surfaces eg air outlet fans toilet bowl sink door handle etc could be contaminated ong et al 2020 this was confirmed by the finding that sars-cov-2 nucleic acid was detected in environmental samples in huanan seafood market in wuhan china xinhua net 2020 similarly sars-cov-2 rna was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected cases up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the diamond princess cruise ship moriarty et al 2020 the aerosol deposition on the surface and subsequent resuspension could also be a potential transmission route in an sars-cov-2 aerosol study in wuhan china high viral rna concentration was observed inside the patient mobile toilet room 19 copies m3 and medical staff areas 1142 copies m3 in makeshift hospital in particular the viral rna concentration in protective apparel removal rooms was high 1842 copies m3 until the number of medical staff reduced or more rigorous sanitization processes were implemented liu et al 2020 also transmission of sars-cov-2 via air conditioning system is plausible in a study of reproductive number estimation of covid-19 on the diamond princess cruise ship zhang et al pointed out that aerosol transmission via the central air conditioning system might be neglected because of high r0 under the quarantine measures zhang et al 2020b an earlier study also revealed the possibility of coronavirus spread via air conditioner du et al examined sars-cov in samples using routine reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr and found that all dust samples and half of condensation water samples from the air conditioners were positive du et al 2005another important feature of the covid-19 is that asymptomatic cases proportion is high it is estimated approximately 60 of all infections convert from cases with mild symptom or asymptotic cases and might be passing the virus on to others qiu 2020 of the confirmed cases in diamond princess cruise ship approximately 179 of infected people never developed symptoms leading to high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew mizumoto et al 2020 this proportion echoes with the finding of an epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 close contacts in ningbo china that 167 of infected cases were asymptomatic chen et al 2020 the proportion of asymptomatic cases was estimated to be 1638 and 2756 in hubei and other provinces in china respectively data from china cdc the transmission rate of undocumented infections those who undergo mild limited or no symptoms and hence go unrecognized was 55 of documented infections 4662 due to high quantity and undocumented infections were the infection source of 79 of documented cases li et al 2020 leading to a great public health threatthe basic reproductive number r0 of the sars-cov-2 is estimated to range from 14 to 39 van doremalen et al 2020 wu et al 2020a the infectivity is greater than that of seasonal influenza 0921 and mers 029144 which is close to sars 3 coburn et al 2009 world health organization 2003 yin and wunderink 2018 however global spread of sars-cov-2 is far greater than mers and sars which might be associated with cases with mild symptom or asymptomatic cases according to wrapp et al the binding of sars-cov-2 to the obligate receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 is of higher affinity than that of sars-cov wrapp et al 2020 indicating that those with medical comorbidities may be at higher risks this may also indicate a higher time to infection even in the absence of masks pung et al 2020 for example there has been case reports of infection that took only 15 s standing in front of a stall in the vegetable market together with a confirmed case without wearing masks jiangbei news 2020 making matters worse cases in the incubation period might also have a certain degree of infectivity rothe et al 2020 for example a case visited germany from china participated in a business conference but the symptoms did not appear until that case travelled back to china three days later the patient was positive in covid-19 test two days later his associates displayed symptoms and were subsequently confirmeddue to strong infectivity and high proportion of asymptomatic cases the cluster covid-19 transmission becomes a difficult containment issue in some regions the number of cases related to the cluster transmission can reach 5080 of the total cases gopinath 2020 at present cluster cases of covid-19 have been reported in relatively confined or congregated places such as shopping malls offices buses cruises prisons hospitals and nursing homes ong et al found that the detection results of samples collected at the hospital air outlet were positive suggesting that the sars-cov-2 could pollute the environment through the droplet of patients ong et al 2020 wu et al investigated the cluster epidemic situation of a department store and found that the close distance between the salesman and the customer was easy to cause respiratory transmission when talking wu et al 2020b it is also reported that several senior officials in some countries were diagnosed as covid-19 cases which might be related to participation of public gatherings such as parliamentary meetings receptions and commemorative activities without wearing masks cases who come into contact with a large number of individuals through work or socially may become super-spreaders if they do not exercise preventive measuresin the past two decades countries in east asia have experienced infectious disease epidemics or air pollution episodes such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars avian influenza influenza and haze events hence wearing masks has become a pervasive in society as a way to prevent exposure this is for good reason as the population density in asian countries is generally higher than that in western countries and the crowding in a confined place will increase the infection risk or exposure therefore during the covid-19 pandemic the public is encouraged to wear masks in public places and people often comply as a form of health-seeking behavior greenhalgh et al 2020however in many western advanced economies those wearing masks are often met with suspicion in public even causing panic in certain situation universal mask use in the community has been discouraged by some health authorities with the argument that masks provide no effective protection against coronavirus infection feng et al 2020 although the 1918 pandemic h1n1 virus caused an estimated 4050 million deaths worldwide many still may view personal protective equipment ppe and physical barrier including wearing the mask as contrary to freedom and individualism world health organization 2005 furthermore there are some cultural underpinning of the use of masks as well as it was partially prohibited by the introduction of no mask act under the background of increasing political demonstration and terrorist attacks since the transmission route of sars-cov-2 has not been fully understood thus wearing masks should indeed be a cautionary prevention course of actionso far regulatory agencies and health care providers in all parts of the world have agreed on the mask use in hospital and laboratory settings the present controversy over wearing masks is mostly focused on the effectiveness of the mask and the necessity of wearing masks in the community setting the difference in conclusions of mask effectiveness studies is mainly due to different study contents study designs evaluation methods and endpoints understandably good evidence on this topic is difficult to assess many studies used self-reported questionnaire to quantify mask uptake status which may introduce subjective bias because the description depends on perception of participants barasheed et al 2016 in addition when the proportion of people who wear masks is too low in a group the impact of wearing masks on disease transmission would be limited elachola et al 2014as a basic non-pharmaceutical intervention npi measure wearing a mask is an effective means of preventing respiratory infectious diseases which could reduce the risk of infection world health organization writing group 2006 in this study mask is defined as a device covering the mouth and nose providing a barrier to minimize the direct transmission of infective agents according to relevant standards including disposable medical mask surgical mask and respirator with or without valve etc british standards institution 2019 standardization administration of china 2016 in a large systematic review of physical interventions to control spread of infectious diseases jefferson et al concluded from 67 studies that wearing masks is effective as one of the important barriers to transmission of respiratory viruses and evidences indicate n95 respirators were non-inferior to surgical masks jefferson et al 2011 other studies also found evidence that wearing masks can significantly reduce the risk of sars and influenza-related diseases jefferson et al 2009 macintyre et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 aldila et al constructed mers determinant mathematical model and found that compared with auxiliary nursing and government publicity wearing masks is the optimal choice for reducing the number of infections aldila et al 2018 in addition the costs of wearing masks is also the lowest for society as it is a simple low-cost intervention aldila et al 2018 during sars epidemic a survey conducted in the united states singapore chinese taiwan and hong kong showed that the meaning of wearing masks has exceeded their direct effects in disease prevention and has become a means of raising public awareness of other npis such as isolation pillemer et al 2015 barasheed et al systematically analyzed the utilization and effectiveness of masks by integrating 12710 samples from more than 50 countries in the world and found that wearing masks in crowded places could reduce the risk of respiratory infections by 20 barasheed et al 2016 a study in hong kong found that the odds ratio or value of wearing masks in public places was only 036 which was lower than that of living room disinfection or  041 and frequent hand washing or  058 indicating that wearing masks effectively restricted the community spread of sars-cov in hong kong lau et al 2004the necessity of wearing masks by the public during covid-19 pandemic is under-emphasized in some countries it was implied that the public could be well protected via hand hygiene in the absence of masks cdc 2020a while effectiveness of hand hygiene against virus infection and transmission such as influenza is difficult to be determined in the community setting because of limited studies and heterogeneous study designs moncion et al 2019 wong et al reviewed 10 randomized controlled trails and concluded that the hand hygiene along did not have statistically significant efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza wong et al 2014 considering the effect of masks aiello et al carried out a randomized intervention trial in university residence halls during the influenza season they observed a 3551 reduction in influenza-like illness ili in the mask and hand hygiene group compared with the no mask group during 20062007 aiello et al 2010 therefore they emphasized that mask and hand hygiene should be encouraged during seasonal influenza outbreaks especially during the beginning of a pandemic when vaccines may not be available the effectiveness of community use of masks was found to be related with the reduction of the clinical infection risk by preventing from pathogens inhalation and reducing hand-to-face contact macintyre et al 2009 moreover macintyre and chughtai found that masks and masks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings macintyre and chughtai 2015 taken together these evidences implied that wearing masks would be able to reduce the burden of infectious diseasesas tedros adhanom ghebreyesus the who director-general mentioned on march 18 2020 do not assume you will not be infected prepare as if you will die ghebreyesus 2020 the government of china has implemented a risk-based mask use strategy for general public people in public congregated places and confined congregated places confirmedsuspected cases and close contacts and occupational exposed workers under various scenarios which could be used as a reference table 1
 as an example during the covid-19 pandemic it is suggested to wear the mask in congregated places such as offices shopping malls restaurants conference room etc or relatively confined environments such as elevators transportation vehicles etc the mask is generally used by general public while the respirator or a filtering face piece which is designed to protect the wearer from exposure to airborne contaminants is mainly used by health care workers especially during agp european centre for disease prevention and control 2020 the exhalation valve is sometime used in the respirator in order to reduce the breathing resistance however the inhalation valve closes and the exhalation valve opens of the mask when the wearer breathing implying that the exhaled gas is not filtered and directly discharged into the surrounding environment as a result the respirator recommended for suspected cases confirmed cases asymptomatic carriers and close contacts must not contain the valve cdc 2020c moreover considering the probable insufficient mask production masks could be repeatedly used under the prerequisite of public health protection in areas with middle to low risksrational guidance should be provided concerning the use of masks the content of messages to the public should include 1 the necessity of wearing the mask 2 selection of the proper masks 3 rational use of the mask in different situations 4 disposable of the mask and 5 other prevention and control measures which should not be neglected there is not a single measure that could provide complete protection to the public therefore mask use must be combined with hand hygiene ventilation improvement reduction of gatherings and social and physical distancing to inform the public the government could 1 invite mainstream press such as tv stations broadcasts newspapers etc to participate in mask education 2 spread relevant knowledge via social media eg twitter facebook and instagram or display screens and billboards in public places 3 hand out mask instruction materials to the public and 4 carry out training and seminars in places such as hospitals schools kindergartensas the use of masks during the covid-19 pandemic would contribute to the rapid consumption of masks in limited time two essential countermeasures should be taken into consideration the government should timely stimulate mask production many countries have been facing a severe shortage of medical resources including medical masks in this circumstance the mask price increased sharply and the public stole or fought for masks in some regions in addition diplomatic disputes even arose to solve this problem the government could 1 procure surgical masks globally through different channels and means 2 distribute masks in accordance with risk level and 3 explore prospects of local production research on mask reuse should also be encouraged for example song et al has proposed an approach for medical mask use using hairdryer and they are still working on further improvement song et al 2020 after the treatment the medical mask could be used by the public but the reuse in a hospital settings is still unexploredthe face mask distribution priority should be given to healthcare workers providing care services eg front-line healthcare workers nursing staff in institutions and healthcare personnel in private clinics personnel who provide essential services and who are required to have contact with the public at work eg those providing public transport emergency services and immigration services and vulnerable groups in the society eg unaccompanied children elderly people without family support and disabled personsthe globe is more interconnected than ever if the countries with weaker health systems fail to control the pandemic other countries would be re-exposed by the covid-19 for the foreseeable future if the countries with weak health systems fail to control the pandemic other countries would be exposed in the danger of being harassed by the covid-19 for the long term as chief of un claimed we must create the conditions and mobilize the resources necessary to ensure that developing countries have equal opportunities to respond to this crisis in their communities and economies united nations secretary-general 2020 in mid-february france took early action to help china sending 17 tons of similar supplies under the well control of covid-19 china has sent supplies to italy the hardest hit among european countries and to spain us news 2020a case in point lvmh the worlds biggest luxury goods group has also ordered 40 million health masks from a chinese supplier to help france coping with this pandemic us news 2020b it could be seen that international cooperation with manufacturing and distribution logistics may optimize mask resource allocationin each country the most vulnerable group should be paid more attention when distributing masks they have lower health levels weaker affordability of medical costs and a higher proportion of infection the neglect of this group would increase the possibility of the long-term presence of covid-19 in society causing continuous economic losses therefore the government should establish a strategy in distribution method of masks to protect the benefits of the vulnerable group and eliminate the health inequities due to mask shortage for example enclosed institutional facilities such as nursing homes and orphanages are places with great potential for cluster outbreak of covid-19 furthermore the elderly and children are susceptible to respiratory infectious diseases lastly government may keep a certain number of masks in reverse to satisfy the urgent need for this population for now people around the world should not miss the opportunity to wear face masks to mitigate spread of sars-cov-2in the context of rapid spread of covid-19 globally there is a lack of consensus on the mask use as a npi amide the pandemic this study summarized that 1 main transmission routes of sars-cov-2 include droplet contact transmissions and possible airborne transmissions which is characterized by high proportion of cases with mild symptom or asymptomatic cases strong infectivity and a large number of clusters 2 the necessity of wearing masks by the public during covid-19 pandemic has been under-emphasized and 3 a risk

appropriately investigated and resolved jw and lp contributed equally to this workthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papercoronaviruses are a subfamily of viruses 5 all viruses contain nucleic acids either dna or rna and a protein coat which encases the nucleic acid some viruses are also enclosed by an envelope of fat and protein molecules 56the sars-cov-2 previously named 2019-novel coronavirus by the world health organization who is a beta-coronavirus 5 coronaviruses contain an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna genome of 30 kb 7 with high rates of mutation and recombination 8beta-coronaviruses are represented by two types of coronaviruses capable of causing severe respiratory tract infection namely sars-cov and mers-cov 5the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 is 962 similar to that of cov-ratg13 in bats in contemporary literature there are some articles that advance the hypothesis of a close correlation between sars-cov-2 and bats even if the etiopathogenesis has not yet been scientifically proven 59 current studies show the high transmission capacity of the virus with a basic reproduction number r0 varying between 14 and 65 10 or 26 and 47 11both measles and varicella have an r0 higher than that of covid-19 being considerably more contagious in the case of measles r0 varies between 12 and 18 while for varicella it is between 10 and 12 1213 sars-cov-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme a glycoprotein localized at the endothelium of the pulmonary capillaries as a cellular receptor for human infection 59 regarding the clinical symptomatology covid-19 acts directly on the upper and lower respiratory tract the characteristic symptoms of the infection are fever cough general malaise ageusia shortness of breath and asthenia gastrointestinal complications have been reported albeit rarely 14 however diffuse alveolar damage is the most commonly observed finding with respiratory virus infections both in the acute and late stages 15 these medical conditions require patient hospitalization and a potential overload for the national health service nhs 16 comorbidities in infected patients such as pre-existing aerial infections heart failure liver failure tumors or systemic alterations coincide with a drastic worsening of prognosis 1117 the transmission of covid-19 is variable and can occur in different circumstances first through coughs and sneezes second through contact with surfaces directly exposed to the virus and last by inhaling aerosols 11 initial studies have been performed to evaluate the half-life of the virus on different surfaces and for determining the severity of infection through surface contact in a comparative study between sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 it has been observed that the capacity of surface stability in each virus is similar sars-cov-2 is more resistant on stainless steel and plastic and less on cardboard and copper although on the first two mentioned surfaces it can persist for almost 72 h it progressively loses its viral load 18 the most accredited transmission methods between humans are respiratory droplets and the fecal-oral route 19 in previous coronavirus-related epidemics specifically mers-cov the risk of nosocomial infection was considerable therefore the need to determine guidelines for the correct disinfection of the working health environment is the first step in controlling infections 20towards the last week of december 2019 cases of abnormal pneumonia with unknown etiology were recorded in wuhan the capital of the hubei province in the geographical heart of the peoples republic of china 11 in the second half of january the chinese competent authorities confirmed 6000 cases of patients infected with sars-cov-2 although 80000 cases were estimated at that time 21 however unlike sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 has shown a greater tendency for rapid human-to-human transmission with an r0 varying between 14 and 65 and an incubation period ranging from 2 to 14 days with an average of 7 days 10 on 31 january 2020 213 deaths had been confirmed globally in 19 different countries 11 according to the data of 14 march 2020 italy was the most affected european country followed by spain 22 on 3 may 2020 the number of people currently positive in italy was 100179 with 28884 deaths 23 the average age of people who died of covid-19 was 785 years while the average age of diagnosis was 65 22 the age group with the highest mortality rate was 80 to 89 years with a male predominance 67 the mortality rate in the male population increased by 10 77 in the 7079 age group 22 forty-eight percent of patients deceased from sars-cov-2 exhibited three or more comorbidities two comorbidities 26 one comorbidity 23 and no comorbidity 12 hypertension diabetes and ischemic heart diseases are among the main preexisting pathologies only 1 of deaths from covid-19 occurred in patients under the age of 50 years lombardy was the most affected region accounting for 68 of the national cases followed by emilia romagna 164 and veneto 43 24 these data prompted authors to investigate the existence of a possible link between the exponential transmission of covid-19 in certain italian regions and the pollution of atmospheric particulate matter the latter acting as a vector of the virus 25 however this is a spurious association because there are systematic errors that determine the lack of correlation between these two factorsaccording to that reported by the new york times 26 dentistry is one of the most exposed professions to the covid-19 contagion it is necessary to establish a clinical protocol to be applied in the working environment to avoid new infections and progressive virus spread in daily clinical practice the patients oral fluids material contamination and dental unit surfaces can act as sources of contagion both for the dentist and the assistant and for the patient himself or herself saliva and blood droplets that are deposited on the surfaces or aerosol inhalation generated by rotating instruments and ultrasound handpieces constitute a risk for those who occupy or will occupy those environments therefore the use of disinfectants and personal protective equipment ppe remain essential for the proper development of the dental profession 27the sudden spread of sars-cov-2 has determined the need to modify both preventive and therapeutic protocols in dental practice consequently the need to analyze the available sources in the literature to update clinical practice is crucialthe aim of this narrative review is to investigate preventive measures in dental practice by assessing the operator and patient health protection during the new covid-19 emergency by considering past experiences in terms of prevention as the virus was only recently discoveredspecial attention is devoted to personal protection equipment such as respirators and surgical masks due to the major exposition of dental workers to the coronavirusthe authors carried out a narrative review and not a systematic review as the topic is based on a recent event and there are still several aspects pending to be analyzedthe process of selecting scientifically valid sources took place over five weeks between 1 april and 4 may 2020the search engines used were pubmed scielo and google scholar the boolean operators used and and orthe mesh terms for the research were dental care dentistry dental offices masks coronavirus dental equipment and disinfectants non-mesh words were sars-cov-2 and ppe the following terms were used with boolean operators to combine searches covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or coronavirus and dental care or dental office or dentistry with no limitation to the year of publication in addition a second search was made masks or disinfectants or ppe or dental equipment and covid-19 or coronavirus or sars-cov-2included in the study were bibliographic reviews systematic reviews meta-analyses randomized controlled trials cohort studies case reports and studies in english italian spanish and portuguese the exclusion criteria were as follows articles not related to the topic animal studies full-text not available and articles in other languages no time limits were applied during the screening phase of the scientific articles figure 1given the heterogeneous results the selected articles were divided into two main groups according to the treated topic sars-cov-2 guidelines in dentistry table 1 and analysis of preventive masks used for protection against sars-cov-2 table 2a third group on disinfectants was analyzed the results obtained demonstrate compliance and homogeneity between the authorsin studies done by rabenau et al 37 and kampf et al 38 ethanol proved to be one of the first-choice disinfectants in percentages ranging from 80 to 95 used as a hand rub gel 37 or 62 to 71 used as a surface disinfectant 38 the coronavirus is reduced to below recording levels in a variable lapse of time between 30 and 60 sin the study by rabenau et al similar results were observed with disinfectant based on 45 iso-propanol 30 n-propanol and 02 mecetronium ethyl sulfate furthermore the use of surface disinfectants such as mikrobac forte containing benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine khorsolin ff containing benzalkonium chloride glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride and dismozon containing magnesium monoperphthalate can be valid options even if the desired effect is obtained after 3060 min 37 with all tested preparations sars-cov-2 was inactivated to below the limit of detection regardless of the type of organic load 03 albumin 10 fetal calf serum and 03 albumin with 03 sheep erythrocyteskampf et al in carrier tests demonstrated the disinfectant action of ethanol at 6271 against the sars coronavirus in 60 s of sodium hypochlorite between 0105 in one min and glutaraldehyde at 2in contrast 004 benzalkonium chloride 006 sodium hypochlorite and 055 ortho-phtalaldehyde were less effective 38the percentages varied in the suspension tests where ethanol between 78 and 95 2-propanol 70100 the combination of 45 2-propanol with 30 1-propanol glutardialdehyde 0525 formaldehyde 071 and povidone iodine readily inactivate the coronavirus hypochlorite is effective at a concentration greater than 021 38fundamentally the authors agree table 1 that it is essential to perform an accurate telephone triage a subsequent triage in dental clinics and a complementary questionnaire to collect as much information as possible about the patient and his or her family members specifically regarding symptoms and movements in the previous 14 days 2728293031 temperature measurement is recommended when the patient enters the dental office if the body temperature exceeds 373 c it is suggested the treatment be postponed 30 in patients with a cured covid-19 infection the american dental association ada guidelines propose to reschedule dental treatment at least 72 h after the resolution of the symptoms or 7 days after the appearance of initial symptoms such as fever controlled without antipyretics and spontaneous improvement of breathing 39 meng et al in a precautionary way set the necessary recovery period to 30 days before performing non-deferrable dental care in patients who have been infected 28 for medical-legal issues a patients self-certification is also required with regard to what heshe claims during the telephone and clinical triage phasethe ada and the centers for disease prevention and control cdc recommend keeping the waiting room empty without magazines and avoiding the overlap of two or more appointments if this is not possible the minimum distance between one patient and the other must be 2 m 6 feet in each directionin extreme situations for health protection it is reasonable to ask patients to wait in their vehicle if possible or nearby to the dental clinic and advise them by telephone call or message when it is their turn 40as far as pediatric dentistry is concerned persons accompanying minor age patients are asked to come to the appointment in the smallest possible number wear a protective mask wait in the waiting room and not attend the patients treatment to avoid the risk of aerosol inhalation 27further accurate studies have been carried out to demonstrate the importance of oral rinses just before dental treatment costa et al in a study in 2019 highlighted how the use of chlorhexidine at 012 and 020 alters the amount of bacteria viruses and fungi present in the oral biofilm reducing the risk of cross-contamination due to aerosol 29 since covid-19 is sensitive to oxidation peng et al proposed rinsing with 1 hydrogen peroxide or alternatively with 02 povidone-iodine 30 this must be interpreted with caution saliva is constantly and cyclically renewed by the salivary glands making the virus available againregardless of the type of treatment planned healthcare professionals especially dentists hygienists and dental assistants must follow rigid protocols related to dressing and personal protective equipment hair caps protective goggles surgical masks or n95 disposable surgical gowns special footwears and protective visors are essential 2728293031 according to the en iso 374-52016 regulation for medical protection gloves to be considered functional against microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi must pass the penetration test which analyzes air and water transition through material pores seams holes and other structural imperfections 41 iso 16604 2004 method b is an additional test that is necessary to certify the specific protection of the gloves against viruses 42the ppe should be used as asserted in the instructions in the user manual and must be disposed of as special waste it is always recommended to check the integrity of the ppe and if any negative findings eliminate the ppe immediately 43there are several articles in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of surgical masks in comparison to respirators table 2 the distance and length of time in which particles remain suspended in the air are determined by particle size settling velocity relative humidity and air flow 36the european standard classifies filtering facepiece respirators ffp into three categories ffp1 ffp2 and ffp3 with minimum filtration efficiencies of 80 94 and 99 consequently ffp2 respirators are approximately equivalent to n95 and therefore recommended for use in the prevention of airborne infectious diseases in the us and other countries 4445both long et al 32 and radonovich et al 34 in their respective analyses did not find significant differences between the n95 and surgical masks in terms of protection from the influenza virus similar results were also observed in the study by offeddu et al which was performed two years before the current covid-19 health emergency on one hand there is an equal effectiveness between the two types of masks on the influenza virus however compared to nonspecific respiratory tract infections the n95 masks give slightly better results 33 macintyre et al instead obtained diametrically opposing results they showed through a randomized controlled clinical study on 3591 subjects that health workers who used n95 masks continuously during the shift or in situations considered to be at high risk presented an 85 chance of not contracting a viral infection transmitted via droplets 36in addition the n95 mask group compared to the control group was associated with a significantly lower risk of contracting influenza as confirmed by the laboratory the authors suggest updating the classification of infectious transmissions they consider that focusing only on aerosols and droplets is an oversimplificationin a recent study ma et al analyzed the degree of protection of surgical masks n95 and home masks four layers of paper and polyester against the virus n95 masks showed greater reliability 35lee et al focused on particles between 0093 and 161 m and demonstrated that the ffp respirators provided better protection than the surgical masks suggesting that such surgical masks are not a good substitute for ffp respirators in the case of airborne transmission of bacterial and viral pathogens 44 the principal limitation of surgical masks is due to the poor face fit and the consequential possibility of aerosol aspiration 43in spain the dentists council consejo de dentistas reports a maximum of 4 h of use and if kept in good condition ffp2 or n95 masks can be sterilized through various techniques hydrogen peroxide vapor dry heat at 70 c for 30 min or in humid heat at 121 c however not for more than 23 times 45 the who protocol recommendations suggest the use of ffp3 masks according to the european nomenclature or n100 according to the united states nomenclature 46hand hygiene is considered the first step in limiting the spread of the virus who guidelines impose scrupulous hand-washing before and after any contact with the patient 46 being previously considered an essential tool for correct operating practice the rubber dam has become even more so after the viral epidemic of 2020 various authors underline the utility of the rubber dam on containment and protection from oral fluids it reduces the particles present in the aerosol by 70 30 and also drastically reduces the risk of cross-infection 272830 if it is not possible to position it peng et al recommend the use of the carisolv and an excavator for conservative treatments 30high-speed rotating instruments such as the turbine and the contra-angle must be equipped with an anti-retraction system which prevents the release of debris and fluids that can accidentally be inhaled by healthcare professionals during clinical procedures 2930 meng et al suggests minimizing the use of these tools if this is not possible the last appointment of the day should be intended for those patients who need dental treatments requiring the use of high-speed rotating instruments 28 they also recommend not to use intraoral radiographs therefore they propose the use of orthopantomography or ct if strictly necessary the authors agreed on the need for four-handed work to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in the dental care unit to manipulate the water-air syringe with extreme caution and to use large-volume aspirators 272830 concerning potentially deferred dental emergencies luzzi et al recommend remote telephone or assistance support from the dentist in the case of pulp pain therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and antibiotics such as beta-lactams are recommended if the patient does not have allergies 27alharbi et al classified therapeutic dental procedures into five groups emergencies emergencies manageable through invasive or non-invasive procedures minimum aerosol non-emergencies and elective treatments depending on the dentist among the emergencies the authors highlight maxillofacial fractures that compromise the respiratory tract uncontrolled post-operative bleeding and bacterial oral soft tissues infections with intra- or extra-oral swelling that negatively affect the patients respiratory capacity 47orthodontists are suggested to stop activating the rapid palate expander parents are instructed to reposition the ni-ti arch if it should go off-axis and cause a contact ulcer on the oral mucosa any non-urgent treatment must be postponed if this is not possible the dentist must follow strict protocols to avoid contagions peng et al advise the elimination of waste using special yellow double-layer bags for special waste and mark them to facilitate their elimination 30various disinfectants available on the market can effectively inactivate the sars-cov-2 the italian dentists association recommends covering all surfaces where possible with polyethylene wrap 48 the results obtained demonstrate compliance and homogeneity between the authorsrabenau et al 37 and kampf et al 38 illustrated that various groups of disinfectants such as propanol sodium hypochlorite and ethanol in percentages ranging from 80 to 95 as a hand rub 37 or 62 to 71 as a surface disinfectant 38 can reduce sars-cov-2 load to below recording levels in a variable lapse of time pertinent papers on this topic are limitedthe who guidelines recommend the use of 5 sodium hypochlorite with a 1100 dilution to be applied on surfaces for an average action time of 10 min constant ventilation of the dental surgery room is also recommended 46 studies have shown that other biocidal agents such as 00502 benzalkonium chloride or 002 chlorhexidine digluconate probably have lower efficiency 49the spanish dentists council suggests the use of 1 sodium hypochlorite for the disinfection of the impressions the action time of the disinfectant varies depending on the material used 10 min for alginate and 1520 min for elastomers 45as reported by kyun-ki et al it is necessary to establish preventive policies in clinical and hospital settings to avoid the high risk of nosocomial infections as with mers 50sabino-silva et al starting with the assumption that covid-19 may be present in saliva through major salivary gland infection or through the crevicular fluid suggest more accurate studies in order to evaluate the possibility of early and non-invasive virus diagnosis using saliva samples 51 the possibility of the role of salivary gland cells in the initial progress of the infection and as a source of the virus should be considered and validated 8dentistry remains one of the most exposed professions to sars-cov-2 each individual clinical situation must be adequately controlled and pondered by the healthcare professional defaults in protocols cannot be tolerated however there are indications in the literature on how to deal with emergenciescurrently the swab represents the only system of diagnosis and it requires a laboratory procedure that cannot be implemented in the dental clinic however rapid immunoglobulin tests which are not considered for diagnosis can report whether a healthcare professional has had the disease and been immunized the development of new diagnostic tools will provide a reasonable hope for greater protection from the virus in the future two types of rapid tests are currently being developed for covid-19 the first one directly detects sars-cov-2 antigens by nasopharyngeal secretions while the second indirectly records the antibodies present in the serum as part of the autoimmune response against the virus 52ahmed et al conducted a cross-sectional study on 699 dental practitioners from 30 different countries using an online survey between the second and the third weeks of march 2020 87 of participants were afraid of becoming infected with covid-19 from either a patient or a co-worker a considerable number of dentists 66 wanted to close their dental cabinets until the number of covid-19 cases declined 53the fear that dentists have regarding becoming infected by covid-19 could be less if dentists and dental healthcare workers conscientiously follow the relevant recommendations 53 looking ahead it is necessary to increase research efforts in aerosol control during dental treatments including improving engineering control in dental office design the covid-19 pandemic has exposed important gaps in the collective response of global healthcare systems to a public health emergency 54 dentistry as an integral part of the health care system should be prepared to play an active role in the fight against future emerging life-threatening diseasespreventive measures against covid-19 in dental practice include telephone and clinical triage supported by a questionnaire on recent symptoms and movements body temperature measurement oral rinses with 1 hydrogen peroxide and the use of specific ppespragmatic and technical recommendations for correct clinical practice are the implementation of anti-retraction dental handpieces four-handed work the use of a rubber dam and large-volume cannulas for aspirationffp2 or n95 and ffp3 respirators if compared to surgical masks provide greater protection to health workers against viral respiratory infectionsethanol between 62 and 71 and sodium hypochlorite between 01 and 05 are considered to be the best among the surface disinfectantsthis narrative review has some limitations as there is a current emergency in the literature there is a limited and heterogenous number of primary sources directly related to the repercussion of sars-cov-2 on the dental discipline further studies are needed in the futuresevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov have mortality rates about 10 and 37 respectively

 since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 facemasks have been considered to be vitally important to reduce the risk of infection because vaccination or specific antiinfective treatments are unavailable

 n95 respirators are used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles and must fit tightly to the users face surgical masks are designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the users face56 although surgical masks cannot prevent inhalation of small airborne particles both of them can protect users from large droplets and sprays

there are conflicting recommendations for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and pandemic influenza the world health organization who recommends using masks in lowrisk situations and respirators in highrisk situations but the centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends using respirators in both low and highrisk situations9 however n95 respirators may play a limited role in lowresource settings where there are a finite number of n95 respirators or it may be unaffordable
9
 also previous metaanalyses concluded there was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of n95 respirators due to a small number of studies that is prone to lack of statistical power
10
 
11
 additionally these metaanalyses were limited by the small number of included randomized control trials rcts more rigorous rcts of comparing n95 respirators with surgical masks against influenza published in recent years were not included in previous metaanalyses

in light of the growing number of rcts of masks use for protecting against influenza this systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of influenzainclusion criteria were 1 study type rct including clusterrandomized trial and nonrandomized controlled study 2 participants humans with influenza including pandemic strains seasonal influenza a or b viruses and zoonotic viruses such as swine or avian influenza and other respiratory viral infections as a proxy for influenza 3 intervention and comparator n95 respirators versus surgical masks  primary outcome laboratoryconfirmed influenza 5 secondary outcomes laboratoryconfirmed respiratory viral infections laboratoryconfirmed bacterial colonization laboratoryconfirmed respiratory infection and influenzalike illness and 6 settings hospital or community rcts were selected due to the potential possibility of high evidence level exclusion criteria were 1 theoretical models 2 human nonhuman experimental laboratory studies and 3 conference abstractwe searched pubmed embase and the cochrane library databases from inception to january 27 2020 to identify published systematic reviews on evaluating the use of masks for preventing influenza search strategy in pubmed could be found in table 1 and the strategy was adequately adjusted to use in other databases then primary rcts included in the systematic reviews were identified additionally we conducted an additional search to identify rcts published in the past five years from january 27 2015 to january 27 2020 using the databases and search strategies described above we also searched for clinicaltrialsgov to obtain unpublished data there were no publication status and language restrictions on selecting the studiestwo reviewers independently screened the articles based on the titles abstracts and full texts then two reviewers independently exacted the following data from included studies first author publication year country disease details of study population and intervention study design sample size settings and results all disagreements were resolved by discussiontwo reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of the selected rcts using the cochrane risk of bias tool

23
 using n95 respirators is likely to result in discomfort for example headaches
23
 a previous study
3
 reported that there was an inverse relationship between the level of compliance with wearing an n95 respirator and the risk of clinical respiratory illness it is difficult to ensure high compliance due to this discomfort of n95 respirators in all studiesthe reason for the similar effects on preventing influenza for the use of n95 respirators versus surgical masks may be related to low compliance to n95 respirators wear
23
 which may lead to more frequent doffing compared with surgical masks
13
 although n95 respirators may confer superior protection in laboratory studies designing to achieve 100 intervention adherence
24
 the routine use of n95 respirators seems to be less acceptable due to more significant discomfort in realworld practice
11
 therefore the benefit of n95 respirators of fitting tightly to faces is offset or subjugated
13
 however it should be noted that the surgical masks are primarily designed to protect the environment from the wearer whereas the respirators are supposed to protect the wearer from the environment
25

there are several limitations to this study first some rcts had a high risk of bias due to lack of allocation concealment and blinding although it is impractical to blind participants who would know the type of masks they are wearing second the number of included studies focusing on the community was small consequently the results of the subgroup analysis might be unreliable third we identified rcts from published systematic reviews which may result in the omission of relative rcts finally there might be publication bias and we cannot assess it due to an insufficient number of included rctsin conclusion the current metaanalysis shows the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratoryconfirmed influenza it suggests that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and nonhigh risk medical staffs those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patientsnoneon 31 december 2019 the wuhan municipal health commission announced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 within 3 months of initial reporting of this novel coronavirus cases had surpassed 100 000 worldwide and less than 2 weeks later global cases had doubled1 this pandemic has put immense strain on medical systems leading to current or impending shortages of personal protective equipment ppe on 7 february 2020 the who estimated that demand for ppe had increased by 100-fold since the start of the outbreak with prices increasing up to 20-fold2 prices continued to surge throughout the month of march 2020 and the new york times reported that the federal stockpile for public health emergencies can only meet approximately 1 of the estimated need3 as a result of the high medical demand and system strain caused by sars-cov-2 efforts to produce and stockpile a sufficient supply of n95 respirators and face masks have fallen shortthe type and amount of ppe that should be used when treating a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 varies based on clinical job and setting4 for healthcare workers providing direct inpatient care for patients with covid-19 a medical mask gown gloves and eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be used4 if aerosol-generating procedures are being performed healthcare workers should also wear an apron and use an n95 respirator in the place of a surgical mask4 in outpatient settings providers examining patients with respiratory symptoms should wear a medical mask gown gloves and eye protection4 a different set of ppe requirements for healthcare workers not involved in direct care of patients with covid-19 and for the general public have been outlined by the who and vary based on circumstance if medical-grade ppe is not available or in short supply the who recommends appropriate and minimised use of ppe according to clinical setting and personnel4
the purpose of this scoping review is to compile existing evidence on the use and efficacy of medical-grade and alternative forms of facial protection for healthcare workers amidst the growing global shortage for the purposes of this review facial protection refers to surgical masks n95 respirators and face shields table 1 in studies that did not specify the category of protection the term ppe is usedwe sought to define and characterise the state of global medical-grade mask shortages that have resulted from the covid-19 pandemic in order to be included in the review records needed to focus on transmission or prevention of sars and other respiratory illnesses strategies for extended use reuse and decontamination of medical-grade masks or the efficacy and safety of alternative and improvised masks with regard to materials design and decontamination strategies our review was intended to evaluate the evidence pertaining to medical-grade facial protection currently in use as a result we limited our search to records published or most recently updated between 1 january 2000 and 24 march 2020 to ensure that the results would be applicable to current ppe standards records were included if they were written in english and described an aspect of covid-19 transmission prevention or the usage of ppe preclinical and quantitative studies were included in addition to grey literature in order to consider different aspects of disease transmission and protective equipmentthe scope methodology and timeline of this review were restricted as a result of the pandemic and time-sensitive nature of the information peer-reviewed documents were identified using a single database medline via pubmed the full electronic search strategy for pubmed and google is included in online supplementary file 1 due to the novel nature of the covid-19 pandemic the review included grey literature such as preprint publications product descriptions guidelines guidance documents and news articles in addition to peer-reviewed publications we initially used grey literature to define best or recommended practices then analysed peer-reviewed documents this diverse array of sources was included with the intention of capturing a more complete picture of the rapidly developing nature of the covid-19 pandemic need for medical-grade ppe and global responses a search of google with no date restrictions was conducted between 15 march 2020 and 24 march 2020 and the first 20 hits were screened we also considered additional resources we knew existed or were recommended by colleagues including an independent reviewer n2the identified grey literature was reviewed by at least one author and records were selected if eligibility criteria were met at least one author reviewed titles initially generated from the pubmed searches selecting those that were available in english and relevant to one of the components addressed above the relevant titles were exported and duplicates were excluded next the selected records including both grey literature and peer-reviewed articles were reviewed by at least two authors according to the following criteria 1 the record defined or characterised the state of current ppe shortages defined or characterised the mode of transmission or prevention of covid-19 examined evidence for the extended use reuse and decontamination methods for medical grade masks or addressed the efficacy and safety of alternative and improvised masks and 2 the record was available in english this initial search was further refined to exclude articles that were not applicable to healthcare settings concerned product design at the industrial level or focused on ppe other than n95 respirators surgical masks or face shields figure 1 published systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded as meta-analysis was beyond the scope of this scoping review we resolved disagreements on record selection and data extraction by discussion with other authors as needed based on the rapid nature of this review in the setting of a global pandemic our scoping review required process tailoring we did not prepare or register a protocol for screening titles and abstracts and our primary literature search was limited to one database formal critical appraisal of the quality of individual sources was not performed as this was beyond the aim of this scoping revieweach article was tagged by its focus and data charting was performed by at least one author extracted data were shared with all authors and used to synthesise the available evidencewe grouped the records by topic and setting and when possible summarised the study designs measures used and broad findings the included records are described in online supplementary file 2 with a description of studies place of origin setting population or product studied intervention and outcome measures when a systematic review or meta-analysis was identified we counted the number of studies included in the review that potentially met our inclusion criteria and noted how many studies had been missed by our search n0this research was done without patient involvement patients were not invited to comment on the study design and were not consulted to develop patient-relevant outcomes or interpret the results patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracywe retrieved a total of 5462 articles using the search strategy of which 269 were accessed in full text and 48 met the inclusion criteria figure 1 of these 35 were basic research 9 were clinical research and 4 were secondary research additionally a total of 41 grey literature sources were identified through targeted website searching and 19 met the inclusion criteria table 2 in total 48 of the articles were peer reviewed the full list of included studies is presented in online supplementary file 2in experimental settings n95 respirators demonstrate efficient filtration of nanoparticles and bioaerosols69 when compared with surgical masks in this setting n95 respirators provide superior protection against aerosols and viruses similar in size to influenza especially when combined with eye protection6 8 1012 in one study layering of up to five surgical masks improved in vivo filtration efficiency though fit factor scores using this strategy remain markedly inferior to the minimum required for n95 respirators 137 vs 10013 nevertheless isolated surgical mask material protects against 95 of viral aerosols under laboratory conditions while surgical masks are able to reduce aerosolised influenza exposure by an average of sixfold depending on mask design14 15
mask fit is another important component in the functional efficacy of n95 respirators untrained individuals without proper fit testing can often achieve federal drug administration fda minimum fit factor standards but fewer than 25 achieve the score of 100 expected in workplace settings16 addition of a peripheral vaseline barrier has been shown to prevent peripheral air leakage and reduce exposure to airborne viral particles making this a potential compensatory strategy when fit testing is not feasible17 further evidence regarding mask fit in the inpatient setting is presented in the next sectionthe use of face shields as an adjunct to medical-grade masks has been employed during the covid-19 pandemic face shields provide barrier protection from splash and splatter contamination as well as acutely expelled aerosols generated during procedures such as bronchoscopy airway suctioning and intubation18 however the evidence for the effectiveness of face shields in preventing transmission of viral respiratory diseases is minimal as highlighted in a recent narrative review19 our scoping review identified only one study that evaluated face shields for respiratory protection using cough simulation researchers demonstrated that face shields were shown to reduce the risk of inhalation exposure up to 95 immediately following aerosol production however protection was decreased with smaller aerosol particles and 30 min after cough simulation due to persistence of airborne particles and particle flow around the sides of the mask20 because they lack a peripheral seal face shields should not be used as primary protection for preventing respiratory disease transmission but can be used as an adjunct to other facial protectionseveral studies have been conducted examining the efficacy of medical-grade masks in the inpatient setting a small randomised controlled trial rct found that incidence of upper respiratory infection symptoms was similar between groups of inpatient healthcare workers who wore surgical masks and those who did not wear masks21 however studies comparing efficacy of different types of medical-grade masks in the inpatient setting have conflicting results one non-inferiority rct of nurses working in medical and paediatric inpatient units found that use of a surgical mask compared with a fit-tested n95 respirator resulted in non-inferior rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza22 several other rcts found that rates of respiratory infection illness were lower in healthcare workers who used fit-tested n95 respirators compared with those who used surgical masks2325 similarly n95 respirators have been shown to provide superior protection against respiratory bacterial infections or bacterial-viral coinfections when compared with surgical masks26 the literature regarding mask fit in the inpatient setting is limited to one study an rct comparing fit-tested and non-fit-tested n95 respirators found no significant difference in ability to protect against respiratory illness despite in vitro evidence of significant reduction in filtration efficacy with peripheral air leakage24 27 furthermore non-fit-tested n95 respirators were significantly more protective than surgical masks24 in the context of covid-19 a recent case report identified 41 healthcare workers exposed to sars-cov-2 through aerosol-generating procedures among these providers 85 were wearing surgical masks at the time of exposure and the remaining 15 were wearing n95 respirators28 none of the exposed providers contracted covid-1928 our scoping review did not identify any other studies comparing the efficacy of medical-grade masks during aerosol-generating proceduresalthough extended use and reuse of n95 respirators have been suggested as conservation strategies to meet pandemic-level demands the safety and effectiveness of these practices remain unclear29 these devices maintain function for 8 hours of continuous or intermittent use30 manufacturers recommend disposal of n95 respirators after close contact with a patient with an infectious disease after use during an aerosol-generating procedure or on contamination with bodily fluids30 however extended use in combination with appropriate hand hygiene and contamination-limiting practice is considered minimal risk in the context of typical patient interactions31 in one study continuous use of n95 respirators by healthcare workers in the inpatient hospital setting was more effective for prevention of respiratory illness than targeted use only during high-risk procedures23 addition of a cleanable face shield or surgical mask over an n95 respirator has been proposed as a method of extending respirator use though this approach lacks epidemiological evidence and can exacerbate user discomfort due to increased respiratory resistance32 although the maximum number of potential reuse cycles before respirator compromise has not been defined one laboratory study demonstrated a decrease in fit factor below the acceptable limit after five consecutive donnings33
the evidence comparing the efficacy of n95 respirators to surgical masks in the outpatient setting is minimal one rct conducted in the outpatient setting found no difference in rates of respiratory illness between healthcare workers who used n95 respirators compared with those who used surgical masks34
ideal n95 respirator decontamination methods should preserve integrity and filtration properties appropriately disinfect and not harm the user35 studies using sars-cov-1 models have observed the persistence of infectious particles for up to 24 hours on n95 respirators and suggest that reuse without interim decontamination could result in a compounded viral load36 37 a number of trials have evaluated n95 respirator function and stability after various decontamination procedures although they may be effective for viral inactivation methods using microwave irradiation microwave-generated steam and moist heat incubation can compromise the physical integrity of respirator components3841 treatment with bleach results in residual odour release of chlorine gas on exposure to moisture and in one model partial nose pad dissolution without an associated increase in aerosol penetration38 39 decontamination with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma autoclave 160c dry heat 70 isopropyl alcohol and soaking in soap and water may cause significant loss of filtration efficiency39 42
although ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi has previously been shown to inactivate sars-cov-1 and preserve n95 performance after three cycles of exposure totalling 45 min at 18 mwcm2 one study found that increasing uvgi doses could compromise the strength of n95 respirator material and straps39 4345 a recent analysis of n95 decontamination methods using escherichia coli as a surrogate model for sars-cov-2 found that application of chlorine and alcohol-based methods led to a significant decrease in the efficiency of n95 filtration media due to loss of microfibre static charge while use of ultraviolet light boiling water vapour and dry oven heating maintained filtration efficiency and successfully decontaminated n95 respirators46
overall strategies involving the use of uvgi ethylene oxide dry oven heating and hydrogen peroxide vapour may be most promising for preservation of mask function and integrity3840 42 decontamination with uvgi moist heat incubation and microwave-generated steam does not appear to significantly affect n95 respirator fit or comfort47 until application of these methods has been adequately investigated in the hospital setting their safety and effectiveness in the particular context of the sars-cov-2 outbreak is unknown although decontamination and reuse of n95 respirators could help conserve facial protection during emergency shortages or in low-resource settings additional research is required to understand the impact of these methods on mask fit and function as well as their effectiveness against sars-cov-2as previously discussed adding layers to a cloth mask could theoretically increase its effectiveness however there are little to no data available regarding effectiveness of a two-layer cloth mask with a middle filter and only one study that may guide the choice of said filter even with this scarcity of evidence some may choose to add a filter to improve the effectiveness of an improvised cloth mask when considering incorporation of a filter material it is important to consider durability breathability and the need for replacement51 recently some have proposed using heating ventilation and air-conditioner filter inserts with particle size filtration properties similar to those of n95 respirators64 electrostatic cotton and non-woven meltblown fabric are both known components of medical-grade masks and may also serve as useful filters however availability access and costs of these materials are likely to be prohibitive65 of note a news report from south korea mentions an innovative washable electrostatic cotton which can serve as a more durable insertable filter66 further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of these materials for preventing respiratory infection and penetration of viral particles this information may be particularly useful in low-resource settings if effective materials are inexpensive and readily accessiblewhile guidance for handling contaminated laundry in households with suspected or confirmed covid-19 cases exists our scoping review did not identify any literature regarding reuse and decontamination of improvised masks if improvised masks with filters are made our scoping review again found no evidence regarding their appropriate use and decontamination however it may be reasonable to treat the insertable filter as a single-use material and frequent change should be consideredevidence supports the superiority of medical-grade masks for protection against respiratory viruses in cases when medical-grade masks are not available the summarised research indicates that protection offered by certain improvised or reused masks is better than no protection at all50 improvised masks may be helpful in emergency situations supply shortages low-resource settings or for citizens in low-risk environments in order to preserve medical-grade facial protection for healthcare workers however there is a lack of evidence regarding optimal improvised mask design and material and whether combination with a face shield enhances protectionscientific research on sars-cov-2 is rapidly progressing and more information about proper ppe improvised facial protection and effective decontamination methods may be forthcoming there are many opportunities for future research in this field additional evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of alternative facial protection is required in order to better equip individuals to make improvised facial protection when necessary specifically further research on the effectiveness of an improvised cloth mask with an added filter versus cloth alone is warranted in addition comparisons of different possible filter media are warranted and should include discussion about accessibility of materials and the creation of guidelines for reuse finally development of effective and safe decontamination methods that do not compromise the integrity or filtration properties of facial protection is neededthis review has several limitations the literature included in this review is limited in scope design sample size and population diversity articles written in languages other than english were excluded which particularly limited the evaluation of recent articles related to the covid-19 pandemic studies on sars-cov-2 have been performed in settings experiencing the early phases of the pandemic which does not lend easily to standardised rcts or uniform study planning and execution additionally studies performed prior to the covid-19 outbreak were not specific to sars-cov-2 and it is unknown whether those results are applicable in the current context our review also included a number of small rcts and observational studies which have less statistical power as well as non-peer-reviewed articlesthe covid-19 pandemic has led to a massive medical ppe shortage alternative forms of facial protection are less effective but may serve as an intermediary in emergent situations based on the literature the safest approach to address this shortage is to ensure provision of a sufficient quantity of medical-grade facial protection for healthcare workers considering the limited evidence reused and improvised masks should be used as a last resort but may be beneficial when medical-grade facial protection is unavailable face shields should not be used as primary protection but rather as an adjunct to improvised masks public health and medical institutions should be prepared to ensure the safety of healthcare workers in all stages of crises therefore it is necessary to continue research and the publication of evidence-based emergency protocols that include recommendations for improvised protectionmany countries are battling with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic because of the absence of effective antiviral medications and vaccines to control the spread of covid-19 social distancing wearing of face masks and washing of hands which are transmission-reducing behaviors are being recommended as some of the most important measures123 because early transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is caused by pre-symptomatic- or pauci-symptomatic-infected individuals these non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors are getting more attention for the containment of the covid-19 pandemic456 these attempts at behavioral change are aimed at slowing down the spread of emerging infectious diseases and to flatten the epidemic curve thus the healthcare system resource capacity can be conserved while allowing time for the development of drugs and vaccines social distancing or spatial distancing including avoidance of outdoor activities public transportation healthcare facilities and crowded places with potential for physical contact between individuals reduced the number of infections23 wearing of face masks and washing of hands are also associated with reduced propensity of transmission5678periodically korea has experienced outbreaks including the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars influenza h1n1 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and covid-19 outbreaks in 2003 2009 2015 and 2020 respectively91011 differences occurred in epidemiologic outcomes number of cases fatality rates of these novel infectious disease outbreaks in korea only 3 confirmed cases and no death during sars more than 100000 confirmed cases and 260 deaths during influenza h1n1 and 185 confirmed cases and 36 deaths during mers-cov occurred9 since diagnosing the first covid-19 case in korea on 20 january 2020 10738 cases have been confirmed 243 deaths occurred and 3246 patients were isolated until 27 april 202012 in february 2020 korea became the worst affected country aside from china for a while and had several surges in the number of cases13 however the korea epidemic curve flattened without coercive restrictions following rapid interventions beginning in march 202014 one possible explanation for the mitigation of the surge was the strong efforts implemented by the korean government and the citizens of korea to practice social distancing and transmission-reducing behaviorsresurgence in the emerging infectious disease provides opportunity for comparing individuals levels of practicing non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors however no study has compared the proportion of practicing non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors between covid-19 and 2015 mers-cov outbreaks23715161718 the current study aimed to quantify and compare the individuals adherence to social distancing and transmission-reducing behavioral practices during the covid-19 and mers-cov outbreaks in korea factors influencing these practices were also determined we hypothesized that there would be differences in the rate of adherence to the non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors and the factors affecting these behaviors between the 2020 covid-19 and 2015 mers-cov outbreaksthis study which was conducted between 2015 and 2020 used the results of 4 surveys with a total of 4011 participants a sample size of each survey participants was estimated to ensure the 95 confidence interval ci 0025 desired margin of error 02 behavioral response proportion of population the 4011 participants included 2009 participants older than 19 years who were monitored during the mers-cov outbreak between june 2 and 25 2015 and 2002 participants older than 18 years who were investigated during covid-19 outbreak between february 4 and april 2 2020 all surveys were conducted using mobile 85 or landline 15 random digit dialing numbers in 8 regions nationally representative participants were selected post-stratication by sex age and province and chosen independently by each survey the total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total number of unweighted cases at the national level the weights were normalized to calculate the proportions and ratios but not for estimating the subtotal populations trained interviewers conducted all interviews using computer assisted telephone interviewing surveys 3 and 4 began approximately 2 weeks after the index case occurred while surveys 1 and 2 were conducted approximately a month after surveys 3 and 4 survey 1 was conducted just 10 days before the last confirmed patient of mers-cov on july 4 2015 however survey 2 was conducted when there were more than 100 confirmed cases the surveys were conducted by gallup korea an aliation of gallup international details including period number of respondents successfully interviewed and response rate for each of the four surveys are provided in table 1sex age occupation self-reported household economic status residential area presidential job approval rating party identification and affective risk perception as participants characteristics were investigated to identify factors

farmingforestryfishery blue-collar worker white-collar worker and full-time homemaker or student self-reported household economic status was classied into ve levels lower lower middle middle upper middle and upper participants were classied as either metropolitan or non-metropolitan residents presidential job approval rating was assessed using the following options approval disapproval or no opinion support for party identification was assessed based on alignment either with the ruling party opposition party or no opinion affective risk perception was assessed using the options worried or not worried19the interviews were conducted on the two aspects of the non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors which are social distancing measures and transmission-reducing practices supplementary data 1 and 2 social distancing was assessed using the following four questions 1 did you reduce or avoid outdoor activities or attend meetings this week because of mers-cov or covid-19 2 did you reduce or avoid using public transportation such as the bus or the subway this week because of mers-cov or covid-19 3 did you reduce or avoid using healthcare facilities such as the hospitals or public health centers this week because of mers-cov or covid-19 and 4 did you reduce or avoid visiting crowded markets departmental stores or large discount stores this week because of mers-cov or covid-19 transmission-reducing practice was assessed using the following two questions 1 do you wash your hands more often than usual because of mers-cov or covid-19 and 2 have you ever worn a face mask because of mers-cov or covid-19 all the questions about the non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors required yesno responses the development of the questionnaires on preventive behaviors had not gone through a validity procedure due to the urgency of the outbreak we also imposed the survey items on existing questionnaire developed by gallup korea an aliation of gallup internationalresponse rates according to preventive behaviors were calculated according to participants characteristics univariable analyses using 2 test were performed in the four surveys entirely and respectively to identify the relationships between practicing preventive behaviors and each demographic variable missing values of any outcome variable were  36 multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore factors influencing preventive behaviors in the four surveys entirely and respectively we performed multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for sex age occupation self-reported household economic status residential area presidential job approval and party identification15 affective risk perception was excluded from survey 1 and survey 2 logistic regression models to attain comparability because no data existed for it in survey 2 on the avoidance of outdoors activities extremely large number of events made the odds ratios ors in survey 2 logistic regression model unstable therefore surveys 1 and 2 logistic models were not reported using logistic regression analysis for transmission-reducing measures and social distancing measures y  1 was used when yes for

results showed that presidential job approval rating and washing of hands were significant in survey 3 but not in survey 4possibly the current study is the first to explore changes in individuals non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors during two different consecutive emerging infectious disease outbreaks in korea237151617202122first our study showed a marked increase in non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors such as social distancing wearing of face masks and washing of hands evenly across all subgroups during covid-19 compared to 2015 mers-cov during the previous 2003 sars outbreak in hong kong the level of preventive behavioral practice increased over time but differences in level was not compared between outbreaks23 a possible explanation for the increase of preventive behavioral practices during covid-19 in korea could be due to previous experience of emerging infectious disease epidemic intensifying the practice24 additional study is needed to examine why the preventive behavioral practice increased during covid-19 outbreak and to understand how differences in preventive behavioral practices affected the transmission during repeated and different emerging infectious disease outbreakssecond affective risk perception consistently influenced transmission-reducing behavioral practice during the 2020 covid-19 and 2015 mers-cov this is similar to previous studies results showing that risk perception is associated with non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors1516202225 however there is need to investigate for further understanding the association between risk perception affective and cognitive and preventive behaviors19third our results showing that low level of trust in the president and identification of opposition party influenced preventive behavioral practice during 2015 mers-cov but not during 2020 covid-19 are inconsistent with those of previous studies1517 differences in the korean governments responses to the two different emerging infectious disease epidemics could have affected how the public perceived the image of the president and the ruling party as well as the trust in the government9141926272829303132 further research is needed to understand the conditions of trust in the president and identification of a party that could affect preventive behavioral practiceshowever this study has some limitations first that this study used surveys on self-reported practices could mean that the data could be different from those obtained through observed practices therefore there could have been measurement errors ie social desirability bias yes-saying bias however surveys of observed practices are difficult to conduct during health crisis second this study used a cross-sectional design hence it could not establish causal relations third risk perception affective and cognitive reactions was not fully surveyed during the outbreaks limiting the interpretation of findings fourth the current study could not evaluate the intensity of the preventive behaviors finally because of the unexpected rapidly evolving outbreak this study could not examine the validity of the questionnaire using a test-retest designin conclusion the present study suggests for the first time the level of the practice rate of non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors and influencing factors during 2020 covid-19 and 2015 mers-cov in korea affective risk perception can increase practicing reducing transmission measures and it can be used to prevent the failure of preventive behavior management to understand the mechanism of behavioral immunity further exertions are needed behind the citizens the governmental public health sector as well as the academic society strategic interventions to suppress the spread of infectious diseases based on preventive behaviors works through cooperation of individuals with regulations and will be a salient contribution to a quick end to covid-19 pandemic thus policies to guide such strategic interventions need to be developedwuhan the capital of hubei province in china reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on december 31 2019 which was then named the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who14 cases spread to other chinese cities as well as other countries and regions the number of cases in wuhan and other cities in china increased rapidly57 on february 29 authorities reported more than 66000 confirmed cases and 2727 deaths in hubei with most occurring in wuhan the outbreak was controlled through the implementation of control policies after january 23 however the situation has deteriorated outside of china cases have surfaced in more than 100 countries8 with outbreaks in many nations9some articles have reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 in wuhan1013 but the epidemic characteristics in other cities have rarely been reported clinical manifestations do not vary widely but the epidemiology may differ from region to region wuhan once seemed completely out of control thousands of people were waiting to see doctors and many people died while waiting for hospital beds more than 30000 medical workers nationwide were sent to wuhan relieve the shortage of medical resources the situation in jingmen was quite different and strict control measures were put in place when the outbreak began a successful example of controlling covid-19we analyzed the epidemiology of 219 confirmed covid-19 patients admitted to the first peoples hospital of jingmen jm1ph which admitted all the confirmed patients within the municipal districts of jingmen a city in hubei located about 250 miles from wuhanfor this retrospective study we recruited patients in the jm1ph from january 12 to february 29 2020 all the covid-19 patients diagnosed in the municipal districts of jingmen were enrolled in this study the government closed all city entrances on january 26 but before that some patients arrived from other locations the study was approved by the jm1ph ethics committee oral consent was obtained from patientsepidemiological data were collected from patients medical records if more information was needed we communicated with attending health care providers patients and their families throat-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were obtained for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr the wuhan institute of virology provided the rt-pcr detection reagentswe described epidemiological data and observed the impact of control measures on the epidemicstatistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with spss 190 continuous variables were described using mean median interquartile range iqr values and categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentagesthe 219 patients were aged 2 to 88 years old with 502 of the sample being men the median age of the patients was 48 years iqr 3560 fig 1 including 33 patients in the intensive care unit icu the median age of the patients in icu was 66 years iqr 5776 ranging from 33 to 82 years old with 22 667 being men and 19 575 patients having chronic diseases including hypertension diabetes heart failure stroke and renal insufficiency by the end of january 29 11 patients had died 6 patients had uremia with long-term dialysis and 6 of them were men the average age of the patients who died was 583 with a range from 35 to 78 years oldthe covid-19 patients were divided into 3 groupswuhan group 88 cases patients with a history of exposure to wuhan sixty-one worked or lived in wuhan 22 had short-term exposure by staying in wuhan for about 2 days and 5 patients only visited a wuhan railway station or airport for about 2 hours these people were free to move around until january 23 and many subsequent cases of infection were caused by the wuhan groupfamily group 62 cases patients who had not been to wuhan within 20 days before the illness started and were infected by acquaintances mainly family members and other relatives friends and colleagues some of them only had brief contact with infected people such as talking or eating togetherstranger group 69 cases patients who had not been to wuhan within the 20 days before the illness started and had been infected by strangers most of them in a public place the first patient was a bus driver infected by his passengers he began to cough and have a fever on january 4 one female patient who had never been to wuhan was a sales clerk in a shopping center twenty-three patients were infected in hospital 12 had uremia and were on dialysis in 2 hospitals one citizen was infected only because she went to the supermarket a few times and since she could not buy a new mask had been continually wearing the same mask for several days without disinfecting it eight medical staff in the non-infected ward were infected by confirmed patients these staff worked in the gastroenterology department intensive care unit emergency department joint surgery department and dialysis room seven of them became ill between january 21 and 25 and one became ill on january 29the number of confirmed patients was analyzed according to the date of symptom onset for asymptomatic patients the date of admission was used instead fig 2 the number peaked on january 21 which was followed by a gradual decline most patients had a history of exposure to wuhan before january 25 and the number of locally infected cases peaked on january 26 the last patient from wuhan began to have symptoms of coughing and fever on february 8 after having left wuhan on january 22 the incubation period was more than 17 days most of the patients after february 8 2020 were family members of confirmed patients all patients admitted after february 9 2020 were family members of confirmed patientssars-cov-2 is a newly discovered and named single-strand positive-sense rna coronavirus that can cause respiratory disease14 it is related to the other two highly pathogenic viruses the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov that have emerged as major global health threats since 2002 sars-cov caused 8422 infections and 800 deaths and spread to 37 countries1516 and mers-cov infected 2494 individuals and caused 858 deaths worldwide1718 the number of confirmed covid-19 patients rose to 70000 in china by february 20 2020 with over 44000 of these in wuhan these numbers indicate that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov19 and without protection people can be infected easily when eating together shopping meeting talking and staying in crowded placesmost confirmed patients were between the ages of 27 and 68 and there was no difference between genders these findings are similar to the total cases in china20 which suggests that all humans are sensitive to covid-19 however older males and those with comorbid conditions are more likely to have more severe symptoms and potentially die this is consistent with a previous descriptive study of patients in jingyintan hospital which was responsible for the treatment of serious cases in wuhan10no antiviral treatment for covid-19 has been proven to be effective so far21 the best way to fight the virus is to block its spread in order to cope with the outbreak of covid-19 the government of jingmen has implemented several preventative measures since january 23 fig 3 local residents were advised to stay at home in order to contain the virus spread and were ordered to wear masks in public areas all markets except supermarkets were closed and all public transportation was suspended subsequently most roads into the city of jingmen were blockedthe benefits from these measures are seen in that the number of locally infected cases peaked on january 26 followed by a gradual decline most patients were infected in wuhan before january 25 and so they could not be controlled local infections from strangers were the most dangerous and the hardest to control since no one knew they were infected before onset of symptoms there were no new cases infected from strangers after 15 days of the implemention of the control measures indicating that most of them were infected before the control measures were implemented the last few cases were family members of confirmed patients which are hard to prevent when one is living in a home with an infected individualmore than 20 patients were in the non-infectious ward before their diagnosis these patients were spread across seven departments and only 8 medical staff members were infected moreover most of them were infected before january 20 when many doctors did not wear masks thirteen patients were in the respiratory department before diagnosis none of the respiratory medical staff had been infected and they had been wearing surgical masks all the time suggesting that masks can prevent most transmission of covid-19supermarkets started to limit the number of customers on february 9 and closed on february 17 however the epidemic had been under control before february 9 fig 2 while there were few people infected as everyone wore masks even though many of them wore only one mask repeatedly without disinfection this indicated that as long as masks were worn social gatherings would not cause an outbreak of covid-19since the time of infection of most patients could not be determined we did not analyze the incubation period it was reported that the incubation period was 4 to 7 days22 based on the sars experience the maximum incubation period is currently considered to be no more than 14 days but one case in our study was significantly longer at 17 days a recent study reported the longest incubation period to be 24 days11 the maximum incubation period is unclearthe asymptomatic case is a challenge to disease control and 12 of cases are asymptomatic in china20 four asymptomatic cases were diagnosed during screening because they were close contacts if they were infected by strangers they will not be found until some people around them being infected and diagnosedthere were 3 limitations in this study first only 219 patients diagnosed with covid-19 were included second the unconfirmed suspected cases in the early stages were excluded in the analyses some patients were discharged as suspected patients after one negative nucleic acid test many patients had a second or third check before being diagnosed third most of the data were from patients medical records with the potential of a few of them not being accurate enoughin conclusion all people are susceptible to covid-19 and older males and those with comorbid conditions are more likely to become severe cases even though covid-19 is highly contagious control measures have proven to be very effective particularly wearing masks which could prevent most infectionsthe study was designed by qg and zd fx jw jw and qg collected the epidemiological and clinical data and processed statistical data qijun gao drafted the manuscript yh contributed to critical revision of the reportthe pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an unprecedented situation that we have never experienced during the last century1 to cope with this situation in the absence of curative treatment or vaccine we must turn to universal infection control resources hand hygiene environmental control personal protective equipment ppe and quarantine2 all of these resources are limited and should be used rationally2 the global supply chains of ppe have collapsed so that ppe is not available for the person place and time requiring it the most while it is overused than needed elsewhere public use of ppe should be prudential when long-term reign of covid-19 pandemic with multiple waves is expectedhere i purposed to break the myth of a high efficiency particulate air hepa mask for everyone-mask-wearing policy based on previous reports and one simple experiment how to prevent the spread of common cold and flu are well understood from plentiful resources3 first the respiratory viruses are transmitted more commonly via contact than droplet secondly the control measure to reduce spread of respiratory viruses should therefore focus on contact precaution the single most important protective measure is hand washing rather than mask wearing lastly the person who wear a face mask to prevent the droplet transmission is the one who have respiratory symptomsbecause covid-19 is an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 the seventh coronavirus to infect human4 all above mentioned measures are applicable for covid-19 too unlike other respiratory virus infections covid-19 has shown many cases with mild or no presenting symptoms who are highly infectious during asymptomatic period5consequently new policy has been implemented in the covid-19 pandemic era that everyone in public area wears masks not to transfer their germ to others long-term implementation of such policy might be difficult without the threat of a looming pandemic although proper assessment on the feasibility of this policy has not been made it appears to settle in as the new normal these days therefore it is important what type of mask is appropriate for the policythe most important factor in choosing mask type will be how well it can contain user-generated droplets indeed hepa mask filters can collect particles more efficiently than surgical mask filters only when the mask fits to the face sealing the boundary table 16 however the compliance will be affected by how comfortable is mask-wearing3 especially for a long-term use hepa masks such as kf94 or n95 are more uncomfortable such as demanding tedious cautions table 1 surgical masks are used to protect the operation field from droplets generated from body fluids of users nasal and oral mucosa by talking or coughing table 17 its effectiveness has long been proven in practice although it is loose-fitting allowing possible leakage of aerosol droplets through open boundaries8 homemade masks made of cotton also have significantly reduced droplet and particle transmission when coughing but their efficiency is only one third of surgical masks9 the surgical mask is a pleated rectangular three-layer mask efficiently preventing wetting to the outer surface by user generated droplets fig 1 hepa filters are affected by the moisture in the exhaled air10 and it is not recommended to use single mask for longer than 4 hours2 when the more tightly the hepa mask fits to the face droplets will be better contained inside it and will break the mask filter faster10 if symptomatic patients wear the hepa mask properly-fitted they are possibly suffocated by own secretions otherwise the mask will be unsealed and uselessin conclusion a surgical mask is the best type for a person wearing a mask to prevent the droplet transmission with or without symptoms a cotton mask rather than a hepa mask can be the last resort for the person without respiratory symptomsthe novel coronavirus 2019-ncov emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 and has rapidly spread across the world gates 2020 zhu et al 2020 in february 2020 the world health organization who renamed this epidemic disease coronavirus disease covid-19 as it is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the number of covid-19 cases has rapidly increased worldwide who 2020 del rio  malani 2020 as of 29 february 2020 there were 85403 confirmed covid-19 cases and 2924 fatalities across 49 countries who 2020 dong du  gardner 2020 although the emerging threat of covid-19 has drawn global attention the optimal strategies to reduce the spread of disease remain largely undetermined day 2020several studies have investigated the virology transmission risk factors and protection associated with covid-19 chen et al 2020a guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wu  mcgoogan 2020 yang et al 2020 covid-19 spreads by human-to-human transmission primarily through respiratory droplets and direct contact with groups of infected family members friends colleagues or medical health workers however even asymptomatic patients can be a source of infection covid-19 has dramatically higher rates of transmission compared to sars and middle east respiratory syndrome but an observed lower fatality rate the median age of covid-19 patients ranged from 47 to 56 years old approximately 65 of patients were male and 35 were female approximately 237 of adult covid-19 patients have at least one of the following coexisting underlying chronic illnesses cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus hypertension or chronic obstructive lung disease the most common reported symptoms are fever 438 on admission and 887 during hospitalization dry cough 678 dyspnea 187 myalgia 149 headache 136 diarrhea 38 sore throat 139 nasal obstruction 48 and fatigue 381 the optimal infectious control measurements for covid-19 have not yet been established razai et al 2020covid-19 is continuing to dramatically spread across many countries who 2020 however taiwan has a relatively lower rate of infected cases after the first diagnosed case in taiwan on 21 january 2020 39 cases were confirmed as of 29 february 2020 some cases were imported by travelers and others were within families we conducted this study to summarize the epidemiological characteristics of the 39 cases and to propose technological advances and infectious control measurements that may contribute to reducing disease spread chen et al 2020b wang ng  brook 2020 we also discuss some of the taiwanese public healths and hospitals responses to covid-19we conducted this retrospective observational study at the end of february 2020 to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of the first 39 confirmed covid-19 cases in taiwan the taiwan centers for disease control tcdc enforced many policies to combat the spread of covid-19 taiwan centers for disease control 2020 the epidemiological data of the confirmed cases were released to the public although the identifiable data were encrypted the clinical presentations and epidemiological relationships were reported and data regarding demographics clinical symptoms contact history and onset dates were extracted we summarized the public data to show the clinical characteristics of the 39 casessince covid-19 is considered a communicable disease in taiwan all suspected cases are required to be reported to the tcdc the clinical covid-19 diagnostic criteria include a history of travel or residence in endemic areas contact with confirmed cases contact with cases of fever or respiratory symptoms radiological image characteristics of pneumonia and clinical manifestations of fever or respiratory tract symptoms early diagnosis and timely containment are important the tcdcs diagnostic testing criterion included 1 patients from endemic areas with respiratory symptoms 2 patients with unexplained pneumonia or community pneumonia and poor responses to antibiotic treatment 3 patients in close contact with confirmed cases and 4 cluster infections or unwell people in specific workplaces such as hospitals or nurseries the defined endemic areas varied over timesuspected cases were confirmed by nucleic acid detection from the sputum throat swab lower respiratory tract secretion or blood samples the polymerase chain reaction for covid-19 and other viruses were performed cui li  shi 2019 lin et al 2020 lu et al 2020 the lancet 2020 the suspected cases were isolated in negative pressure rooms or single bedrooms until a second negative test resultsince there is no specific treatment for covid-19 the main treatments used are supportive care and oxygen support who 2020 taiwan centers for disease control 2020 suspected or confirmed cases were moved to isolated rooms and received supportive treatment to ensure electrolyte balance closely monitored vital signs and oxygen saturation routine blood tests and arterial blood gas analyses were administered if necessary chest imaging and other procedures were arranged patients with pneumonia received intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics such as penicillin or ceftriaxone and oseltamivir was also administered empirically for confirmed cases they could leave isolation and return home after three consecutive negative pcr tests in average it took approximately 1 month to achieve the criteria of de-isolation thus the capacity of isolated rooms was an important issuewidespread anxiety is anticipated when facing a novel and unknown infection the lancet 2020 the tcdc executed several policies but individual hospitals were authorized to implement their own infective control measurements against covid-19 in addition to their normal practices for example decreasing exposure was important to reduce disease spread and hospitalized patients are susceptible to various kinds of infectious diseases including covid-19 to reduce viral transmission hospitals set up outdoor clinics to care for patients with travel or contact histories we investigated other important health polices and hospital responseswe summarized cumulative cases from other asian countries starting in mid-february fig 1 by the end of february 2020 2150 patients in taiwan had been tested for covid-19 among them 39 18 patients tested positive for sars-cov-2 the epidemiological characteristics of the 39 confirmed cases are summarized in table 1 sixteen 410 patients were male and 23 590 were female approximately half 538 of these patients were between 41 and 60 years old nineteen cases 487 had a history of overseas travel or residence or had visited china fifteen 385 of the confirmed cases had direct contact transmission from infected family members one patient 26 died the tcdc aggressively tracked the travel occupation contact and cluster histories of the confirmed cases the correlations among the 39 cases were plotted and publicly released fig 2hospitals designated separate entrances and exits for patients and the public to prevent hospital-acquired covid-19 infections suspected cases were treated separately from the emergency and outpatient cases throughout the duration of their hospital stay when scheduling appointments online the tracking and management mechanism for people under infection risk announcement appeared fig 3 if patients had any history of travel to endemic areas or of respiratory infection they were guided to a special covid-19 outdoor clinic fig 4suspected cases were guided to an outdoor triage and then admitted to an isolation room diagnostic tests were performed in negative pressure rooms or single bedrooms hand sanitizer masks and covid-19-related posters were posted at the hospital entrances patients and visitors had to wash their hands with alcohol hand gel before entering the hospital these infectious control measurements all contributed to reducing hospital-acquired infectionshospital visits are common in asian cultures so hospitals in taiwan restricted visits to prevent covid-19 infections and outbreaks instead of face-to-face hospital visits video calls were recommended for family and friends to contact patients ward entrances were controlled by electromagnetic doors requiring access cards patients were not allowed in restricted areas no more than two visitors were allowed to visit the same patient at the same time visitors with recent travel histories were restricted from entering the hospital fig 5 in the case of a confirmed infection visitor registration provided clues for tracking the infectious source and their contactssurgical masks are basic protections that prevent human-to-human transmission of covid-19 taiwanese people tend to wear masks in large and crowded gathering areas in their daily lives to protect themselves and others in order to prevent public over-purchase and hoarding the taiwanese government took actions to recruit the mask factories and allocate all masks the government helped factories upgrade their facilities and mask production increased from 1 million per day in early february to 10 million per day in late february the taiwanese government issued surgical masks to all local hospitals and clinics to prevent shortages each medical staff member received one to two masks every day for regular use and additional masks or n95 masks were provided for healthcare providers taking care of covid-19 patients or performing invasive procedures moreover the government provided surgical masks for susceptible populations such as patients with cancer hemodialysis or those undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy upon hospital admission one mask was given to patients with reduced nosocomial infection or hospital-acquired infection to reduce community transmission the government also issued surgical masks to children taiwanese residents needed to present a national health insurance card to purchase surgical masks from local pharmacies and primary healthcare units this policy allowed each residence to purchase two masks weekly and prohibited repeat purchasessuspected and confirmed cases were admitted to their own rooms to ensure isolation in order to minimize infections of healthcare providers nursing staff adhered to group scheduling and fixed shifting separated by meal breaks job and ward rotations were prohibited to reduce the chances of hospital-acquired transmissioncovid-19 is a global health threat but taiwan has a relatively lower rate of infection compared to other countries approximately 50 of taiwans 39 confirmed cases were imported and 385 were infected by their own families aggressive tracking and epidemiological surveillance strategies contributed to identifying infectious sources and reducing disease spread furthermore infectious control measurements in hospitals may have reduced the transmission of covid-19there are no established best strategies against covid-19 and policies differ across populations geographic regions cultures countries and time lockdown was a powerful strategy used by china to isolate infected people and reduce transmission but it is not easily replicated in many countries the united kingdoms herd immunity strategy also caught our attention yong 2020 however taiwans close proximity to and frequent interactions with china suggest that following the uks strategy could result in the collapse of the medical system moreover convenience in traveling contributed to virus transmission thus disease spread was almost inevitable the rapid spread of covid-19 had been observed in uk and the herd immunity strategy had been abandoned the uk government made efforts towards containment to slow down the virus transmission boyle 2020 we were still exploring the appropriate strategies to tackle covid-19 in different situationsaggressive control measurements in taiwan helped flatten the infectious curve prevent medical collapse and reduce case fatality rates for example there were 1300 isolation rooms with an occupancy rate of approximately 70 in february 2020 taiwan centers for disease control 2020 adequate isolation rooms ensured adequate containment and reduced the risk of community infections furthermore wearing masks is already prevalent in taiwanese society and masks provide simple and direct protection against droplet infection leung et al 2020 wearing masks has not been a common practice in other countries desai  mehrotra 2020 taiwans aggressive strategies ensured the provision of adequate masks decreasing both anxiety among the public and disease spreadalthough the culture and population density of japan are relatively similar to taiwans japans situation was more complicated they faced the complex issues with the diamond princess cruise ship carrying infected patients quarantined in the port of yokohama japan and the olympics and they used different strategies to combat covid-19 gallego et al 2020 montanari 2020 optimal strategies varied across different countries and changed over timethe covid-19 pandemic is a rapidly changing situation according to a study by the chinese cdc the majority of infected people are aged 3079 years 87 in taiwans 39 confirmed cases 35 90 were aged 3079 years taiwans case fatality rate 139 256 was similar to chinas 102344672 23 wu  mcgoogan 2020 approximately half of taiwanese patients 1939 487 had an overseas travel history but the high risk of community infection should not be ignored family and ward clusters are important transmission sources and 22 people across five families were identified in the 39 reported cases the high contagiousness of sars-cov-2 makes disease prevention difficult moreover 81 of infected patients reported mild symptoms which were easily overlooked leading to delayed diagnoses bai et al 2020 rothe et al 2020 aggressive tracking and infectious source identification lead to early quarantine transmission prevention and early diagnoses of patients with mild symptomsalthough sars-cov-2s complete route of transmission has not been completely identified it is mainly spread via droplets and physical contact li et al 2020 lu liu  jia 2020 xu et al 2020 wearing masks and washing hands are essential and effective in preventing the spread of infectious disease leung lam  cheng 2020 macintyre  chughtai 2015 public panic is expected when an emerging disease appears likely to become endemic or a widespread epidemic bao et al 2020 medley  vassall 2017 leading to a shortage of masks and increased risk of disease transmission the tcdcs mask policy is an executable and effective strategy to combat disease furthermore hospitals implementing visitation restrictions and outdoor clinics may also reduce the risk of covid-19 transmissiontechnological advances also contribute to improvements in infection control big data analytics new technology and proactive testing have been applied in the war against covid-19 wang ng  brook 2020 a real-time interactive internet dashboard has also been utilized to provide timely information for the general public and healthcare providers dong du  gardner 2020 these strategies are believed to be beneficial in preventing and controlling disease spread we summarized some additional hospital responses and provided photographs for healthcare providers reference figs 1 3 4 and 5our study had some limitations first covid-19 is a communicable disease and universal screening is not currently available the number of patients with mild symptoms may be underestimated second since sars-cov-2s virology transmission incubation period and contagious period are not fully understood the most effective strategies to use against covid-19 remain speculative more studies are required to investigate the effectiveness of individual infectious control measurementsthe emergence of covid-19 is a critical global issue taiwans 39 confirmed cases showed a similar age distribution as previous studies guan et al 2020 the role of family and ward clusters in disease transmission was emphasized public health and hospitals patient route control outdoor clinics hospital visit restrictions mask regulations and ward and staff modification strategies may contribute to reducing the transmission of covid-19this paper proposes three mask improvement designs for both general users and hospital staff to reduce the chance of face mask contact transmission influenza virus infection occurs through contact transmission between people infectious diseases can spread through droplets respiratory aerosols or direct and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces the effectiveness of face masks in disease prevention has been verified through research1 macintyre et al examined the effect of surgical masks and handwashing on the prevention of influenza transmission2 public compliance with infection control measures is crucial if a large number of people use masks during a severe pandemic the spread of the epidemic is reduced reducing exposure can reduce the spread of disease in public places such as schools cauchemez et al 3 have shown that holidays lead to a 20-29 reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children in school face mask comfort is a key to public compliance with infection control measures in a survey by purdy4 participants were asked to use a likert scale of 1-6 to assess the n95 filtering facepiece respirator ffr based on fitness temperature and respiratory comfort4 in terms of discomfort warmth and breathing comfort fitness was rated the most important and two-dimensional patterns expanded the mask area to cover the facial contours for individualsthe use of reusable cloth masks is widespread particularly when surgical face masks are scarce but there is no clinical guidance regarding their use many people repeatedly use a mask every day and the masks are repeatedly donned and doffed placing their users at risk of contact transmission masks are often placed in a purse or pocket further compromising their cleanliness 5 people feel using a face mask is uncomfortably humid and inconvenient for inhalation in a previous evaluation of mask contact diffusion individuals who donned and doffed a face mask during a simple task polluted an average area of 530 square centimeters 6a novel coronavirus was eventually identified on 1 january 2020 who had set up the imst incident management support team across the three levels of the organization7 virus can be transmitted even during the incubation period as a result asymptomatic carriers may still pass the disease to other people some patients exhibit normal temperatures and there are many milder cases medical practitioners are required to wear complete protective equipment when large numbers of patients flood into the emergency room if the face mask is removed while going to the restroom or drinking water this protective suit may be contaminated in a situation with limited resources it is essential to take care of ones physiological needs without contaminationtaiwan has so far managed to prevent a large scale community outbreak city forces wearing face masks on public transportation and keep social distancing to stem the virus from spreading when asked by fox news reporter gates highlighted taiwan as an exemplary country because it quickly8 identified the problem and initiated community-wide testing early on and reduced the disease burdentaiwan had learned valuable lessons from the sars outbreak in 2003 a centralized cecc command center led the actions and resource allocation and the necessity to be highly skeptical of data and information when an explosion begins the central epidemic command center cecc announced standards for the suspension of classes high schools and below will shut down for 14 days based on following rules i if one teacher or student is listed as a confirmed case of covid-19 by the cecc their classes will be suspended ii if two or more teachers or students are confirmed to have contracted the disease all courses in the entire school will be suspended iii if one-third of schools in a township or city shut down due to infections all schools will be closedthe coronavirus is spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person commuters are particularly at risk since they travel with large crowds in enclosed spaces and subway handrails may spread the virus through contact transmission910 there is also a risk of the virus adhering to the car doors and elevator buttons people cannot avoid the germs that touch their hands and masks which puts them under substantial psychological and physiological pressurerelevant literature on masks is mainly in the product catalog or patent database lets summarize them separately from belowseveral variations on the standard surgical face mask are currently offered by companies halyard health face masks offer several features and levels of protection the materials and donning attachments are sonically bonded and a nose piece assists the mask in conforming to the contours of the face figure 1 most surgical face masks contain an adjustable iron wire which is bent with finger pressure to fix its shape close to the bridge of the nose this one-dimensional fixation creates a gap when the mask moves figure 1a also shows an adjustable nose bridge design that maintains a closer fit to the users face three charging techniques viz corona charging tribocharging and electrostatic fiber spinning were used to charge fibers or fabrics of different polymer types11 electrostatic charging technology enables regular masks to filter more air particlesfigure 1b shows an extended surgical mask designed with respiratory comfort concerns in mind a flat-fold design protects against airborne biological particles and serves as a respirator the three-panel low-profile n95 particulate respirator mask features a soft cover and nose clip the mask is opened by pulling up and down and closed in the opposite way however although it is folded vertically the front outer surface is still touchable during donning and doffing many existing product designs are based on considerations of filtering performance and suitability for individual face shapes figure 1c is a design with an elongated elastic restraint a three-dimensional mask increases the protection of the mask and is convenient to carry13
figure 1d shows the upper section and the lower sections are respectively lifted away from the middle to form a three-dimensional shape the sheet is bent along the first fold line and toward the opposite surface to facilitate carrying the packaging of the snack face mask is easily opened for fast use figure 1e the packaging is part of the mask so it does not come into contact with the outside world when it is folded although there are different folding methods for each design there is no product that can avoid outer layer contact completelythe elongated hexagon-shaped portion of the face mask has a clear surface13 another patent features a gathered peripheral bottom which provides an air-tight seal under the face14 greenblat15 proposed a mask with a unique shape design which decreases in volume when folded with a joint style nilsson et al16 proposed a cone-shaped tent structure with forward-extending support with an additional air valve device used to reduce the difficulty of inhalation wang altered the periphery of the breathing area with a compressible gasket and a three-dimensional sealing structure to abut the users face17 a tight seal is necessary between the face and the mask when worn if it is not tight enough contaminants may be inhaled by the user m563890 is a narrow strip mask with reinforced covering18 the m464196 folding three-dimensional mask folds to make a three-dimensional mask with a larger exhalation space19 since the lower edge of the upper mask portion is engaged with the upper edge of the symmetrical mask portion mutual contact is ensured to improve safety after the patent database survey we did not find a model that could completely prevent the outer layer from contacting contaminants after foldingdesign thinking has generated significant attention in the business press and has been heralded as a novel problem solving methodology well suited to the often cited challenges designers face in encouraging innovation20 the solid background of knowledge help starts to think alternative ways to view the problem after the team member identifies innovative solutions the prototype is used to redefine one or further problemsli21 proposed six rules for innovation which used in different fields such as advertising commerce engineering and design the six rules are reverse transfer combination reduction change of direction and extension the rules were applied to the development of mask redesign their contents areduring the design process the designer needs to think about possible situations and parameters repeatedly and pick the appropriate settings to reduce the time spent on attempts the design flow is firstly i we look for problems and available materials ii we observe the medical characteristics through a simplified model and iii we try to find appropriate implement way secondly concept drawings provided by the design group and screened based on producibilityin a medical design the designer needs to extend his knowledge through international regulations such as iso mdr and fda the mdr sets high standards for ensuring reliable data are generated from clinical investigations22 recently fda recommendation on device reuse so that developing cost-effective reusable face masks for the public is essential the 510k submission of surgical mask evaluates medical devices for marketing to ensure they are safe and effective ultraviolet germicidal irradiation microwave-generated steaming and dry heating were tested in reducing or inactivating viral and bacterial pathogens23 a costeffective full-face mask was developed to support safety of stuff24 in this urgent need of the epidemic it also urged the creation of improved mask design designers can develop concepts firmly and realize ideas through cross-domain cooperationthrough thinking about the real-life environment situation brainstorming between medical consultants and designers we selected ideas and presented three realistic and feasible ideas belowcaregivers must wear n95 masks before entering closed spaces because the mask isolates the virus from the user via the surface layer touching the mask with hands is dangerous after a sneeze droplets soak through the mask and other individuals have the chance to be infected in addition when caregivers remove their masks to drink water they put themselves at risk of infection design-a aims to reduce mask removal and infection chance during drinking the creative rules applied are reverse-drink water without taking off your mask transfer-transfer the pet cap to the mask extension-drink water with an extension straw medical staff can drink water safely and conveniently without removing their masks a water bag will engage the inlet on the front of the cover figure 2 the flange of the water bag can be extended to the users lips and the water outlet does not touch the outer surface of the mask while drinking which avoids the risk of contact transmissionafter taking off their masks most subjects carry them in purses or pockets the hands touch the contaminated areas on the mask and the outer edge of the mask also touch the interior of the purse or pocket therefore it is crucial to minimize the chances of contacting the outer edge of the mask design-b can be folded in a w shape so that the outer part of the mask faces inward and reduces contact transmission figure 3a when the mask is unfolded a three-dimensional convex surface is formed over the nose figure 3 bc which increases the available area for inhalation the creative rules applied are reverse- change of direction outer surface facing inward transfertechniques of origami reduction- reduce the chance of hand contactbecause people often do not wear masks when going out design-c figure 4 combines the mask with the brim of a cap the design usually acts as a hat and when needed the user pulls down the headband which is made of a flexible material at this time the mask and the brim form a sizeable three-dimensional space and it is easy for the user to breathe with a large area of air intake when the mask is doffed and folded the user holds the headband of the cap to avoid contact transmission the creative rules applied are reverse- cap front edge elastic can be pulled down combine- mask combines with hat change direction- pull down extension- increase front end sizea major epidemic makes people aware of the importance of avoiding contact and related improvements have distributed in local market the design-d figure 5a added a breathable thin cloth cover outside the mask the outer surface of the cover is in contact with the virus and the inner surface is in contact with the mouth foam after using for a period of time remove the cover to wash and dry to increase the use time of the mask figure 5b shows a foldable box after removing the mask the outer surface folds inwards place the mask in the protective shell with an elastic band to close the protective shell and put it in the pocket this avoids the opportunity for the outside of the mask to contact the body and clothing the creative rules applied are reverse- mask with another mask combination- mask combines with package change direction- the outer surface facing inward to reduce contactthe current coronavirus epidemic has increased the need for face masks and respirators that can be used without increasing the chances of contact transmission residents who live in affected areas are at risk of infection from close contact with other residents especially during their daily commute in addition it is nearly impossible to avoid contact with pathogens on face masks and hands current face mask patent designs do not protect the outer layer of the mask from outside pathogens after they have been foldedas a result we propose three improved mask designs to reduce the chances of infection from direct contact design-a features a mask with a water channel which allows the user to remain hydrated without removing the mask design-b has a folding pattern which hides the outer mask surface and reduces contact transmission design-c combines the mask with the brim of a cap the mask and the brim form an extended air-intake area for easier breathing the design-d shows related improvements distributed in local market which reduce the chance of mask contact with users body and clothing an epidemic makes us aware of the detail living behaviors which strengthen public healthas of may 28 2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has infected more than 585 million individuals worldwide and caused more than 359 000 deaths1 emergency lockdowns have been initiated in countries across the globe and the effect on health wellbeing business and other aspects of daily life are felt throughout societies and by individuals with no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccine available in the imminent future reducing the rate of infection ie flattening the curve is a priority and prevention of infection is the best approach to achieve this aimsars-cov-2 spreads person-to-person through close contact and causes covid-19 it has not been solved if sars-cov-2 might spread through aerosols from respiratory droplets so far air sampling has found virus rna in some studies2 3 4 but not in others5 6 7 8 however finding rna virus is not necessarily indicative of replication-competent and infection-competent viable virus that could be transmissible the distance from a patient that the virus is infective and the optimum person-to-person physical distance is uncertain for the currently foreseeable future ie until a safe and effective vaccine or treatment becomes available covid-19 prevention will continue to rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions including pandemic mitigation in community settings9 thus quantitative assessment of physical distancing is relevant to inform safe interaction and care of patients with sars-cov-2 in both health-care and non-health-care settings the definition of close contact or potentially exposed helps to risk stratify contact trace and develop guidance documents but these definitions differ around the globe
research in context
evidence before this study
we searched 21 databases and resources from inception to may 3 2020 with no restriction by language for studies of any design evaluating physical distancing face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of the viruses that cause covid-19 and related diseases eg severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers between infected individuals and people close to them eg household members caregivers and health-care workers previous related meta-analyses have focused on randomised trials and reported imprecise data for common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza rather than the pandemic and epidemic betacoronaviruses causative of covid-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 sars sars-cov or mers mers-cov other meta-analyses have focused on interventions in the health-care setting and have not included non-health-care eg community settings our search did not retrieve any systematic review of information on physical distancing face masks or eye protection to prevent transmission of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov
added value of this study
we did a systematic review of 172 observational studies in health-care and non-health-care settings across 16 countries and six continents 44 comparative studies were included in a meta-analysis including 25 697 patients with covid-19 sars or mers our findings are to the best of our knowledge the first to rapidly synthesise all direct information on covid-19 and therefore provide the best available evidence to inform optimum use of three common and simple interventions to help reduce the rate of infection and inform non-pharmaceutical interventions including pandemic mitigation in non-health-care settings physical distancing of 1 m or more was associated with a much lower risk of infection as was use of face masks including n95 respirators or similar and surgical or similar masks eg 1216-layer cotton or gauze masks and eye protection eg goggles or face shields added benefits are likely with even larger physical distances eg 2 m or more based on modelling and might be present with n95 or similar respirators versus medical masks or similar across 24 studies in health-care and non-health-care settings of contextual factors to consider when formulating recommendations most stakeholders found these personal protection strategies acceptable feasible and reassuring but noted harms and contextual challenges including frequent discomfort and facial skin breakdown high resource use linked with the potential to decrease equity increased difficulty communicating clearly and perceived reduced empathy of care providers by those they were caring for
implications of all the available evidence
in view of inconsistent guidelines by various organisations based on limited information our findings provide some clarification and have implications for multiple stakeholders the risk for infection is highly dependent on distance to the individual infected and the type of face mask and eye protection worn from a policy and public health perspective current policies of at least 1 m physical distancing seem to be strongly associated with a large protective effect and distances of 2 m could be more effective these data could also facilitate harmonisation of the definition of exposed eg within 2 m which has implications for contact tracing the quantitative estimates provided here should inform disease-modelling studies which are important for planning pandemic response efforts policy makers around the world should strive to promptly and adequately address equity implications for groups with currently limited access to face masks and eye protection for health-care workers and administrators our findings suggest that n95 respirators might be more strongly associated with protection from viral transmission than surgical masks both n95 and surgical masks have a stronger association with protection compared with single-layer masks eye protection might also add substantial protection for the general public evidence shows that physical distancing of more than 1 m is highly effective and that face masks are associated with protection even in non-health-care settings with either disposable surgical masks or reusable 1216-layer cotton ones although much of this evidence was on mask use within households and among contacts of cases eye protection is typically underconsidered and can be effective in community settings however no intervention even when properly used was associated with complete protection from infection other basic measures eg hand hygiene are still needed in addition to physical distancing and use of face masks and eye protection
to contain widespread infection and to reduce morbidity and mortality among health-care workers and others in contact with potentially infected people jurisdictions have issued conflicting advice about physical or social distancing use of face masks with or without eye protection to achieve additional protection is debated in the mainstream media and by public health authorities in particular the use of face masks for the general population10 moreover optimum use of face masks in health-care settings which have been used for decades for infection prevention is facing challenges amid personal protective equipment ppe shortages11
any recommendations about social or physical distancing and the use of face masks should be based on the best available evidence evidence has been reviewed for other respiratory viral infections mainly seasonal influenza12 13 but no comprehensive review is available of information on sars-cov-2 or related betacoronaviruses that have caused epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or middle east respiratory syndrome mers we therefore systematically reviewed the effect of physical distance face masks and eye protection on transmission of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-covto inform who guidance documents on march 25 2020 we did a rapid systematic review14 we created a large international collaborative and we used cochrane methods15 and the grade approach16 we prospectively submitted the systematic review protocol for registration on prospero crd42020177047 appendix pp 2329 we have followed prisma17 and moose18 reporting guidelines appendix pp 3033from database inception to may 3 2020 we searched for studies of any design and in any setting that included patients with who-defined confirmed or probable covid-19 sars or mers and people in close contact with them comparing distances between people and covid-19 infected patients of 1 m or larger with smaller distances with or without a face mask on the patient or with or without a face mask eye protection or both on the exposed individual the aim of our systematic review was for quantitative assessment to ascertain the physical distance associated with reduced risk of acquiring infection when caring for an individual infected with sars-cov-2 sars-cov or mers-cov our definition of face masks included surgical masks and n95 respirators among others eye protection included visors faceshields and goggles among otherswe searched up to march 26 2020 medline using the ovid platform pubmed embase cinahl using the ovid platform the cochrane library covid-19 open research dataset challenge covid-19 research database who epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews addressing mers and sars and its covid-19 living overview of the evidence platform eppi centre living systematic map of the evidence clinicaltrialsgov who international clinical trials registry platform relevant documents on the websites of governmental and other relevant organisations reference lists of included papers and relevant systematic reviews19 20 we handsearched up to may 3 2020 preprint servers biorxiv medrxiv and social science research network first look and coronavirus resource centres of the lancet jama and n engl j med appendix pp 35 we did not limit our search by language we initially could not obtain three full texts for evaluation but we obtained them through interlibrary loan or contacting a study author we did not restrict our search to any quantitative cutoff for distancewe screened titles and abstracts reviewed full texts extracted data and assessed risk of bias by two authors and independently using standardised prepiloted forms covidence veritas health innovation melbourne vic australia and we cross-checked screening results using artificial intelligence evidence prime hamilton on canada we resolved disagreements by consensus we extracted data for study identifier study design setting population characteristics intervention and comparator characteristics quantitative outcomes source of funding and reported conflicts of interests ethics approval study limitations and other important commentsoutcomes of interest were risk of transmission ie who-defined confirmed or probable covid-19 sars or mers to people in health-care or non-health-care settings by those infected hospitalisation intensive care unit admission death time to recovery adverse effects of interventions and contextual factors such as acceptability feasibility effect on equity and resource considerations related to the interventions of interest however data were only available to analyse intervention effects for transmission and contextual factors consistent with who studies generally defined confirmed cases with laboratory confirmation with or without symptoms and probable cases with clinical evidence of the respective infection ie suspected to be infected but for whom confirmatory testing either had not yet been done for any reason or was inconclusiveour search did not identify any randomised trials of covid-19 sars or mers we did a meta-analysis of associations by pooling risk ratios rrs or adjusted odds ratios aors depending on availability of these data from observational studies using dersimonian and laird random-effects models we adjusted for variables including age sex and severity of source case these variables were not the same across studies because between-study heterogeneity can be misleadingly large when quantified by i

we analysed data for subgroup effects by virus type intervention different distances or face mask types and setting health care vs non-health care among the studies assessing physical distancing measures to prevent viral transmission the intervention varied eg direct physical contact 0 m 1 m or 2 m we therefore analysed the effect of distance on the size of the associations by random-effects univariate meta-regressions using restricted maximum likelihood and we present mean effects and 95 cis we calculated tests for interaction using a minimum of 10 000 monte carlo random permutations to avoid spurious findings30 we formally assessed the credibility of potential effect-modifiers using grade guidance21 we did two sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings first we used bayesian meta-analyses to reinterpret the included studies considering priors derived from the effect point estimate and variance from a meta-analysis of ten randomised trials evaluating face mask use versus no face mask use to prevent influenza-like illness in health-care workers31 second we used bayesian meta-analyses to reinterpret the efficacy of n95 respirators versus medical masks on preventing influenza-like illness after seasonal viral mostly influenza infection13 for these sensitivity analyses we used hybrid metropolis-hastings and gibbs sampling a 10 000 sample burn-in 40 000 markov chain monte carlo samples and we tested non-informative and sceptical priors eg four time variance32 33 to inform mean estimates of effect 95 credibility intervals cris and posterior distributions we used non-informative hyperpriors to estimate statistical heterogeneity model convergence was confirmed in all cases with good mixing in visual inspection of trace plots autocorrelation plots histograms and kernel density estimates in all scenarios parameters were blocked leading to acceptance of approximately 50 and efficiency greater than 1 in all cases typically about 40 we did analyses using stata version 143the funder contributed to defining the scope of the review but otherwise had no role in study design and data collection data were interpreted and the report drafted and submitted without funder input but according to contractual agreement the funder provided review at the time of final publication the corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationwe identified 172 studies for our systematic review from 16 countries across six continents figure 1

recognize as an aspect of health worker safety the precautionary principle that reasonable action to reduce risk such as the use of a fitted n95 respirator need not await scientific certainty80

if we do not learn from sars and we do not make the government fix the problems that remain we will pay a terrible price in the next pandemic81
a counter viewpoint is that the scientific uncertainty and contextual considerations require a more nuanced approach although challenging policy makers must carefully consider these two viewpoints along with our findingswe found evidence of moderate certainty that current policies of at least 1 m physical distancing are probably associated with a large reduction in infection and that distances of 2 m might be more effective as implemented in some countries we also provide estimates for 3 m the main benefit of physical distancing measures is to prevent onward transmission and thereby reduce the adverse outcomes of sars-cov-2 infection hence the results of our current review support the implementation of a policy of physical distancing of at least 1 m and if feasible 2 m or more our findings also provide robust estimates to inform models and contact tracing used to plan and strategise for pandemic response efforts at multiple levelsthe use of face masks was protective for both health-care workers and people in the community exposed to infection with both the frequentist and bayesian analyses lending support to face mask use irrespective of setting our unadjusted analyses might at first impression suggest use of face masks in the community setting to be less effective than in the health-care setting but after accounting for differential n95 respirator use between health-care and non-health-care settings we did not detect any striking differences in effectiveness of face mask use between settings the credibility of effect-modification across settings was therefore low wearing face masks was also acceptable and feasible policy makers at all levels should therefore strive to address equity implications for groups with currently limited access to face masks and eye protection one concern is that face mask use en masse could divert supplies from people at highest risk for infection10 health-care workers are increasingly being asked to ration and reuse ppe82 83 leading to calls for government-directed repurposing of manufacturing capacity to overcome mask shortages84 and finding solutions for mask use by the general public84 in this respect some of the masks studied in our review were reusable 1216-layer cotton or gauze masks51 54 61 75 at the moment although there is consensus that sars-cov-2 mainly spreads through large droplets and contact debate continues about the role of aerosol2 3 4 5 6 7 8 85 86 but our meta-analysis provides evidence albeit of low certainty that respirators might have a stronger protective effect than surgical masks biological plausibility would be supported by data for aerosolised sars-cov-25 6 7 8 and preclinical data showing seasonal coronavirus rna detection in fine aerosols during tidal breathing87 albeit rna detection does not necessarily imply replication and infection-competent virus nevertheless our findings suggest it plausible that even in the absence of aerosolisation respirators might be simply more effective than masks at preventing infection at present there is no data to support viable virus in the air outside of aerosol generating procedures from available hospital studies other factors such as super-spreading events the subtype of health-care setting eg emergency room intensive care unit medical wards dialysis centre if aerosolising procedures are done and environmental factors such as ventilation might all affect the degree of protection afforded by personal protection strategies but we did not identify robust data to inform these aspectsstrengths of our review include adherence to full systematic review methods which included artificial intelligence-supported dual screening of titles and abstracts full-text evaluation assessment of risk of bias and no limitation by language we included patients infected with sars-cov-2 sars-cov or mers-cov and searched relevant data up to may 3 2020 we followed the grade approach16 to rate the certainty of evidence finally we identified and appraise a large body of published work from china from which much evidence emerged before the pandemic spread to other global regionsthe primary limitation of our study is that all studies were non-randomised not always fully adjusted and might suffer from recall and measurement bias eg direct contact in some studies might not be measuring near distance however unadjusted adjusted frequentist and bayesian meta-analyses all supported the main findings and large or very large effects were recorded nevertheless we are cautious not to be overly certain in the precise quantitative estimates of effects although the qualitative effect and direction is probably of high certainty many studies did not provide information on precise distances and direct contact was equated to 0 m distance none of the eligible studies quantitatively evaluated whether distances of more than 2 m were more effective although our meta-regression provides potential predictions for estimates of risk few studies assessed the effect of interventions in non-health-care settings and they primarily evaluated mask use in households or contacts of cases although beneficial associations were seen across settings furthermore most evidence was from studies that reported on sars and mers n6674 patients with covid-19 of 25 697 total but data from these previous epidemics provide the most direct information for covid-19 currently we did not specifically assess the effect of duration of exposure on risk for transmission although whether or not this variable was judged a risk factor considerably varied across studies from any duration to a minimum of 1 h because of inconsistent reporting information is limited about whether aerosol-generating procedures were in place in studies using respirators and whether masks worn by infected patients might alter the effectiveness of each intervention although the stronger association with n95 or similar respirators over other masks persisted when adjusting for studies reporting aerosol-generating medical procedures these factors might account for some of the residual statistical heterogeneity seen for some outcomes albeit i
2 is commonly inflated in meta-analyses of observational data21 22 and nevertheless the effects seen were large and probably clinically important in all adjusted studiesour comprehensive systematic review provides the best available information on three simple and common interventions to combat the immediate threat of covid-19 while new evidence on pharmacological treatments vaccines and other personal protective strategies is being generated physical distancing of at least 1 m is strongly associated with protection but distances of up to 2 m might be more effective although direct evidence is limited the optimum use of face masks in particular n95 or similar respirators in health-care settings and 1216-layer cotton or surgical masks in the community could depend on contextual factors action is needed at all levels to address the paucity of better evidence eye protection might provide additional benefits globally collaborative and well conducted studies including randomised trials of different personal protective strategies are needed regardless of the challenges but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence could be considered to inform interim guidanceon 23 february 2020 the lockdown of wuhan in china finally caught peoples attention and alarmed the public all over the world the novel virus coronaviruses is one of the members of the family coronaviridae and has been identified in both avian hosts and various mammals since coronaviruses were considered as pathogens that only cause mild disease people previously failed to pay enough attention until the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov 4sars-cov is one of 36 coronaviruses in the family coronaviridae within the order nidovirales the demand for consumption of animal proteins allowed for the transmission from animals to humans 5 the animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission as well as the lack of awareness in controlling infection resulted in a large-scale spread over 8000 people with a fatality rate of 10 in southern china in 2003 horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for sars-cov-like viruses and civets can amplify the host and facilitate the transmissionanother member of the family coronaviridae is the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which was first reported by saudi arabia in 2012 6 mers coronaviruses can cause both human and veterinary outbreaks due to the ability of coronaviruses to recombine mutate and transmit between animals symptomatic mers-cov has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days and symptoms include respiratory and enteric disease training and milking of camels have been associated with mers-cov infection and people that consume raw camel milk or improperly cooked meat have a high risk of contracting mers-cov the camel birthing season may result in the seasonal pattern of cases which has a peak each year between april and juneall three types of the coronavirus have shown to be a severe acute respiratory syndrome however sars-cov-2 has a lower fatality rate of 23 while sars-cov and mers-cov have 10 and 36 respectively the key host for sars-cov-2 is bats however the intermediate zoonotic sources need to be identified the most common signs and symptoms for people with covid-19 are fever and cough fever was observed in around 90 of infected patients a typical characteristic of covid-19 is pneumonia and people have displayed heterogeneous symptoms such as shortness of breath or dyspnea as well as muscle ache sars-cov-2 can be transmitted human-to-human and is mainly through indirect or direct contact with mucous membranes in the mouth eyes or nose figure 1a the droplets from coughing can penetrate the human body via nose or mouth sars-cov-2 has a higher transmission rate than sars-cov probably due to the genetic recombinant event in covid-19 sars-cov-2 also has an incubation period from 3 to 7 days but it could be as long as 24 days in rare cases 4the chain of coronavirus infection happens when one person infects another and the cycle keeps going this chain breaks when a significant proportion of the population has immunity against the viral or bacterial disease through what is known as herd immunity 78 this technique remains ineffective for all diseases such that the human body develops immunity against certain disorders after the first infection or sometimes through vaccination the same pattern applies to the newly emerging viral infection covid-19 due to the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus figure 1b however the biggest concern for covid-19 is the balance between the natural rate of disease transmission and social distancing principles such that the population acquires herd immunity after it gets significantly exposed to the virus that facilitates the elimination of the pandemic however with the strict social distancing guidelines the population remains unexposed to the virus to develop herd immunity lastly a recently developed framework termed as shield immunity builds a pandemic recovery based on central interactions of recovered individuals exhibiting no virus but with their antibodies detected in serological tests 9 the shield immunity concept has the potential to enrich safer social networks through substitution of interactions to control the evolving dynamics of pandemicsdrug repurposing against covid-19 recent drug discovery efforts have repurposed drugs that were previously used for other health conditions to treat covid-19 and in particular the combination of anti-malaria drugs including food and drug administration fda-approved drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine 1011 however these drugs may not be suitable for covid-19 treatment because of their narrow therapeutic window such that the difference between the effective dose and the toxic dose is significantly small given that there is not enough strong clinical data to support the alleged benefits from these drugs it can worsen symptoms associated with covid-19 there have been prior attempts to use antimalarial drugs in controlling other viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis c for example the antimalarial drug ferroquine was proven to be a strong inhibitor of the hepatitis c virus while another antimalarial drug chloroquine showed weak efficacy against hiv infection 121314 although antimalarial drugs can be effective against a number of viral infections their response varies for all viruses and conditions thereby more clinical trials are needed to judge the ability of antimalarial drugs in treating covid-19 patients to further understand the potential benefits and risks of these drugs for example the washington university school of medicine in st louis recently launched a clinical trial to test the efficacy of the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with another drug the antibiotic azithromycin 15 these drugs are currently being tested on covid-19 hospitalized patients at the barnes-jewish hospitalin addition to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine remdesivir gs-5734 is another drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of covid-19 remdesivir as an inhibitor of the viral rna polymerases has broad-spectrum activity against sars-cov and mers-cov and has been identified as a potential candidate for the treatment of covid-19 a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed on patients that were hospitalized with covid-19 and showed the benefits of remdesivir in improving time to recovery and lowering respiratory tract infection however the trial was implemented in restricted locations and during a time of restricted travel since safety procedures limit the resources research staff often monitored the visits remotely 16 although the compassionate treatment program in another preliminary report for evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir demonstrated 68 of clinical improvement the results were not comparable to that of the other reports due to the lack of randomized trials the interpretation of the results is limited by the lack of viral load data collection a non-uniform duration of therapy and the small size of the cohort 17 therefore these preliminary reports can only provide clinicians the option of remdesivir and further assessments on the safety and efficacy of remdesivir and potential combinations with other therapeutic agents are required via randomized placebo-controlled trialsfavipiravir avigan is another broad-spectrum antiviral drug that works by inhibiting the rna polymerase machinery of rna viruses resulting in a nonviable virus phenotype it was developed by toyama chemical in 2014 through screening chemical libraries for anti-viral activity against the influenza virus and was approved and stockpiled in japan against novel influence pandemics 181920 this drug was recently shown to be effective against other viral diseases including ebola and the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 21 clinical trials in china have led the effort in testing the efficacy of favipiravir in treating covid-19 patients in february 2020 the study showed that favipiravir resulted in a significant decrease in the median time to viral clearance and faster improvement in patients chest computed tomography ct scans 22 however this study was small and non-randomized meaning that it needs to be supported by bigger open-label randomized and controlled clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of favipiravir even though the drug was not initially approved in the usa for the treatment of influenza several clinical trials have been designed to test its efficacy in treatment of covid-19 patients across the entire country 2324similarly ivermectin is an anthelmintic drug that acts on parasites and roundworm infections this drug was shown to be a promising candidate for treating viral diseases including chikungunya and yellow fever 25 several clinical trials are underway after ivermectin was proven to have in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 ivermectin led to significant reduction in viral rna shortly after treatment 26 however the concentrations needed to achieve these promising in vitro results were much higher than those recommended and approved for the treatment of parasitic infections thereby the fda issued a warning against the inappropriate use of ivermectin for the treatment of covid-19 patients 27vaccine development another method to eliminate this pandemic is through vaccines that can solve the problem from its roots by protecting healthy individuals from catching and transferring infections since the genomic data of the novel sars-cov-2 became available in january 2020 there has been an increasing global interest in vaccine development as of april 2020 there have been 115 vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 worldwide 28 a subset of these vaccines is at the clinical phase and are currently being tested on human subjects these vaccine candidates include mrna-1273 from modernatx 29 mrna-1273 utilizes an emerging technology in vaccine development and delivery of a lipid nanoparticle lnp mrna vaccine that encodes for the s protein on the novel sar-cov-2 virus another successful vaccine candidate is ad5-ncov from cansino that is an adenovirus vector encoding for the s protein 30 furthermore ino-4800 was developed by inovio pharmaceuticals which is a dna plasmid that encodes for the s protein of the virus 31 finally the shenzhen geno-immune medical institute developed two vaccine candidates lv-smenp-dc and pathogen-specific apc which are lentiviral vectors designed to express proteins of interest to deactivate the virus 32one of the contributing factors to virus infectivity and virulence is a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement ade ade refers to the viruses binding to specific antibodies of the surface of host cells that enhance their entry and replication this phenomenon was observed in many viruses including the yellow fever virus zika virus and coronaviruses 33 ade can adversely impact the process of vaccine development because vaccines could trigger the production of antibodies that viruses could use to gain access to host cells so the vaccine could worsen the condition that it was designed to fight thus ade is a major potential challenge for covid-19 vaccine development as ade was observed in other types of coronaviruses that resulted in previous pandemics including sars-cov and mers-cov for example there were several vaccine candidates for the sars-cov pandemic including whole inactivated viruses dna subunits and vectored vaccines although these vaccines were able to halt the replication of the sars-cov virus in infected cells they granted viral access to macrophages through ade which eventually caused serious lung infections 3435 the sars vaccine candidates resulted in enhanced hepatitis increased morbidity and stronger inflammatory responses that were attributed to ade 36 similarly the mers-cov virus was shown to utilize the cellular receptors that mimic viral receptors to gain access to host cells resulting in enhanced infection 37 little is known about whether ade will present a challenge to target the sars-cov-2 due to gained access to immune cells or due to prior coronavirus infections and it is currently an active area of investigation 38test results for covid-19 can lead to the initial steps in identifying the scale of the pandemic with the data from the test results mathematical models can be created to aid governors decisions about the length of time for stay-at-home orders previously reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr tests were the diagnostic method of choice however these methods are not ideal for rapid diagnosis due to their long wait times of two to three hours as well as the need for expensive laboratory equipment and trained professionals figure 1cfor the rapid diagnosis of current infection covid-19 testing stations use molecular tests to determine the presence of sars-cov-2 these tests rely on the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2 and use pcr figure 1c under the emergency use authorization eua many labs can utilize their existing machines for detection which vary in terms of multiplexing complexity throughput and turnaround times for example genmarks eplex respiratory pathogen instrument can detect common pathogens in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens cobas sars-cov-2 on the cobas 6800 39 roche molecular diagnostics pleasanton ca usa and xpert xpress sars-cov-2 40 cepheid sunnyvale ca usa give high-volume and automated throughput using the lightmix kit while these devices can use specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs the cobas 6800 takes 35 h and the xpert xpress sars-cov-2 takes 45 min currently abbotts id now a rapid molecular in vitro diagnostic test utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology has a covid-19 feature for testing which takes less than 13 min 41 a nasopharyngeal throat and nasal swab can be used although there is considered to be a sensitivity of 90 with these molecular tests there still stands the risk and repercussions of false-negative tests with these current deviceswith covid-19 being considered a respiratory infection several studies focus on using medical screening lung scans to track the progress of the disease in central healthcare infrastructures one study in wuhan china focused on the progression of covid-19 in the lungs of 81 patients and used ct scans to track the progress 42 all patients with and without symptoms of the viral pneumonia showed abnormal chest cts specifically as bilateral subpleural ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms ill-defined margins and a slight predominance in the lower right lobe as the patient heals the patients lungs show improvements in the lung lesions this medical screening was considered to be quicker and more sensitive than the rt-pcr test a safer way to test for changes in the lungs is via ultrasonography because the evolution of the disease can be tracked to inform clinical decision-making ultrasounds still cannot detect lesions deep within the lung in which case a ct scan would be needed however lung ultrasonography can be the first detection step because it does not use radiation and the detection would be repeatable with lower costs these techniques should be used to evaluate treatment or as a diagnostic test in conjunction with the molecular tests ct scans and ultrasounds require trained personnel and enclosed space making it challenging to consider it as the main diagnostic testfor rapid diagnosis abbott and labcorp looked into mass-producing antibody tests 43 these tests focus on testing for immunoglobulin g igg antibodies because its responses relate to adaptive immunity and have immunological memory of previous virus encounters the presence of these igg antibodies can identify what specific antigen it has a high affinity for and the previous virus is encountered 44 in the context of covid-19 the testing provides information on whether that patient was previously infected and whether immunity was detected or notthe abbott antibody test sars-cov-2 igg assay has shown 100 sensitivity and 999 specificity thus far 45 the abbott test finds whether the patient has igg antibodies for covid-19 which can stay for months to years after a person has recovered one laboratory can run up to 14000 tests per day while abbott previously released a covid-19 molecular test and the id now rapid test this serological test claims to be the most accurate 46 the abbott tests are running on the architect i1000sr and i2000sr laboratory instruments with more than 2000 of these machines in different laboratories this allows for abbott to focus on the distribution of the tests and not the machinery on which to read them 47while abbot is a frontrunner in the production of these antibody tests other corporations are also researching antibody tests for example arcpoint labs has started to offer an antibody test in monterey 48 this test ranks the patient into one of three categories no exposure exposure exposure and recovery currently due to the fdas eua any company can release these tests without testing for accuracy the rate at which these tests come out is high but consumers should still take the necessary precautions that are advised by the cdc 49covid-19 transmission the coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets that are generated by infected individuals during coughing sneezing or speaking while it was initially believed that since these droplets are too heavy to stay in the air the coronavirus is not airborne viruses may be airborne in the form of aerosols which are fine particles that are able to stay in the air for a sustained amount of time a recent study on aerosol and surface stability found that sars-cov-2 was stable for three hours in its aerosol form 50 this indicates that air transmission of the virus is possible due to its capability to remain viable as an aerosol while aerosolized viral particles cannot travel far from an infected patient breathing normally coughing and sneezing can lead to traveling distances up to an estimated 20 feet 51 these particles then remain suspended in the air near or far from their surface depending on how the particles were produced or fall out of the air and attach to surfaces in the case of larger particles figure 2a once these particles have attached to various surfaces the length over which these particulates remain viable depends on the material of the surface under experimental conditions it was found that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 had similar stability times for sars-cov-2 the half lifetimes are aerosol 1 h copper 1 h cardboard 3 h stainless steel 5 h and plastic 7 hmasks in covid-19 transmission individuals have resorted to wearing masks for protection against various viruses but there is much controversy on whether these masks help masks might help keep people with covid-19 from unknowingly transmitting the virus to others and even though there is no harm in wearing masks there is also no clear and significant benefit when patients were asked to cough without masks while wearing a disposable surgical mask and again wearing a 100 cotton mask neither mask meaningfully decreased the viral load coughed onto the petri dishes 52 however surgical masks reduced coronavirus detection in both droplets and aerosols the virus was found in respiratory droplets in 3 out of 10 samples from participants not wearing masks and in aerosols in 4 out of 10 samples taken without masks figure 2b 53 there was no detection of any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks that showed a trend toward reduced detection in respiratory droplets with the use of a mask thus surgical masks reduced the droplets of the virus but not the viral load that gets transmitted to avoid spreading the virus before individuals experience symptoms masks should be used in public venuesseasonal covid-19 transmission concerns have arisen as to whether a second wave of the coronavirus will return and whether the virus is seasonal as societies start to lift lockdown regulations social distancing rules must still be followed until the seasonality of the virus is confirmed current studies and previous research on sars-cov influenza and mers-cov shows that high temperatures and high humidity decrease the spread and transmission of the virus for example sars is likely to stay on surfaces longer when the temperature is below 38 c and humidity is below 95 54 on the other hand influenza stays longer when the temperature is below 30 c and the humidity is below 35 this data suggests that covid-19 is likely to occur during colder seasons such as fall and winter and stay longer in colder climates these studies only show correlations between temperature and humidity as a function of mean viral replication rate figure 2c 55 optimal temperature and humidity conditions of the survival of sars-cov-2 need to be validated over time in the year 2020 and beyond after determining the presence of sars-cov-2 over all seasons countries will be well-informed and prepared to enforce the necessary regulationswith the spread of covid-19 the demand for ppe grew as healthcare workers started following infectious disease protocols and as the individuals began shielding themselves from the virus this necessity first emerged in wuhan china which was met easily by domestic and international partners however as the pandemic spread into europe and the americas it was evident that a shortage of ppe would be inevitablemasks for covid-19 management n95 masks figure 3a were the first form of ppe to be at risk of running out in hospitals because of their ability to filter out at least 95 of airborne non-oil aerosols and smaller particle aerosols these masks made by the 3m company were approved by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and when worn properly are face-fitting to reduce the wearers chance of inadvertently inhaling virus particles naturally good samaritan health centers communities and businesses responded to this ppe deficit these innovators attempted to slow the spread of covid-19 by modifying the original surgical mask design to mass-producing face shields around the world to develop environmental precautions for safe social distancing to ensue for example because surgical masks figure 3b are not face-fitting health professionals employed different tying strategies to secure the side openings figure 3c moreover wadhwani et al created a method of improving surgical masks when an n95 respirator is unavailable 56 dr wadhwani attached air-conditioning filters with a filter performance rating fpr of 10 to the outer surface of regular surgical masks to increase the filtering ability of the mask figure 3d the mask design filters out 95 of airborne particles larger than 03 microns similar to n95 respirators the mask was able to pass saccharin and smoke testing but has yet to be tested with other fda-approved regulationsself-manufacturing masks the three-dimensional 3d printing community has responded quickly and effectively a community with over 2 million consumers of 3d printers and 140000 industrial 3d printers around the world had the unique ability to change their item of production in hours instead of weeks and months effectively creating elastic production capacity for any device that can be 3d-printed bioengineers at the stanford prakash laboratory are currently developing the pneumask a modified full-face snorkel mask that can be reused by health professionals for ppe 57 the pneumask features one inhaling port at the top of the mask a breathing circuit filter that filters air entering through the inhaling port and two exhaling ports at the bottom of the face figure 3e the eyes nose and mouth are sealed from outside contact in this full-face snorkel the 3d-printed design can be disassembled and autoclaved for reuse this product has not been certified as ppe yet at dukes innovation co-lab bioengineers have created a powered air-purifying respirator papr design 58 to modify current surgical helmets figure 3f upper surgical helmets do not filter the air in the room so the laboratory used 3d printing to create a filter that could be attached to the suits figure 3f lower papr was tested by the precision air technology for hepa certification and is currently used by duke health this product has also not been certified as ppe yet in addition to the face masks designed by the prakash laboratory and the dukes innovation co-lab there are fully 3d printable designs from the veterans health administration and a maker mask group in seattle each mask design relies on filter patches to be inserted into the mask the maker mask is only meant for non-clinical settings where there are no fda-approved masks available figure 3g however the stopgap mask from the veterans health administration was approved by the fda to protect clinical personnel from covid-19 figure 3h this approval was allowed as the mask had effective disposable filters tightly fit around the nose and mouth and was easy to disinfecthigh-efficiency particulate air hepa-based air-conditioning filters are also a cause for concern hepa filters are effective in filtering particles larger than 03 microns that cannot pass through the filter as well as smaller particles that bounce off other particles and cling to the filter 59 hepa filters would seem to be an adequate solution when an n95 respirator is unavailable yet the dangers of using hepa filters for face masks is that glass fibers in masks could be inhaled and cause throat and facial irritation unless the air is filtered properlywith regard to homemade masks which the public has utilized for personal protection hospitals are far less likely to utilize them in a hospital setting for any purpose other than for use by patients this is due to their being constructed by a less effective material for blocking pathogens and to them being made in non-medical-grade conditions that could cause contamination of the masks with microorganisms medical-quality masks are three times more effective in blocking the transmission of microorganisms than homemade masks and are thus not suitable for use by medical professionals in the care of sick patientsthe new ppe and medical device designs that have emerged from the pandemic have not been through the extensive prototype testing that fda-approved devices have been able to pass it has not been confirmed as to whether the new devices effectively treat or harm users the cdc has issued an official statement that recommends healthcare professionals to only use homemade masks eg bandanas scarves for the care of patients with covid-19 as a last resort and focuses on maximizing current stores of ppe 60most regulations regarding the donation of ppe stem from the good samaritan drug and medical supply donation act 61 this law puts into place the basis for donating medical supplies to hospitals and medical professionals those who donate medical supplies must be able to describe the conditions under which the equipment was made so as to ensure medical-grade quality importantly as long as the donator makes sure the medical group is aware of these conditions and does not withhold any information about them the medical group and any patient may not be able to sue the donator for any injury or loss of life sustained while the donated equipment is being usedhowever using ppe that fails to comply with the fda niosh and occupational safety and health administration osha-approved tools poses a threat to the health of healthcare and essential workers to best filter aerosols and droplets the fda requires masks to pass the astm f 1862 fluid resistance test the astm f 1215-89 particle challenge study astm f2101-01 bacterial filtration efficiency bfe mil- m369454c breathability and cpsc cs-191-53 flammability 62 the fda cautions about the dangers of using 3d-printed ppe and specifically 3d-printed masks and respirators because while the ppe may provide a physical barrier it might not be able to safely provide fluid resistance bacterial filtration and breathability moreover 3d-printed ppe may not be face-fitting or function as properly as those manufactured by a medical company open-source 3d models from the same stl file in theory produce the same device but in reality these 3d files can result in an unexpected variation in the product due to differences in g-code variables when translated across different devices likewise different 3d printers have different thermoplastic filaments that vary in composition and properties 3d-printed ppe can pose a possible threat if the filament is prone to retaining moisture in the environment which can inadvertently transmit virus particles 63the role of face shields covering the entire face is another highly sought-after ppe for healthcare professionals 64 although face shields are not a fool-proof method of protection against viral particles a short-term barrier is sustained against the exposure of respiratory droplets by 97 after five minutes and 81 after thirty minutes 65 within a week of covid-19 being classified as a pandemic one of the biggest leaders in the 3d printing community prusa printers put out a face shield model that was verified by the ministry of health in the czech republic for use in clinical settings figure 3i 66 prusa printers alone printed and assembled 55000 face shields in three weeks 67 this initial effort was the beginning of a wave of 3d printers that started printing face shields for their medical workers in the community with over 250000 downloadsresearchers at the georgia institute of technology georgia tech and emory university worked together to design a diy shield frame that can be mass-produced using injection molding figure 3j the georgia tech team produced up to 2000 rigid frames per day 3000 rigid shields per day and 3000 disposable shields per day for hospitals all around atlanta 68 the designs were made available to others for worldwide manufacturing additionally the project manus team at the massachusetts institute of technology developed a single-sheet disposable face-shield design that can be mass-produced using die-cutting figure 3k 69 the project manus team produced 50000 shields per day to be shipped out to hospitals where healthcare professionals can easily store and assemble the disposable face shields teams at the university of cambridge and the university of queensland have also designed happyshield which is a curved-crease origami face-shield for infection control 70 happyshield can be easily assembled on-site and decontaminated for reuse over high numbers of shifts these products from different teams have not yet been certified as a ppethe good samaritans have taken yet another approach to provide solutions for the worlds hospitals in their time of need volunteers put together their sewing efforts to donate diy cloth face masks to hospitals healthcare facilities and nursing homes the cdc has released an official guideline on how when and where cloth face masks should be used as well as the instructions for the public on how to make cloth face masks specifically the cdc recommends the public to use tightly woven cotton for their homemade masks to slow the spread of the virus in public placesworkplace shields for prevention another population besides healthcare professionals at risk of contracting covid-19 and spreading the virus is essential workers financial institutions retail stores supermarkets manufacturing plants and funeral homes are all essential businesses under stress due to constant social interaction proximity to others and extended exposure from the high number of shifts safetell a physical security solution provider has designed the hygiene shield which allows staff to continue communicating safely to minimize physical contact figure 3l the clear glass wall can be easily disinfected and protects both consumers and employees from spreading the virus hygiene shields can be used for essential businesses that require the transaction of items from consumer to employee and vice versaumdasch a german company that creates special retail solutions has developed various devices to support retailers in the pandemic similar to safetells hygiene shields staff protection shields are acrylic glass shields that allow employees to communicate effectively while maintaining social distancing figure 3l 71aviointeriors an aircraft interior and passenger seat producer designed the glassafe and the janus seat to remodel aircraft seating arrangements in response to covid-19 7273 glassafe is a transparent glass covering that can be installed on existing seats to isolate the passenger on the sides and back of the seat figure 3l while the janus seats material is similar to that of glassafe the glassafe configuration allows passengers in the center to face backward instead of all passengers facing the flight direction this solution isolates all three passengers from each other and at the same time the rows in front and behind them and people who walk through the aisle are socially distancedthe hygiene station has a sensor-based disinfectant dispenser for contactless hand disinfectant a disinfectant wipe dispenser for sanitizing baskets and trolleys and an optional face mask dispenser the hygiene station also has a customer enumeration strategy for access management by controlling numbers of customers in the store at a time to enhance social distancing measures figure 3mgloves have long been used as a means to ensure the safety and wellbeing of healthcare workers who are at risk of being exposed to deadly pathogens however with the advent of the novel coronavirus many have wondered whether or not the usage of gloves in both medical and non-medical grades can help prevent the spread of the virus for medical purposes the cdc recommends that all personnel directly involved in the care of patients with covid-19 wear medical-grade gloves at all times and frequently change them to prevent the accidental spreading of the virus figure 4a without proper protocol gloves in a medical setting can carry microorganisms and will lead to increased rates of infection among both patients and medical professionalsfor non-medical settings the cdc does not recommend the usage of gloves for containing the spread of covid-19 unless caring for an infected family member where there is a risk of being exposed to bodily fluids while the gloves themselves have been proven to be effective many individuals without medical training are far less likely to frequently replace them and thus risk contaminating others with dirty gloves instead the cdc recommends frequent use of hand sanitizer containing 60 or more alcohol or frequent handwashing with soap and water for at least 30 s to ensure any microorganisms are cleaned off 74for medical professionals using gloves as a ppe only certain materials are approved by the fda for use as medical-standard materials for use in glove production figure 4a for routine inspections that are not expected to bring a medical professional into contact with bodily fluids latex and vinyl gloves are acceptable as a means for protection however for surgical settings or for situations where high exposure to covid-19 is anticipated thicker nitrile gloves are recommended and are considered to be the best option as a form of ppe 75mechanical ventilators mv are mechanical breathing assistance devices that use mechanical pressure to pump air into and out of the lungs these devices are used when patients are not able to breathe independently during the covid-19 surge the need for mv is exceeding capacity and mechanical engineering teams from the public and private sector have started to rapidly manufacture new devicesthe general design for mv includes an adjustable air pump a breathing monitor and an exhalation valve air administration may use either a face mask that covers the mouth or an intubation tube that flows air directly into the lungs figure 4b1 pressure sensors and air volume sensors monitor breathing and time the air-pump cycle and breath volume how long a patient uses the vent and weaning a patient off is determined by careful tests conducted by physicians 76as the demand for low-cost compact and sanitary ventilators are rising teams of engineers from universities and the private sector are making new designs figure 4b2 a stanford team developed a 150000 device which was donated to hospitals in peru 77 mit developed a prototype based on a design from a mechanical engineering class in 2010 78 the team partnered with the new york city economic development corporation to supply 3000 devices to the new york city hospitals 79 a georgia tech team led by dr shannon yee partnered with the emory healthcare system to design a prototype 80 their design is an adaptation of bag-valve-mask resuscitators with manual tidal volume adjustment and dual patient usage a team of both nasa and california institute of technology engineers developed a device named the ventilator intervention technology administered locally vital 81 their device is capable of handling outdoor terrains and has a device sterilization procedure to sterilize between patients the device was developed in only 37 days the low-cost devices are termed bridge ventilators or automatic resuscitators that are meant to be used before a critically ill patient is put on a standard ventilator figure 4b3 fda approval processes of the nasas vital ventilator and the mits bridge ventilator were both expedited by the fdas euathe fda employed the eua as of 24 march 2020 for ventilators to fast-track new approvals for designs that are not currently legally manufactured figure 4b4 the act states the fda will aid in the development and distribution of the newly approved devices approval reduces the number of requirements for the device the act only approves the ventilators for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic while the eua is in effect the fdas aid and the global need for ventilators have decreased the cost of manufacturing ventilators and increased the number of new designs medtronic already had a compact lightweight and portable ventilator that is termed the puritan bennett 560 the company plans on introducing the device in the usa under the eua and to ramp up production to 25000 units by the end of the summer medtronic the mit team and nasa are all licensing their blueprints for free or at a reduced cost to other manufacturersthe use of mechanical ventilators on high-risk patients over the age of 65 years is being put under scrutiny based on a new report of 5700 patients hospitalized with covid-19 of the patients between 1865 years old 764 died on mechanical ventilation and 198 of patients died who were not on mechanical ventilation of the patients older than 65 years 972 died on mechanical ventilation and 266 died who were not on mechanical ventilation 82 the discrepancy between patients who die on and off mechanical ventilation warrants further examination into the risk factors associated with using mechanical ventilation in different patient age-groups disease stages and disease severitiesmachine learning ml advances can be helpful in many aspects of the covid-19 pandemic such as molecular clinical and societal utilizationprotein structure prediction for covid-19 drug design from a molecular perspective ml models can be used to better understand the proteins that are involved in sars-cov-2 infection to help the search for potential targets for treatment first an alphafold 83 model was used to predict the protein 3d structure that was determined by amino acid sequences and their influence on the role and function of the protein of interest 84 figure 5a biomedical data reconstructs the relationships between proteins and drugs that can predict potentially effective drug candidates 85 therefore at a molecular scale ml has the potential to predict the structure of the protein identify existing drugs for targeting these proteins and enable covid-19 treatmentslarge-scale analysis of covid-19 ct scans from a clinical perspective ml can be used to detect covid-19 and predict patient outcomes pathogenic laboratory testing is the standard for screening suspected cases but this process is time-consuming with significant false-negative results therefore alternative diagnostic methods that are both accurate and rapid to combat the disease using machine learning to support diagnosis from ct scans are needed this is because of the virus exhibiting radiological signs and image patterns that can be observed in ct scans but identifying these signs remain difficult and time-consuming even for radiologists therefore because of the complexity of the imaging data researchers developed a deep-learning-based model for automatic screening and diagnosis of covid-19 detection based on ct chest scans 86 the inputs are pre-processed ct pictures from which the model first extracts a region of interest roi before passing it on to a convolutional neural network that classifies each roi using ensemble methods three-dimensional ct volumes can be used to detect covid-19 and its transmission patterns 87 a deep-learning-based algorithm takes a lung-region 3d ct scan and segments it using a pre-trained u-net neural network then the segmented region is fed into a 3d deep neural network and predicts the infection rate taking 3d space information for a weakly-supervised deep-learning model improved the prediction for infection figure 5bpandemic predictions for hospitalizations to prepare plan and optimize the health system during the pandemic forecasting patient outcomes is critical factors that make patients at risk for hospitalization should be identified to calculate the probability of developing acute respiratory distress and organ failure during clinic treatments based on the dataset that includes blood samples and ct scans from patients machine learning models can identify patients at high risk and who might develop respiratory distress in the future using models such as gradient boosting or the support vector machine key measurable and explainable features that influence those risks can be determined figure 5cspatial-temporal dynamics of pandemics from a societal perspective ml can be used to predict the number of cases under various quarantine policies and cluster geographical regions to find similarities understanding how the virus is transmitted and its effect on different demographics and geographic regions is crucial for public policy healthcare interventions the effect of quarantine control in the covid-19 spread can be accurately predicted using deep learning figure 5d a data-driven deep-learning model was developed to interpret and extrapolate publicly available data that was computed with the first-principles epidemiological equations 88 then isolation measures in different countries and their effects on controlling the reproduction number of the virus were compared by using this model the spread of the virus to implement reasonable quarantine rules could be predicted an autoencoder was created for real-time forecasting of new cases using the latent variable layers to extract the most important features for each geographical region the autoencoder was fed into a k-means clustering algorithm to group similar regions for further analysis 89covid-19 literature management finally other machine learning tools developed can indirectly help researchers and the public fight the pandemic covidscholar is a text-mining website aimed at synthesizing a huge amount of scientific literature on covid-19 using neuro-linguistic programming nlp to automate search this is helpful because more than 200 new journal articles are being published every day on the coronavirus a simple search for a rapid test in covidscholar provided organized and classified data that can greatly expedite covid-19 research figure 5ecovid-19 data collection since the outbreak of covid-19 who and most countries around the world have been trying to overcome the disease over the past few months by extensive testing and simulations that predict the degree to which the world would be affected this is achieved by the data collected by healthcare and government institutions around the world the simulation models have multiple sources of data that come from the who national health commission of the peoples republic of china nhc the covid tracking project european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc and cdc notable websites on pandemic data include 1point3acres worldometersinfo and bno news covid-19 is prone to community transmission and is therefore harder to track and to control its spread epidemic curves are often plotted in an attempt to understand the extent of infections and the implications of preventative measures the cdc suggested that adhering to strict preventative measures would make it possible to flatten the epidemic curve which is illustrated by a cartoon rendition figure 6a the simulation models are implemented by taking the current level of threat that is posed to society into consideration as well as the adverseness of the measures that need to be taken the results of the models are usually analyzed by governing institutions while implementing appropriate measures such that it minimizes economic and financial distress as depicted in the flowchart figure 6b to get accurate results from the simulation models researchers need the appropriate information and resources to make their models work figure 6chospital resource predictions the institute for disease modeling produced software called epidemiological modeling emod 90 which is used extensively by epidemiologists and research groups to understand the effects of taking measures to eradicate the disease or at least slow it down utilizing mathematical basis and concepts factors such as susceptibility to disease cases which tested positive for covid-19 and cases that recovered from covid-19 are included there are also assumptions made regarding the probability of a person catching covid-19 in a population which is further divided into groups to understand the propagation of the disease the depletion of healthcare resources such as the number of beds available in the us can be circumvented by taking appropriate social distance measures simulation models predict the availability of the number of icu beds regular hospital beds and equipment that are required such as ventilators figure 6dsocial pattern analysis several of the other common models deal with scenarios of the entirety of the population at the outset single group model such as social hierarchy division of the existing population into subpopulations composite group model characteristics and traits of individuals individual models and so on for covid-19 models a model that capitalizes on individual traits and behaviors can be accurately simulated to construct the model a set number of rubrics about the behavior of individuals are considered for example the set of actions and time of execution of actions for each individual would be rigid given the prior movements of the individual it should be possible to fully predict the individuals whereabouts of course except in cases such as the diamond princess this would hardly be an accurate assumption as it does not reflect the reality of the situation if the models need to consider extensive individualistic behavior to make them as accurate as possible there is a need to acquire a huge amount of data the active number of cases is predicted to decrease steadily until mid-june figure 6e the diamond princess ship is an interesting case study as it was in controlled settings and optimal for parameter control this case study helps in the analysis of how prevention of the covid-19 infection could have been brought about by implementing control measures based on the environment that exists on the diamond princess cruise ship a disease transmission model based on crowd flow control would be feasible for simulation purposesthere are several simplified online simulators available to the general public to experiment with and gain an understanding of the importance of social distancing to minimize the damage caused the washington post also simulated a covid-19 model based on a billiard ball model that conceptualizes many spherical structures that locomote within a bounded rectangular region of which a rendition is displayed figure 6f 91 this model is simplistic and is mainly used to spread awareness of the disease agent-based models can be used for the analysis of bias-variance trade-offs probabilistic graphical models differential equations and game theory 92 apart from simulations multiple websites such as the covid-19 visualizer used to update people on the number of cases worldwide in real-time were developed figure 6g the cdc website helps visualize multiple statistics and graphs for the pandemics dynamics figure 6h a website interface that is hosted by johns hopkins university provides various visualizations of the spread of covid-19 figure 6i more complex models include interactive python scripts to quantify the degree of social distancing geographic areas and ease of movement such as a covid-19 epidemic simulator figure 6jcomputational resources for covid-19 simulations another set of simulations in the fight against covid-19 involves running calculations in epidemiology bioinformatics and molecular modeling to study the virus spread and its dynamics high-performance computing and distributed computing are a few approaches that have been demonstrated to run experiments that would take months or years to complete on a traditional computing platform at a faster pace the covid-19 high-performance computing hpc consortium combines the computing capabilities of advanced and powerful computers to allow researchers to run projects related to the disease which require high computing power 93 this consortium includes a range of computers from small clusters to supercomputers from the us department of energy national laboratories companies like ibm google cloud and amazon web services federal agencies such as nasa and national science foundation nsf and various academic institutions such as the massachusetts institute of technology and the university of texas at austin currently there are 36 active projects on topics such as social modeling and forecasting based on epidemiology models understanding the structure of the virus at the molecular level analyzing the viral rna studying the dna of the patients infected and suchlike as an example of the potential of this approach using the worlds most powerful supercomputer summit built by ibm researchers were able to simulate more than 8000 small-molecule medications and natural product compounds within days and identified 77 compounds that had the potential to bind to the virus spike protein 94 another project that uses hpc is covid moonshot by postera a start-up company linked to cambridge university this project is a crowdsourcing initiative that accepts submissions of designs of potential drugs from chemists and uses machine learning to screen them and select the most promising candidates for synthesis and testing 95foldinghome is a distributed computing project based at washington university in the st louis school of medicine 96 it focuses on disease research connecting the unused processing power of laptops and desktop computers around the world to create a virtual supercomputer this project aims to understand how the spike protein in sars-cov-2 works and how therapeutics can be designed to stop it from infecting host cells using computer simulations to understand the proteins folding process considering the structures obtained from experiments as the starting point these simulations yield the structures that are otherwise hidden and identify potential sites to act as drug targets such a simulation has shown to be useful in the case of the ebola virus uncovering a previously unknown structure of the viral protein with a druggable site 97 rosettahome is another such distributed computing project run by the baker laboratory at the university of washington to predict the three-dimensional shapes of the viral proteins in their final folded state 98 unlike foldinghome which models the nature of protein folding rosetta studies only the final protein structure these projects can help access the structure and function of the proteins in the fight against the virussocial contract tracing in the past few months many countries have gone under lockdown to slow down the transmission of the virus however since lockdown disrupts productivity and affects the livelihood of the people an approach called contact tracing has been implemented in many places to contain the disease while allowing people to live a new normal 99 contact tracing is a way of identifying potentially infected people by studying peoples social interactions 100 it helps to notify healthcare workers of potential cases and the people of their risk of infection the government can use this information to recognize infection hotspots and come up with strategies this process is an important step that has been used in the past to slow down epidemics such as ebola and hiv while manual contact tracing is tedious and unreliable an automated digital approach using smartphone apps device tracking data and surveys may be a better solution 101 a general approach to smartphone app-based contact tracing is illustrated in figure 7a apart from apps a global positioning system gps and quick response code qr-code-based wristbands and bracelets are also used for tracking and enforcing quarantine so that authorities are alerted if a patient leaves their designated areasmartphone-based covid monitoring there are many smartphone applications developed and deployed around the world with a few of them being supported by the official government in countries like china singapore and india different approaches have been taken by different countries for example many countries require citizens to enter their personal information and allow location tracking while others use law enforcement monitoring authorities to automatically track the movement of citizens most covid-19 contact tracing applications use bluetooth to locate phones nearby that use the same application figure 7b the apps then keep a record of the bluetooth signals individuals encounter in distinct locations these bluetooth signals can contain information about the distance between people and the number of times where individuals were close to each other when a person tests positive the result is uploaded to the app which then notifies other people who may have been exposed to the virus based on how close individuals were to the personapart from contact tracing and alerting several of these apps also help in tracking symptoms self-diagnosis and providing healthcare information to the users 102103104105106 apps like the covid symptom study 107 and howwefeel 108 by the th chan school of public health and web-based surveys like the covid-19 screening tool by apple and cdc covid-19 symptoms and social distancing web survey and global covid-19 survey by harvard th chan school of public health have daily surveys that help in collecting data about the prevalence of covid-19 symptoms in a location-based anonymous manner figure 7c 109 these surveys collect details such as demographic background zip code health conditions daily symptoms possible exposure to others with covid-19 and social distancing behavior this data can help health agencies to predict virus hotspots and respond better to the pandemicone of the key concerns regarding using a smartphone app for contact tracing is the issue of privacy 110 individuals are reluctant to share their private information with other individuals public health professionals the government or cell service providers this issue has been considered and there are a few privacy-sensitive apps such as tracetogether 111 an app used in singapore and covidsafe 112 an app developed by the university of washington and microsoft which uses bluetooth communications between devices to track contact figure 7d similar efforts have been led by researchers at mit who came up with a smartphone-assisted contact tracing system called private automated contact tracing pact 113 which identifies people who are at risk of covid-19 infection in an anonymous and location-independent manner by using bluetooth communication between cell phones in proximity while the technology has been tested at the laboratory large-scale use has yet to be implemented a major initiative in this area is the google and apple contact tracing project which combines bluetooth low energy technology with privacy-preserving cryptography to create an exposure notification system being a collaborative effort between google and apple the exposure notification application programming interface api works across both android and ios devices using the api app developers working on behalf of public health authorities can build applications for smartphones according to their specifications in the future there will be an integration of this system with googles android and apples ios operating systems to rely less on appsonline search method for covid-19 tracking another method of digitally monitoring the spread of the disease involves studying online search behavior 114 a study by researchers from university college london in collaboration with public health england microsoft research and harvard medical school uses machine learning to track covid-19 by using keywords from google search queries and covid-19-related news coverage daily google search data is collected from the google health trends api it includes queries about covid-19-related symptoms as identified by the nhs ff100 survey and other coronavirus-related terms their current model uses online search frequency time-series to predict the prevalence of covid-19 in a few countries including the united kingdom the united states of america usa australia canada and italy this research can help identify potential positive cases who are otherwise not tested and help understand the true extent of community spreadas of now vaccines are under development to prevent covid-19 in healthy individuals a vaccine has an integral role in protecting society and removing current social distancing protocols currently multiple pharmaceutical companies and university labs are working on the creation of the vaccine in collaboration or independently these partnerships are utilizing existing vaccine technologies that include inactivated viruses virus-like particles protein nanoparticles in matrix-m non-replicating or replicating viral vectors rna- or dna-based vaccines and protein subunits along with researching the platform for the vaccines different routes of administration are useful in the development of these vaccines with the four phases of clinical trials necessary for fda approval covid-19 vaccines are projected to be available to the public in 1218 months 115 tracked by the regulatory focus professionals society a few of the most promising vaccines under clinical trials are an mrna vaccine and a non-replicating viral vector vaccine 116the university of oxford is using a non-replicating viral vector from chimpanzees adenovirus to target the s glycoprotein which is under a phase i clinical trial 117 the vaccine contains the weakened version of the adenovirus with the genetic material of the sars-cov-2 spike protein this spike protein acts as a protection for the immune system if covid-19 infects the body the university of oxford and astrazeneca have also paired together for the global development of this vaccine following the clinical trials 118 current estimates dictate that if human trials are successful then this vaccine may be publicly available by september 119 vaccine development is typically a long and expensive process with high attrition and stringent involvement of the fda however in the case of a pandemic many steps such as clinical development and manufacturing development are done parallelly to speed up the development process previous tried-and-true methods must be utilized in vaccine development to allow for sufficient manufacturing 120to further aid in terminating this pandemic a global testing strategy is needed such that a significant portion of the population gets screened for the disease doing so ensures that we have a better understanding of the disease progression and can further help in allocating medical staff and resources in different hospitals cities and countries currently there are more than 20 different test kits for covid-19 each with a different rate of producing false positives andor false negatives 121 furthermore countries have varying guidelines for reporting infected cases these factors increase the variability in the reported data and are uninformative about the disease progression which negatively affects several nations ability to adequately prepare for this pandemic as it develops quickly worldwide therefore countries need to have detailed testing guidelines and report their testing results regularly and openlymolecular testing checks for the presence of sars-cov-2 genetic material from respiratory specimens either through swapping nostrils or sampling saliva in addition to this covid-19 diagnostics involves serological testing for the presence of antibodies against sars-cov-2 and it can be done through a blood sample from a simple finger prick although serological tests are typically faster than molecular testing a higher rate of producing false negatives is obtained because the human body starts producing antibodies against the virus a few days to a week after the infection what further increases the complexity of the problem is the fact that the fda has approved over 40 serological tests from different manufacturers each with different precision and accuracy measures 122several countries are considering giving an immunity passport via antibody test results in place of a vaccination certificate to identify which individuals are ready to go back into society an immunity passport would allow individuals to return to their workplaces and schools as well as other aspects of daily activities it could act as the first step in society returning to its status quo there is a gap in understanding the time frame for which igg antibodies last as well as the number of antibodies needed to prevent infection which would be critical to assigning citizens the immunity passport antibody tests still need to have acceptable specificities and sensitivities as well as optimize false negatives and positives if an individual is false-positive and gets an immunity passport then the individual could unknowingly infect others these passports cannot be given based on self-reporting of covid-19 either just because a couple of individuals did not get tested with these current gaps in knowledge the antibody test field needs to be researched further before an immunity passport becomes an adopted policyanother topic to consider is which careers and places would need this immunity passport places of large public gatherings such as restaurants clubs and public transportation systems would have to check for it healthcare professionals restaurant staff and other jobs involving human contact would require this immunity passport an issue that arises with the assignment of an immunity passport is that it excludes several workers and is liable to corruption as well as social inequities particular people would have better access to these antibody tests and be able to prioritize their applications ahead of others additionally many legal issues ensue in terms of whether the lack of immunity counts as disability and anti-discrimination laws vaccine certificates incentivize people to get vaccines a beneficial act for the individual and society on the other hand these immunity passports seem to incentivize covid-19 infection which is detrimental to society countries that suggest using immunity passports should consider the societal consequences of this decision 123a robust healthcare workforce is essential in responding to this pandemic while unemployment is quickly rising in other industries with many businesses shutting down more healthcare workers are still needed to deal with the sudden influx of patients many primary care doctors are working remotely via telemedicine and can address any patients concerns without risking the patients exposure to covid-19 previously many physicians and patients resisted this concept of virtual healthcare since in-person consultations are vital to both parties however this virtual healthcare system allows physicians to see up to 100 patients per day and allows patients to avoid the long waiting-room time 124not all patients can be evaluated by telemedicine with the rise of covid-19 cases there is a need for healthcare professionals in hospitals and clinics to provide services in environments with high viral exposure coupled with a lack of ppe most countries have a shortage of medical equipment such as ventilators as well as ppe like face masks sanitizers and gloves this shortage can be attributed to a lack of planning from the healthcare sector in the case of a pandemic 124 however many private companies are now supporting the government to expiate this even though the private healthcare sector is fully prepared for every eventuality unlike other sectors the sector is facing two major challengesthe industry is also likely to benefit from increased awareness about healthcare there should be increased recruitment of medical professionals and front-line health workers should be prioritized in receiving vaccines and diagnostic tests as well as the families of these workers due to the high risk of transmission start-ups that aim to develop health-related products will receive more attention from investors creating a series of biotechnology ventures that are inspired by the covid-19 experienceas people have grown to realize the importance of healthcare more students are drawn to health-related education in such a critical time one of the only industries that have shown no signs of slowing down is the healthcare sector making proper healthcare the only way to make it to the other side of this pandemic with this field having the greatest demand in such a situation many students will be attracted to healthcare fieldsto expedite the much-needed process of clinical trials for covid-19 treatments as mentioned previously national institute of health nih has collaborated with 16 companies including abbvie amgen astrazeneca bristol myers squibb evotec glaxosmithkline johnson  johnson ksq therapeutics eli lilly merck novartis pfizer roche sanofi takeda and vir biotechnology while big pharmaceutical companies usually work independently these industries are now collaborating with different companies and laboratories in the fight against covid-19 such nih industry partnership allows for standardized testing protocols and gives researchers access to better facilities for diagnoses treatment and vaccine testing 125 these industrial partners have promising potential results of their respective research in the fields of diagnostics prevention and treatment as highlighted in table 1in this paper the biological background of coronaviruses was provided with a specific focus on the newly emerging virus sar-cov-2 and the ongoing pandemic covid-19 the diseases symptoms methods of transmission and the currently available medical supportive care were discussed the control measures for a pandemic were highlighted to incorporate herd immunity shield immunity drug repurposing and vaccine development the various tools of protection were demonstrated along with their proper use a unique perspective was provided to utilize diy fabrication methods to make face masks face shields and ventilators that provide adequate cost-effective protection against the disease a multidisciplinary approach was presented to integrate machine learning applications statistical simulations and digital monitoring in combating covid-19 tracking its spread and predicting its trajectory the role of public regulations in controlling the disease infection rate was shown with specific emphasis on standardizing the criteria to report new covid-19 patients developing novel vaccines and running nation-wide immunity tests finally this review emphasized the need for preparedness for the management of the covid-19 pandemic and beyondcoronavirus 2019 is caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 because its genetic sequence is approximately 80 similar to the virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which is now called sars-cov-1 this virus was first recognized in china in december of 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world the most common manifestations include fever cough myalgia extreme fatigue and shortness of breath with less commonly reported symptoms including sore throat headache anosmia dysgeusia diarrhea and nausea data from china suggest that 81 of patients with confirmed cases have illness that is mild not requiring hospitalization 14 have severe illness generally characterized by pneumonia and typically requiring hospitalization and 5 have critical illness often requiring care in an intensive care unit persons at highest risk are those older than 65 years of age and those with underlying health conditions eg cardiovascular conditions diabetes hypertension chronic respiratory disease12 although estimates of case fatality rates have varied widely a recent study using individual case data from china estimated both the case fatality rate which is the proportion of clinically recognized cases that will eventually lead to death and the infection fatality rate which is the proportion of all infections that will eventually lead to death as 138 and 066 respectively3 the true case fatality rate and the infection fatality rate will not be known until serosurveys allow for a more precise measurement of those with undiagnosed infections and may vary from region to region based on availability of health care resources the covid-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly although there is a great deal we do not know we continue to learn more dailyas with other issues related to covid-19 much remains to be learned about sars-cov-2 transmission based on available data evidence supports that transmission is similar to that of influenza sars and middle east respiratory syndromeprimarily person-to-person through respiratory droplets that are produced when a person coughs sneezes or talks among close contacts large droplets typically do not travel more than 6 feet thus close contact is defined as less than 6 feet from a person with covid-19 infection droplets that land in the mouths noses or eyes or possibly are inhaled into the lungs of people in close contact can cause infection however under some circumstances droplets may travel more than 6 feet depending on various factors such as expiratory effort viscosity of the respiratory secretions and air currents in the area4 furthermore recent work has suggested that exhalations sneezes and coughs may create turbulent gas clouds that may be able to travel longer distances5 infection may also occur when a person touches a surface contaminated with the infectious secretions and respiratory droplets from a person with infection6 although sars-cov-2 has been detected in stool by polymerase chain reaction testing it remains unknown whether infectious virus may be shed in stool or whether stool may play a role in the transmission of sars-cov-27the contribution of infectious aerosols small respirable particles to the transmission of covid-19 is currently unknown some of this uncertainty about the role of airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 parallels the uncertainty regarding influenza transmission although airborne transmission of influenza can be demonstrated in experimental models and selected circumstances such as airplanes with disabled ventilation systems8 the contribution of airborne spread to influenza transmission is thought to be small furthermore the relevance of experimental models to viral transmission in clinical settings is unclear in an artificial experiment that generated sars-cov-2 aerosols in a laboratory setting without hospital-level ventilation systems virus remained viable in aerosols for as long as 3 hours9 however in an analysis of air samples near a patient with a high viral load of sars-cov-2 virus was not identified in eight air samples after a patient was instructed to breath normally breathe deeply speak and cough continuously these specimens were collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patients chin with or without wearing a surgical mask10 during certain medical procedures involving the respiratory tract such as noninvasive ventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation and endotracheal intubation respiratory aerosols can be generated1112 however other studies have questioned whether significant aerosols are generated from some of these procedures13although most covid-19 infections are related to exposure to persons with symptomatic disease two reports of viral shedding and likely transmission by presymptomatic period before developing overt covid-19 infection or asymptomatic persons raise concern that in areas with active covid-19 transmission all patients should be considered as potential sources one report describes seven clusters of transmission in singapore where transmission likely occurred before source patients became symptomatic this asymptomatic transmission accounted for 64 of known covid-19 transmission locally14 in another report from an outbreak in a skilled nursing facility in the united states about half of residents with detectable virus were asymptomatic or presymptomatic at the time of sampling viral levels measured by polymerase chain reaction cycle time were similar for those with and without symptoms15 although these findings may not be generalizable to the obstetric population they demonstrate the potential for unrecognized viral shedding in areas of high disease prevalence among 215 women admitted for delivery at two hospitals in new york city 29 of the 33 88 who tested positive for sars-cov-2 were asymptomatic at presentation sutton d fuchs k dalton m goffman d universal screening for sars-cov-2 in women admitted for delivery letter new engl j med 2020 apr 13 epub ahead of printalthough the use of personal protective equipment is a critical strategy to protect health care workers other strategies also need to be implemented case finding is one such strategy and a pillar to preventing exposure in health care settings before entering an ambulatory care setting pregnant patients need to be screened for possible symptoms of covid-19 or exposures to patients with known or suspected covid-19 this can be done by telephone when outpatient appointments are scheduled patients with symptoms or significant exposures should be assessed to determine whether an in-person appointment is necessary or whether the patient can be seen through telemedicine and managed at home16 if an outpatient appointment is necessary a facemask should be placed on any patient with respiratory symptoms immediately on presentation known as source control and she should be quickly isolated in an examination room with the door closed if the prevalence of covid-19 in the community is high placing a mask on all patients should be considered to minimize potential transmission from presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients with covid-19 infection who could be shedding virus triage areas should be separate well-ventilated areas and barriers should ensure that patients are separated eg plexiglass barriers from staff during the screening process patients in triage areas should sit at least 6 feet apart which commonly requires rearranging the seating ample hand hygiene dispensers should be placed in triage areas waiting rooms and patient care areas the number of personnel entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection should be minimized this may be accomplished by having physicians perform some aspects of patient care that may normally be performed by nursing staff eg vital signs some tasks such as visits with dieticians can be virtual hand hygiene is critically important for preventing nosocomial transmission of covid-19 particularly with the demonstration of persistence of virus on surfaces from several hours up to 3 days depending on the surface material10 furthermore frequent cleaning of surfaces and rooms should be undertaken with high-touch areas such as door knobs faucets and chair arms being wiped with an appropriate disinfectant between patientsuse of personal protective equipment is a fundamental strategy for protection of health care workers current recommendations from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc for care of persons with known or suspected covid-19 infection include an n95 respirator if available or facemask if a respirator is not available eye protection gown and gloves17 these recommendations are based on a systematic review that demonstrated that the odds ratio or of acquiring a respiratory virus infection is 032 95 ci 026039 if wearing a facemask 017 95 ci 007043 if wearing an n95 respirator 032 95 ci 023045 if wearing gloves and 033 95 ci 024045 if wearing a gown if all interventions are included the or of developing a respiratory viral infection is 009 95 ci 002035 the or of acquiring a respiratory viral infection with the use of eye protection is 010 95 ci 00501718an n95 respirator is a personal protective device that covers the nose and mouth fits tightly and reduces the wearers risk of inhaling airborne particles these respirators are designed to prevent the wearer from diseases known or suspected to be transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei including measles varicella and mycobacterium tuberculosis unlike respiratory viruses that are primarily spread by droplets these specific microorganisms can be widely dispersed by air currents and may be inhaled by a person in the same room or over a long distance from the patient depending on factors such as temperature and ventilation19 for settings in which airborne transmission is the primary transmission mechanism there are three respirator options an n95 respirator filters out at least 95 of airborne particles sized 03 micrometers in diameter although in practice up to 10 of n95 respirator users exposed to aerosolized influenza had breakthrough leakage20 another type of respirator is a powered air-purifying respirator which uses high-efficiency particulate air filters these respirators are reusable and must be cleaned and disinfected after each use filters should be replaced according the manufacturers recommendations the national institute for occupational safety and health has cautioned against use of powered air-purifying respirators in the operating room because of concerns that unfiltered exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field and the absence of scientific evidence to support use however a preliminary experimental study using two types of powered air-purifying respirators found no contamination of the surgical field although these findings are reassuring further study is needed21 cartridge air purifying respirators are another option depending on the filter cartridge chosen they can provide a similar level of respiratory protection to that provided by an n95 respirator and can be reused these respirators generally have not been designed for use in the health care settings communication with patients may be difficult during use and there are no manufacturer instructions for decontaminationa facemask is a standard fda-cleared medical mask that may or may not have a plastic face shield attached these are the standard masks used on labor and delivery units surgical masks prevent transmission of viruses transmitted by large droplets a common method for prevention of transmission of respiratory viral illnesses19 importantly whether a medical mask or respirator the operator must wear facial protection correctly and use eye protection to assure that all mucous membranes are coveredwhen caring for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection cdc guidance states that facemasks are an acceptable alternative to n95 masks when the supply of n95 masks is insufficient except when aerosol-generating procedures are performed17 although the cdc guidance implies that n95 masks are superior to facemasks there are some recent reassuring data about the effectiveness of facemasks in illnesses transmitted by respiratory dropletsprevious studies have provided mixed results and the majority of studies assessing respiratory protection against viruses have focused on influenza a noninferiority randomized trial of 446 nurses concluded that surgical masks compared with n95 masks resulted in noninferior rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza however this study was halted prematurely owing to the onset of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic and changes in the health systems recommended personal protective equipment use22 by contrast the authors of two other randomized trials2324 as well as a pooled analysis of the two studies25 concluded that n95 masks may be more effective than surgical masks although the n95 group had lower rates of clinical respiratory illness influenza-like illness laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection and laboratory-confirmed influenza compared with the surgical mask group these differences were not statistically significant in the intent-to-treat analysis25 a recent 4-year cluster randomized trial compared the effect of n95 respirators with that of facemasks among 2862 health care personnel the study found no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza for those wearing n95 respirators compared with those wearing face masks26 a recent cochrane systematic review found that n95 respirators were not significantly different than surgical masks in preventing respiratory virus acquisition but were more expensive uncomfortable and irritating to skin18 using polymerase chain reaction testing a recent case report found no transmission of sars-cov-2 to 41 health care workers who had more than 10 minutes of exposure at less than 2 m from a patient undergoing multiple aerosolizing procedures 85 of these health care workers wore surgical masks27 although this report is reassuring it is limited by being an isolated case reportthere has been a great deal of discussion and debate in obstetric circles about what does and does not constitute an aerosolizing procedure because the cdc guidance states that n95 masks are important when aerosol-generating procedures are performed17 it is important to be able to identify procedures on the labor and delivery unit that have a high likelihood of producing aerosols intubation for general anesthesia has been shown to produce aerosols and may increase the risk of transmission to the person performing the intubation by contrast cesarean deliveries under neuraxial anesthesia ie spinal or epidural are unlikely to produce aerosolsthere has been speculation that the labored breathing and expulsive efforts of pushing in the second stage of labor may generate aerosols although the risks of aerosolization during vaginal delivery have not been studied most aerosolizing procedures that have been identified as high risk eg intubation bronchoscopy involve direct manipulation of the respiratory tract1112 however of the role of turbulent gas clouds in covid-19 transmission is not known5 given the limitations of the current evidence it is not possible to definitely state whether or not aerosols are generated during the second stage of labor however given what we know to date it is highly likely that the primary method of transmission of covid-19 is through respiratory droplets all women with covid-19 infection should wear a facemask during their entire hospitalization including during the second stage of labor source control when possiblecurrently there are challenges with adequate supplies of personal protective equipment with some hospitals having shortages of certain types of personal protective equipment and some reporting overall shortages problems with the personal protective equipment supply chain in the united states have been described during previous public health emergencies for example during the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic the commercial supply could not keep up with the demand for n95 masks and facemasks to address shortages supplies from the us strategic national stockpile were released since that time the strategic national stockpile has not been replenished to the pre-h1n1 level and the personal protective equipment supply chain has not substantially improved28 resulting in shortages during the current covid-19 pandemic thus extended use and limited reuse have been recommended by the cdc as strategies to conserve personal protective equipment extended use refers to wearing the same n95 mask for repeated contact with several patients limited reuse involves using the same n95 mask for contact with several patients but removing doffing it between patient encounters29 for pathogens such as tuberculosis in which transmission from fomites is not a concern n95 mask reuse has been widely practiced with covid-19 the primary infection risk from reuse is self-inoculation if the surface of the n95 mask becomes contaminated in a study of 10 nurses during two 12-hour shifts nurses touched their faces or the n95 mask more than 20 times per 12-hour shift30 therefore if extended use or reuse of n95 masks is practiced it is critical that health care professionals practice correct donning and doffing practice good hand hygiene and avoid touching the n95 mask or their faces during use although it is unknown whether sars-cov-2 may contaminate the filtering material of respirators influenza virus was able to be recovered from n95 respirators experimentally exposed to aerosols containing influenza31given the possibility of exhausting the supply of n95 respirators during the covid-19 pandemic many health care organizations have resorted to reuse of n95 masks beyond the cdcs limited recommendation with continued use of respirators until they become soiled or lose integrity novel cleaning regimens including the use of uv light vaporized hydrogen peroxide or other methods have been suggested3235with current mask shortages members of the public have been offering to sew cloth masks a cluster-randomized trial of medical and cloth masks found a significantly higher rate of influenza-like illness among health care workers in the cloth mask arm compared with the medical mask arm36 in addition cloth masks have limited ability to protect the wearer against the penetration of fluids through the mask after a splash therefore hospital systems should be cautious about using cloth masks for direct patient care activity with patients under investigation for or with confirmed covid-19 infection cloth masks are likely effective in capturing large droplets and keeping the wearer from being a source of transmission owing to evidence that people with covid-19 infection who do not have symptoms can transmit the virus to others37 the cdc has recently recommended wearing cloth masks in public particularly in settings in which maintaining social distancing is difficult therefore cloth masks may be useful for decreasing community transmission38obstetricians on busy labor and delivery units want to know how to best protect themselves from covid-19 unfortunately during this current covid-19 pandemic there has been widespread concern and confusion about personal protective equipment particularly about types and use of masks although much of the focus is on facial protection data from the sars outbreak suggest that it is the bundle of personal protective equipment with hand hygiene and environmental cleaning that leads to decreased risk of transmission of respiratory viruses and this is likely true for covid-19the personal protective equipment guidance at the national level and at the hospital system level can be complex and confusing furthermore it can change rapidly based on evolving evidence as well as availability of supplies although adherence to infection-control procedures is important published and anecdotal evidence suggests that health care professionals including obstetricians have opportunities for improvement39 the key for obstetricians is to be familiar with whatever personal protective equipment is stocked by their labor and delivery unit to train using that personal protective equipment and to use personal protective equipment correctly and consistently including donning and doffing for places where the rapid increase of patients has not yet begun now is a good time for labor and delivery units to conduct refresher training for personal protective equipment use and to consider conducting multidisciplinary simulations of a pregnant patient with covid-19 infection presenting to labor and delivery strict adherence to hand hygiene combined with correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment and careful environmental cleaning may help reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission and help keep obstetricians healthy during this time of covid-19a novel coronavirus now designated sars cov 2 was first reported in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 1 the covid-19 pandemic has since reached an unprecedented magnitude with approximately 2 million cases and 150000 deaths worldwide at the time of writing iran is to date the most affected country by covid-19 in the middle east and north african region and is one of the countries where the virus spread quickly and early the iranian ministry of health and treatment reported that as of 15 april there had been 76389 confirmed cases of the infection and 4777 deaths in iran due to covid-19 also more than 100 iranian health workers have died from the coronavirus 2ensuring the safety of healthcare workers hcw is not only crucial in protecting them against the virus but also in preventing the transmission of the virus 3 understanding the behaviours of hcw including the wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment ppe is therefore important in covid-19 prevention in this regard the world health organization who has identified education as one of the most important components of prevention programs 4 experts also believe that one of the reasons for the failure of educational programs is the lack of attention to analytical studies and their inability to consider psycho-social models as an intellectual framework in educational planning among the theories that have been used in various studies to predict protective behaviours is the protective motivation theory pmt 5considering the importance of identifying the determinants of the preventive behaviours of covid-19 in hcw in the design and implementation of preventive programs this study was conducted for predicting the preventive behaviour of hcw towards covid-19 based on the pmtthe present cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted in five teaching hospitals of the hamadan city the capital of hamadan province affiliated to hamadan university of medical sciences in march 2020 the study population was 25 of hospital staff selected through multi-stage sampling sequence of stratified- simple random sampling to participate in the study all agreed to participate and complete the questionnaire the ethics committee of the hamadan university of medical sciences approved the studydata were collected using a self-reported questionnaire the questionnaire consisted of two sectionsdemographic characteristics and the pmt constructs the demographic and background factors included age gender education work experience and job the pmt constructs were assessed by 23 questions composed under six major constructs a perceived vulnerability b perceived severity c self-efficacy d response efficacy e response cost and f protection motivation the items were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree the construct perceived susceptibility was assessed by two items ie it is unlikely that i will be infected with the coronavirus the perceived severity was assessed by three items ie coronavirus disease can lead to death the perceived self-efficacy was assessed by five items ie i can use the mask constantly in my work environment the response efficacy was assessed by five items ie disinfecting surfaces and equipment prevent coronavirus the response cost was evaluated by two items ie i feel that protecting yourself against coronavirus is time-consuming and finally the protection motivation behavioural intention was assessed by one item ie i intend to observe the recommended precautions until the end of the coronavirus epidemic according to the theoretical assumptions the threat appraisal score is the sum of the perceived susceptibility and severity scores also the coping appraisal score is the sum of the self-efficacy and response efficacy scores minus the response cost scorecovid-19 preventive behaviours were measured by five items rated by a 3-point likert scale always sometimes and never scored 2 1 and 0 respectively the validity of the questionnaire was confirmed using the viewpoints of 10 health education experts the reliability of the questionnaire was investigated by calculating internal consistencycorrelation between bmt components was assessed by pearsons correlation coefficient the mean of threat and efficacy score were compared according to demographic characteristics using ttest and anova a univariate linear regression analysis was performed to screen potentially significant determinants of intention and behaviour all statistical analyses were conducted in stata version 14 with a significant level of less than 5a total of 761 hcw were enrolled with a mean age of 3538823 years range 22-60 364 4783 were male the mean duration of employment was 1032857 years 73 959 231

between intention and other constructs of pmt model including perceived susceptibility severity response efficacy self-efficacy and response cost p0001 table i
 the response cost 578 and intention 8425 had the lowest and highest percentage of the mean from the maximum obtainable score among structures of the modelprotective behaviours of hcw against covid-19 showed that wearing a glove for all procedures 433  and using a face mask at any time 518 were the least frequent preventive behaviours 79 and 37 of participants never used gloves or a mask during patient care respectively 87 and 846 always washed their hands frequently with water and soap and avoided mixing with others during the shift overall preventive behaviours against covid-19 among hcw with 731 of the mean from the maximum obtainable score were assessed at a relatively desirable levelaccording to the results scores of threat and coping appraisal were compared according to sub-groups of demographic variables females had a higher score of threat 2068299 vs 1989333 p0001 technicians had the lowest score of threat 1911355 and paramedics had a higher score 211129 p0001in table ii
 we modeled the predictors of the intention and behaviour based on the pmt model the threat and coping appraisal had a predicted increase of 034 and 0085 respectively in the mean of the intention score p0001 on the other each incensement in intention score was associated with a 072 increase in behavior score p0001in this study the protective behaviors against the covid-19 evaluated at a relatively favourable level by contrast protective behaviours against workplace illnesses and injuries among health care staff and students such as nurses and physicians were unfavourable in other studies 6 7 discrepancies in the findings of different studies may be related to factors such as awareness the perceived threat of illnesses and training provided in the workplace the hospital environment is a closed work environment in which the staff members are often exposed to stress and pressure also in this setting they have direct contact with patients infected with coronavirus hence educational interventions to protect hcw from diseases such as coronavirus are essentialin the present study continuous use of masks and wearing of gloves for all procedures was less frequent by hcw despite these being key protective measures according to the who 4 the probability of physicians and nurses having contact with contaminated surfaces while taking care of respiratory patients in a non-outbreak setting was reported as 90 whereas the rate of mask use by hcw in the same study was 29 8 by contrast rajoura et al reported that 826 of physicians and 85 of indian nurses used masks in their workplace at the time of the epidemic h1n1 influenza 9 the lower levels of ppe declared in our study may be attributable to low levels of awareness no habit of mask and glove wearing perception that they interfere with performing tasks lack of time and lack of understanding of the importance of observing health and safety principlesas the most important hypothesis of the pmt as well as the most important hypothesis of the present study the results showed that both threat appraisal and coping appraisal predicted behavioural intention in other words according to the hypothesis of the pmt that suggests two decisions process to engage or not engage in health-related behaviours the threat appraisal components have a higher ability to predict the behavioural intention huang et al showed that emotion-focused and problem-focused responses were predicted coping strategies of nurses and nursing students at the time of covid-19 outbreaks which is consistent with the results of the present study 10this study showed that hcw were not at a desirable level of perceived efficiency rather their assessed perceived threat was relatively at a desirable level as a result 355 of participants were on the fear control path considering the assumptions of the pmt first the threat is assessed in terms of severity next by increasing the perceived threat a second evaluation is motivated on the effectiveness of the recommended strategies in this situation in addition to evaluating the effectiveness of recommended strategies the individuals also evaluate their level of effectiveness when the threat is not considered seriously low perceived susceptibility and severity there is a low motivation to focus on the subject making people superficially evaluate the effectiveness of recommended strategies in other words if people do not grasp the threat and do not understand its severity they will easily ignore the relevant available information in contrast similar to the findings of the present study despite the perceived threat when people find the recommended strategy ineffective with low self-efficacy or find themselves unable to act against the recommended strategy and to prevent a serious threat the fear control process will prevail over the danger control process 5 considering the findings of the present study increasing the perceived efficacy of protective behaviours against covid-19 by hcw is recommended as an educational priorityone of the limitations of this study is that evaluating behaviour by self-reporting can cause bias and misrepresentation furthermore the reluctance of some members of the research community to participate in the study was another limitation however the findings showed that protective behaviours against covid-19 were at relatively favourable levels among hcw hcw are expected to be at the highest level of threat and efficiency and experience the process of danger control therefore future training programmes must consider the level of self-efficacy of hcw and increase their knowledge regarding the effectiveness of recommendation strategies to perform protective measures against the covid-19this study supported from the

skin is the outermost barrier of human body hcws fighting against covid19 are prone to the damage of skin and mucosa barrier in order to minimize skin and mucosa barrier breakdown hcws should adhere to standards on wearing protective equipment and avoid overprotection at the same time measures of skin care are recommended during work this consensus provides professional advices on prevention and management of mild skin disorders nevertheless timely referral to dermatologists is necessary if dermatoses are sustained or worsened graduallyall authors have no conflict of interestthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic presents a significant challenge to the medical profession the widespread effect of this pandemic and its influence on the practice of orthopaedic surgery and musculoskeletal work is the subject of this work we discuss the issues revolving personal protection of musculoskeletal msk healthcare workers non-operative management of musculoskeletal conditions remote consultations trauma escalation stages staff wellbeing and orthopaedic surgery for covid-19 casesaerosol droplets from the patients mouth or nose spread from an infected patient to the health worker via a direct aerosol assault can vary in quantum from low level contamination  from encounters such as talking  to high level contamination  via coughing or sneezing such aerosol entry may be via the nose mouth or eyes of the recipient the distance of the source to the recipient influences the quantum a safe distance of 6 feet is recommended when possible to minimize such aerosol spread during clinical encounters1
sars-cov-2 is detectable in aerosols for up to three hours2 and hence aerated rooms are safer than closed spaces regular ventilation of closed spaces is advisablea wide variety of aerosol filters face masks are available and sometimes the nomenclature can be challenging to understand2 the two main variables one needs to consider when one decides to choose such a mask is the filter efficiency and whether it provides an airtight fit around the personnels mouth and nose filter efficiency is tested by assessing the proportion of a 300 nm 03 m aerosol challenge which is filtered by the device to understand the nomenclature mentioned in the following table for example a ffp2 filter will prevent at least 94 of the aerosol challenge from passing through the european ratings are covered with two standards and the filters are classified as filtering face piece ffp ffp1 ffp2 or ffp3 or p1p2p32  see table 1
the us healthcare lead by centre for disease control cdc uses a different nomenclature although the principle of testing is similar for example a n95 mask filters out 95 of particles sized 300 nm3 see table 2
the size of coronavirus is around 100 nm 01 m4 and hence simple mathematics would suggest that these particles would pass through most of these filters which are tested for a 300 nm particle challenge however particles smaller than 300 nm do not travel in a linear motion they travel using a zig-zag movement as they are bounced randomly by molecules of comprising air brownian motion2 hence these particles are often trapped in filters with mesh sizes bigger than themselves n95 masks are recommended for medium risk clinical encounters for high-risk encounters positive pressure suits are recommended2

many of the re-useable commercially available facemasks respirators for protection during spray paintingwoodworkindustrial fumes are ffp3p3 category and would offer protection against a heavy viral aerosol challenge however most of these are not easy to sterilize and neither licensed for medical use there is a risk of the virus staying alive on the respirator surface up to 3 days on plastic6 and hence their repeated use cannot be recommended in the context of the covid-19 pandemic it may be too expensive for these to be used on a disposable basis approximately 100 cost per piece but in case of dire shortage of supplies and if they can be mass-produced in the country they will have a potential role in clinical encounters such as the subject of this documentsurgical face masks are not designed for personnel protection and do not closely fit around the face and mouth their design is intended for preventing contamination of the surgical wound from the aerosols generating by the surgical team when tested for personal protection in lab settings they provide a 35 protection against a standard lab aerosol challenge3 there are no clinical studies comparing n95p2 masks to surgical masks for prevention against coronavirus but studies have compared these two masks in the setting of influenza virus which is a similar sized virus and is also airborne7 despite the differences we have seen in the lab settings there seem to be no difference in infection rates between these two groups in the clinical setting 2 randomised trials it is apparent that in the lab setting n95p2 masks are superior but in the clinical setting such a difference is not seenalso there is evidence to suggest that wearing a mask either surgical mask or n95 reduces the risks of acquiring the flu by the close contacts of patients when compared to no protection 3 arm randomised trial8 medical research council imperial college suggests the use of masks can reduce the chances of developing disease but notes that the compliance may be poor7
in light of the above evidence it can be inferred that the surgical masks are not a reliable protection against a knownsuspected covid-19 patient but they are useful to prevent the personnel against an accidental aerosol challenge from an asymptomatic carrier of sars-cov-2 during the incubation phase equally if a health worker is in the asymptomatic incubation phase this will reduce the aerosol challenge towards an uninfected patient or coworker5

7 by reducing the viral load acquired such facemasks are protective for personnel as they are likely to reduce the severity of illness especially at the height of the pandemicit is recommended that a known patient of covid-19 wears such a mask to reduce viral shedding and hence this measure is protective to the health workers these masks are also useful for symptomatic patients in self-quarantine to reduce viral load transmission to the rest of the members of family in quarantineaerosolsdroplet contamination via the eye can be prevented by routine use of glasses or visors6 such protection would be useful when a direct aerosol challenge may occur such as clinic appointments reception staff clinical examination physiotherapy phlebotomy radiology procedures etcdirect contact with contaminated surfaces may also lead to inoculation for example when the health worker examines the patient and then uses the contaminated hand to rub ones eye or touch their face sars-cov-2 is detectable for up to 4 h on copper up to 24 h on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel6
hence hand washing with soap and water or disinfecting gel is advisable before and after every patient contact a direct decontamination of all patient contact points is vital chairs door knobs pens clipboards etc many times each day it is advisable to avoid touching ones eyes nose or mouth it is advisable to cough or sneeze in a tissue and bin the tissue immediately if tissue is not immediately available it is best to cough and sneeze into the elbow9
the hospital should be divided into areas affiliated with a level of risk10
level 1  applicable to pre-exam triage and general outpatient deptdisposable surgical cap and maskwork uniformdisposable gloves and protective clothing
level 2  applicable to ae isolation wards fever clinics icu specimen examination of suspected or confirmed cases cleaning surgical instrumentsas above andmedical protective mask n95goggles
level 3  applicable to surgical theatres on suspected or confirmed cases intubation tracheotomy bronchoscopy endoscopy procedures with splashspray secretionsas above andfull face respiratory protective devices or powdered air-purifying respirator
although surgical hoods such as those made by stryker meet aami level 4 personal protection there has been no study looking at their effectiveness in covid-19 and as such their use cannot be recommendedminimize aerosol related spread-a safe distance of 6 feet is recommended during clinical encounters-surgical masks are recommended during all clinical encounters with asymptomatic patients surgical masks are recommended for personnel working in areas where air exchange is  3 h-n95 maskspositive pressure suits are recommended for mediumhigh risk clinical encounters-eye protection is recommended for all clinical encounters
minimize direct contamination-hand washing with soap and water or disinfecting gel is advisable before and after every patient contact-a direct decontamination of all patientstaff contact points is vital chairs door knobs pens clipboards keyboard mouse etc many times during the working day-it is advisable to avoid touching ones eyes nose or mouth it is advisable to cough or sneeze in a tissue and bin the tissue immediately if tissue is not immediately available it is best to cough and sneeze into the elbow

-minimize personnel entering operating theatre-ideally have a negative pressure operating area a buffer zone and a clean zone-put ppe on in the buffer zone dispose of it in the buffer zone-patients should have surgical masks and caps on
ideally divide into teams with each team only being in a level 2 or level 3 area for 4 h at a time10
the hospital should have a fever clinic running ie anyone who enters ae or miu will have their temperature taken those with a fever are taken to a fever clinic for further assessment this is a level 2 zonethere is no clear-cut guidance specifically related to staff with comorbidities however comorbidities that place individuals at greatest risk arehypertensioncardiac diseasecerebrovascular diseasediabetesrespiratory disease11
malignancy and immunodeficiencythose treated with ace-inhibitors and arbs are at greater risk12

copd is the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease and icu admission13
methylprednisolone has been linked to prolonged viral shedding14 and who advises against their use in covid-19 except for patients with an associated acute respiratory distress general corticosteroids have led to delayed viral shedding in mers-cov and sars-cov as well as psychosis and avascular necrosis in sars-cov and increased mortality in influenza15
in addition a previous study of over 15000 cases showed that intra articular steroid administration reduces the efficacy of the influenza vaccine and suggest susceptibility to viral load16
to date there are no papers specifically looking at intra articular steroid administration in coronavirus strain covid-19 but the advice from who regarding steroids is to avoid them unless the patient is in ards17
the current advice is not to take nsaids in covid-19 and to use paracetamol to treat symptoms18 there is speculation that the drug causes cytokine storms taking the drug in the early stages of the disease may induce prolonged illness or more severe respiratory or cardiac complicationsthe effectiveness of virtual fracture clinics in the uk is now well-established19 20 21 the same research has not been done for elective orthopaedics certainly from a follow-up perspective the virtual clinic is encouraged from the royal college of surgeons22 many countries across europe are now conducting telephone outpatient clinics in light of covid-19gmc has some guidance on this but it is limited they suggest ensuring the patient being assessed has capacity has a straightforward treatment request and that the clinician has all the necessary patient information to handthe newest guidance from the british orthopaedic association suggests changing all except the most essential from face-to-face clinics to virtual or telephone clinics23
each hospital will have its own escalation plan but in the first instance it is desirable for specialist teams to work within their own remit albeit working in emergency mode for example orthopaedic surgeons could staff trauma lists fracture clinics and minor injuries units to treat the walking wounded at some point however people will have to work outside their specialist areathere are studies emerging about the effects of this rapidly spreading disease on the mental health of health workers it is important that we support each other and recognise that every one is working outside of their comfort zone ensure rest and respite between shifts eat sufficiently and stay in regular contact with friends family and colleaguesat some point soon orthopaedic surgeons may have to step outside the comfort zone of trauma and orthopaedics and treat and triage any patient entering ae the royal college of surgeons has outlined this in its guidance for surgeons and has set out 5 key phasestriage and deliver healthcare and protect the workforcemaintain emergency surgery capabilitiesprotect and preserve the workforcefulfill alternate surgical rolesfulfill alternate non-surgical roles
it is therefore important that weunderstand the basics of covid-19recognise when to escalate to respiratory medics or icuare able to treat acute or emergent medical conditions as needed

there are two main routes of transmission for respiratory viruses aerosolization with droplet transmission and direct contact modes of transmission with the virus remaining viable for significant intervals of time between hours and days on most surfaces3 aerosolized transmission4 5 can be either droplet sars-cov-2 or airborne sars generally depending on the size of the expelled particle larger particles once expelled into the air tend to settle on surfaces or to the ground typically within 1 m of the source4 the sars-cov-2 like other corona viruses can be transmitted via droplets within close proximity during coughing or sneezing and thus the recommendation for individuals to remain 6 feet apart wwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovprevent-getting-sicksocial-distancinghtml the droplets can

surgical volume to create capacity for a surge in covid-19 patients the authors of this manuscript represent 13 different health systems including centers in hot spots of new york pennsylvania washington and michigan they have shared their best practices being used at their centers leading to a formulation of the best practices document the process was conducted by creating an initial template for the manuscript led by the first author this was iteratively revised by all authors a thorough search of prior publications led to a very limited reference list it was apparent that while a lot is being rapidly published on covid-19 the precise areas of critical interest for neurosurgical practice were severely limited in light of the lack of data we constructed the model where each author populated all the areas of the manuscript individually these submissions were then collated and edited to optimize the subject matter by the first author and circulated for edits from the larger group to create a concise repository of best practicesgiven the tremendous challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic there is a lack of data to support each of these recommendations and thus we present the best practices as options to adapt based on a health systems resources and goals we are presenting a consortium of practices based on pre-print publications studies of previous viral illnesses and emerging experience from major centers during a worldwide pandemicwhile a comprehensive definition of non-elective procedures is lacking and depends on individual presentations the following list includes procedures that are commonly understood as emergent or urgentacross the usa there is a general trend to cancelling elective procedures to minimize the number of healthcare providers at risk of exposure within the hospital environment donning and doffing of maximal ppe should be demonstrated and hand hygiene during this process should be emphasized given the importance of proper ppe placement in preventing exposure to the sars-cov-2 virus adherence should be monitoredmembers of the surgical anesthesia and neuromonitoring team should limit their movements within the or and between rooms so as to not expose clean areas to sars-cov-2 particulate matter this will require the placement of a team member outside the operative suite in case surgical equipment that is not present in the or suite is necessary for continuing the operation donning and doffing should take place within the anteroom to prevent exposure of clean areas to infectious matter from the operating suitegiven the multitude of or suites within most hospital settings it is ideal to concentrate all covid and pui cases within several covid designated ors such ors should ideally be attached to an anteroom as a mechanism of preventing exposure of clean areas in addition the designated covid-19 or suites should be divided into rooms focusing on three surgical types 1 neurosurgical otolaryngology and spinal procedures 2 general surgery transplant and trauma and 3 cardiothoracic and vascular surgery such division will allow for surgical specialty specific equipment to be housed within the dedicated covid or thus preventing movement of equipment from clean areas to covid designated areas and vice versa hybrid ors deserve special consideration and cross-specialty collaboration might be the only way to achieve economies of scale that allow focusing one or more hybrid ors for patients with covid and others for non-covid patientsgiven the positive pressure areas within the operative suite it is essential to have a negative pressure area with hepa filtration for doffing donning as well as intubation and extubation as both of these procedures will lead to significant aerosolization such an area is defined as the anteroom which needs to be attached to each covid designated operative suite and serves an essential feature of preventing contamination of adjacent clean areas post procedure the covid or should undergo a terminal clean of all exposed material from ceiling to floor including lightingdirect communication should take place between the transporting team to the or personnel in the room to be certain that all individuals have appropriate ppe before transport transportation of non-intubated patients should be done with a face mask in place portable ventilators and extensions to endotracheal tubes are important ways to prevent the need for disconnecting the circuit when a disconnection is necessary clamping of the endotracheal tube is essential to prevent aerosolizationintubations and extubations are ideally performed within a negative pressure room and thus the anteroom is a suitable location10 only the anesthesia team donning maximal ppe should be within the room when performing intubation and extubation in order to minimize exposure to other team members11 12 the surgical team should wait for a period of time post intubationextubation ideally corresponding to twice the predicted time of air turnover in the room to reduce the aerosolization content within the covid or environment before entering with maximal ppe including a n95 respirator given the rise in patients with covid-19 and thus the demand for icu beds and ventilators extubation post procedure should be emphasized thus freeing up a ventilator and icu room post extubation efforts should be made to transport the patient to a final destination rather than intermediary locations such as the post anesthesia care unit this will minimize the number of areas and personnel exposed to patients withcovid-19 however it may be more efficient to have the ability to turn an or suite into a negative pressure environment where the patient can be transported for extubation this will allow the covid or suite to be more efficiently used for surgical procedures rather than extended periods of time for recovery until extubation some may advocate extubating only outside of the or in particular to perform extubation in the critical care unit however this does not fully incorporate the flow of patients in the hospital especially in busy centers and may add a significant number of ventilator days during a time when ventilators are a scarce resourceneurosurgical procedures specifically involving the airways can lead to significant aerosolization and exposure of surgeons and others within the operative suite in addition high-speed bone drilling has been shown to increase production of contaminant aerosolized particulate matter as reported by workman et al13 and thus participants should be in full ppe in the same manner the use of electrocautery has also been shown to increase production of contaminated aerosolized particulate matter14 thus neurosurgical operative procedures involving endonasal approaches for tumor resection and pituitary surgeries as well as transoral approaches for spinal pathology should be avoided unless absolutely necessary such procedures should be some of the first cases delayed secondary to the substantial exposure of healthcare personnel to infectious particulate matterwith the continual rise of covid-19 cases it is plausible that there will be scarcity of appropriate ppes specifically n95 masks are integral to preventing exposure to covid-19 particulate matter and appear to be in short supply ideally n95 masks should be changed from patient to patient there are ongoing discussions regarding the reuse or sterilization of used n95 masks the fda has recently approved the use of hydrogen peroxide vapors to decontaminate n95 masks as this disinfects without compromising the mechanical integrity of the mask httpswwwfdagovmedia136386download innovative mechanisms of sterilizing used n95 respirators have also included heat and ultraviolet light sources as well as hydrogen peroxide vapors there is no evidence to support sterilization with ultraviolet light and heat without the possibility of reducing the effectiveness of the n95 respiratorreuse of n95s may be enhanced by wearing a surgical facemask over the n95 thus preventing its gross contamination in addition a replacement of the n95 mask could be the reusable elastomeric half-mask respirator ehmr which has the same ability to filter infected particulate matter and allows for a tight fit over the face in addition the face piece can be disinfected with alcohol or bleach and the cartridges can be replaced to allow for reuse pompeii et al
15 recently reported that healthcare personnel can be rapidly fit tested and trained to use the ehmr the utilization of other types of masks with the same functionality as the n95 has been discussed including the use of anesthesia face masks attached to hepa filter and straps see the occupational safety and health administration osha video on the application of n95 and ehmrs at httpswwwoshagovvideorespiratoryprotectionresptypeshtmla successful strategy for determining which invasive procedures should be allowed to proceed must take into consideration the medical urgency or risk to the patient the resources required before during and after the procedure and the resources available within the local health system one very reasonable approach was adopted by the trihealth hospital system in cincinnati ohio m delworth md d kirkpatrick md and is offered here for consideration the tiers of care take each of the factors listed previously into consideration so that lower priority higher level number cases are the first to be cancelled in a bottom up approach box 2while this stratification of case priority is clearly logical interpretation requires a nuanced understanding of the clinical conditions being considered for example a cerebrovascular or endovascular specialist may see cases of obviously high urgency such as stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage and cases clearly considered elective such as embolization of a low-grade dural fistula causing tinnitus however many other cases are in the grey zonefor example large unruptured aneurysms with significant yearly risk of rupture carotid endarterectomy or stent for symptomatic disease which should be done sooner rather than later as benefit wanes the longer one waitsconsideration should also be given to what kind of delay is reasonable in some situations when it comes to prioritizing patients on a future schedule on a way back towards normalcy many disease states may allow for several months of delay without any evidence of expectation of harm to the patient in excess of the periprocedural risk in itselfassignment of cases at priority levels ii and iii should consider the risk of progression or recurrence of disease the likely rate of that progression and the potential adverse effect on the patients outcome should progression or recurrence occur it must also take into consideration the resources required to perform the procedure and to manage the patient before and after the procedure one condition may have only a moderate concern for progression or recurrence but its management may require few critical resources and only a brief stay in hospital if any another may have a higher concern for progression or recurrence but require a lengthy stay in the icu possibly on a ventilator and use of critical resources for many days in this scenario the first procedure may be allowed to move forward but the second may not guidance for appropriate prioritization of common neurovascular procedures based on these criteria is given in box 3infection from the sars-cov-2 virus has led to the covid-19 pandemic given the large number of patients affected healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit however the need for urgent and emergent surgical and interventional care will continue we describe best practice options when providing neurosurgical treatment of patients with covid-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff the described best practices may apply to a variety of operative and interventional procedures given that the goal of preventing sars-cov-2 exposure is of the utmost importance in all disciplinesthe new emergent coronavirus severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 broke out in wuhan china 1 the virus immediately spread worldwide causing many covid-19 cases and deaths sars-cov-2 resides in the upper respiratory tract and spreads via droplets from coughing or sneezing the world health organization recommends washing hands with soap maintaining social distancing and avoiding crowded places to prevent the spread of viral infections 2 in addition to these preventive measures most countries recommend travel restrictions and curfewsinfluenza viruses rhinoviruses adenoviruses coronaviruses 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 and the human metapneumovirus cause common cold-like symptoms 3 of these viruses influenza viruses are an annual epidemic in the winter owing to the development of treatments and vaccines the mortality rate from influenza viruses is lowin december 2019 the sars-cov-2 outbreak coincided with the influenza viral epidemic seasonal influenza activity in japan was lower in 2020 than in previous years 4 however whether sars-cov-2 is more infectious than other viruses remains unknown here we performed genetic analyses to determine which viruses were spreading in the japanese population this epidemiologic study shows the infectability of each virus after implementing social preventive measures against sars-cov-2we studied 191 patients exhibiting cold-like symptoms from 10 march 2020 to 7 may 2020 in our district 100150 km west of tokyo japan nasopharyngeal samples were collected from all patients using cotton swabs and universal transport media copan murrieta ca usa the institutional review board at yamanashi central hospital approved this study and the use of an opt-out consent method g-2019-1 the requirement for written informed consent was waived participation in the study by patients was optionalto analyze the viral species related to patients respiratory diseases we performed multiplex pcr targeting 17 viruses and three bacterial species using the filmarray respiratory panel biomrieux marcy-letoile france per the manufacturers instructions briefly buffer and 300 l from the nasopharyngeal swab were injected into the filmarray pouch the reaction proceeded automatically on the filmarray torch system the limit of detection was listed as previously reported table 1
 5the total nucleic acid was automatically isolated from the nasopharyngeal swabs using the magmax viralpathogen nucleic acid isolation kit thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa on kingfisher duo prime thermo fisher scientific as previously described 67 to detect sars-cov-2 we performed rt-pcr as previously described 78 the rt-pcr assays were conducted on a steponeplus real-time pcr system with the following cycling conditions 50 c for 5 min for reverse transcription 95 c for 20 s and 45 cycles of 95 c for 3 s and 60 c for 30 s the threshold cycle ct value was assigned to each pcr reaction and the amplification curve was visually assessedof 191 patients 32 17 were infected at least one causative virus including human rhinovirusenterovirus n  11 human metapneumovirus n  7 coronavirus 229e n  4 coronavirus oc43 n  3 adenovirus n  2 respiratory syncytial virus n  2 and coronavirus nl63 n  1 table 2
 two patients were simultaneously infected with two viruses each one with adenovirus and human rhinovirusenterovirus and one with adenovirus and human metapneumovirus table 2 however no influenza a ah1 ah3 ah1-2009 or b viruses were detected thus influenza viruses either have a very low prevalence in our district or were prevented by the intensive measures taken against coronavirusesrt-pcr performed on samples from the same cohort of 191 patients detected that 8 were infected with sars-cov-2 the filmarray respiratory panel showed that these 8 patients were uninfected with any other causative virus fig 1
 thus the sars-cov-2 infection prevalence was 4 while the influenza viral prevalence was 0 in this cohort fig 1 this comparative analysis suggests that sars-cov-2 was much more infectious than the influenza viruses were under the same conditions in the same regionthe respiratory panel detected that 17 of the cohort 32191 patients were infected with causative viruses seven viral species were detected none of which were influenza viruses at the start of the coronavirus epidemic the infectivity of sars-cov-2 was unknown compared to that of influenza viruses our data implies that influenza viral spread would be suppressed under the preventive measurethis study evaluated the differences in infectivity between sars-cov-2 and influenza viruses infection prevention measures such as handwashing and mask wearing led to fewer influenza infections 9 mask wearing is a common practice among japanese in the winter after japanese government announced on the citizen to take preventive measures behavioural changes ie avoid crowded places wearing a mask handwashing with soap and hand sanitizers were as clearly observed at the end of march 10 sakamoto et al analyzed epidemiological data from 20142020 and showed that the number of seasonal influenza cases was lower in 2020 than in previous years in japan 4 these observations along with the current results suggest different infectious activity levels between seasonal influenza viruses and sars-cov2we revealed the infection rate of respiratory viruses as well as sars-cov-2 table 2 recent study showed surgical mask is important to prevent viral shedding 9 in particular detection rate of common coronavirus and influenza virus decreased in droplet and aerosol after waring mask but less effective for rhinovirus 9 concordant with these results our data showed highest infection rate is caused by the rhinovirus  enterovirus common coronavirus such as 229e oc43 and nl63 were detected in a few patients compared to sars-cov-2 although it still unknown to what extent face mask has the same effects in sars-cov-2 to common coronavirus it could be important for preventing airborne transmission 11although this was a prospective study there were limitations first this study was conducted by a single-center in our district national registry indicated a marked reduction in influenza viral infections at the end rather than at the beginning of winter 4 which coincided with our study second it needs a comparator group a retrospective andor prospective study with data before and after preventive measure against would answer the difference of infectivity among viruses third the influenza vaccination status was not investigated the less infection rate of influenza virus would be explained by vaccination instead we examined the statistical surveys of vaccination rates for all japanese citizens published by the government overall trend shows the vaccination rate from 2007 to 2017 is almost 50 range 482-559 although the latest data are not yet available it is likely that the vaccination rate would not change significantly in 2020 in this context further studies should verify whether preventive social measures reduced the infection prevalence of influenza viral transmissionthis study showed that taking stringent measures may prevent influenza viruses which have more strongly affected human

the corresponding author upon reasonable requestnot applicablesars is a serious infectious disease that is associated with a novel coronavirus25sars evolved into a global outbreak in march 200368in november 2002 many cases of highly infectious and severe atypical pneumonia of unknown origin were noted in guangdong province in southern china in retrospect the clinical features fit into the who case definition of sars however it was not reported widely at that stage sars was first recognised in hong kong in late february 2003910the index case a doctor from southern china had been unwell before travelling to hong kong he was admitted to one of the public hospitals in hong kong with symptoms of atypical pneumonia immediately an outbreak was triggered firstly in the hospital and later spreading widely throughout the communityon 12 march 2003 the who issued a global sars alert8the who subsequently received reports of the syndrome from china singapore vietnam canada the us and germany on 21 march 2003 the who issued a preliminary clinical description of sars11according to the description the majority of sars patients were previously healthy adults aged between 25 and 70 years all patients presented with high fever 38c sometimes associated with chills rigor malaise myalgia and other respiratory symptoms the mortality rate was high reaching 20 the literature to date suggests that sars is associated with a novel coronavirusthe accepted case definition of sars is that proposed by the who and adopted by the us center of disease control and prevention cdc current criteria for defining a case include clinical data epidemiological data and laboratory tests according to the cdc the sars case definition was revised on 23 may 2003 with the clinical criteria being categorised as i asymptomatic ii mild respiratory illness iii moderate respiratory illness fever 38c cough dyspnoea or hypoxia or iv severe respiratory illness additional radiological evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndromeepidemiological criteria include close contact with sars cases or travel to an area with community transmission of sars laboratory criteria have been added as evidence of infection with sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov probable cases refer to those meeting the clinical criteria for severe respiratory illness of unknown aetiology and satisfying the epidemiological criteria suspect cases refer to those meeting the clinical criteria for moderate respiratory illness of unknown aetiology and satisfying the epidemiological criteriathe mean incubation period of the sars virus is 46 days and 95 of patients experience the onset of symptoms within 1422 days of infection1patients with sars usually present with high fever temperature 38c dry cough chills and rigor and prodromal symptoms malaise myalgia headache and dizziness291012the relative frequencies of all reported symptoms vary slightly in different case clustersin the first reported sars case series lee et al9reported that all patients presented with fever temperature 38c for 24 hours and a majority with chills and rigors 73 prodromal symptoms 5060 and coughing 579productive cough sore throat coryza nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea were less common symptoms based on their data lee et al9proposed that the presentation of sars was triphasic the first phase termed the viral replication phase occurred in the first week with most patients presenting with fever myalgia and chills as the disease progressed into second week 70 of the patients developed early immune response and cytokines were found in the blood stream in this immune hyperactive phase there was significant lung destruction and patients began to develop respiratory symptoms and observable chest radiographic changes in the third week patients entered the pulmonary destruction phase which clinically resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome canadian data suggest that the earliest symptoms are fever prodromal symptoms cough or dyspnoea and diarrhoea2from the outbreak in amoy gardens in hong kong peiris et al13found that many patients developed recurrent fever 85 and watery diarrhoea 73in general physical examination on admission will show high temperature 38c generally ranging from 35403c tachycardia tachypnoea and borderline low blood pressure may be observed oxygen saturation level on normal air condition may be at borderline situation inspiratory crackles are usually heard at the base of the lung but wheezing is an uncommon finding rash lymphadenopathy and purpura are rarethe coronavirus is one of the two most common pathogens for upper respiratory tract infection urti14and it is also the most probable pathogen for sars4transmission methods may therefore be similar for both infections the who has reported that sars is not airborne but is carried in virus-laden droplets1this suggests that transmission is possible when aerosolised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible hosts mucous membranes most commonly the nose but also with the mouth and eyes the virus has been found to be stable in faeces and urine at room temperature for at least 12 days15transmission through a defective sewage system was in fact proven in the case of the outbreak at amoy gardens estate in hong kong16the sars virus has been reported as occurring in saliva tears and urine1at the time of writing no evidence of the sars virus in a patients sweat has been reported nevertheless it is still reasonable to assume that the sars virus may be present in a patients sweat as it is in other bodily fluids as summarised by the who1the sars-cov has been isolated after 36 hours from seating paper a formica surface a plastered wall after 72 hours from a plastic surface and stainless steel and after 96 hours on a glass slide it is therefore possible that the virus can be transmitted by hands that have been in contact with these infected surfacesparticipation in sports training and competition may further add to the above list of possible transmission pathways sharing sporting equipment and practice surfaces can be another potential means of transmission sars-infected bodily fluids and respiratory secretions can contaminate sporting equipment and practice surfaces close personal contact during training and competition in contact sports wrestling judo basketball etc can further transmit sars from person to persona crowded changing room where dense steam and vapour is generated from hot showers can be dangerous in the sense that aerosolised viral particles can be transmitted from any viral carrier to the whole team this is the most probable transmission pathway of the outbreak in amy gardens hong kong steam and vapour enhance the floating time of the virus-carrying droplets1frequent travel may further increase the probability of transmission in sports environments staying in relatively crowded aircraft or vehicles with poor ventilation can be risky if there is an infected person travelling with the team however the who17reported on 23 may 2003 that symptomatic probable sars cases on only four flights have been associated with possible transmission onboard olsen et al18concluded that sars may occur on an aircraft when infected persons travel during the symptomatic phase of illness therefore it is still advisable to take precautions to prevent possible transmission during flightsavoiding contact with the virus is the ultimate way to prevent infection possible measures range from avoiding unnecessary contact with people especially those who are infected wearing masks in high-risk areas to applying sound personal hygiene practicedaily monitoring of body temperature before practice will help to identify infected athletes within the team fever has been identified as one of the major symptoms of sars4it is generally believed that sars patients will become infectious only after the development of symptoms it has also been found that sars is most infectious on the tenth day of infection and it is rare for patients who have been isolated within 5 days of becoming ill to transmit infection1hence isolating individuals with fever will be one of the most effective and practical ways to avoid contact athletes experiencing fever should not be allowed to train and immediate medical advice should be soughtmaintaining personal hygiene is another way to reduce the risk of infection based on the fact that the sars virus can be found in excreta15hand washing after using the bathroom should be strictly applied frequent hand washing especially after touching public facilities and before rubbing ones own nose mouth and eyes are effective in preventing the transfer of the virus from contaminated surfaces to the mucous membranes covering the mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing is also essential used tissue paper should be treated properly and put in a covered rubbish bin or flushed down the toilet universal precautions19should be applied to the handling of blood and bodily fluids including vomitus nasal secretions etcathletes with urinary and bowel stomas or difficulty with bladder and bowel control should pay special attention to sealing off any leakage before exercise particularly for water sport eventsat time of writing there have been no reports on the survival of the sars virus in patients sweat however sweat should be treated as a possible means of transmitting sars showering after training is therefore recommended to help to control the potential spread in sports activities involving close contact eg wrestling showering before training and competition is also recommended20minor abrasions should be cleaned with soap and water before applying antiseptic cream and bandaging to prevent entry of the virus clothing used during practice should be changed and laundered everyday sporting equipment should be sanitised with diluted bleach 1 part bleach in 99 parts water daily similarly practice surfaces should be cleaned with diluted bleach both before and after trainingother personal hygiene practices should include special precautions during meals to prevent cross contamination when sharing food the use of serving utensils should be encouraged before serving all food should be properly covered to minimise any possible contaminationresistance to infection depends upon the general state of health of an individual as well as the individuals innate and adaptive immunological competence21other factors that influence susceptibility include the dose and virulence of the infecting micro-organism8as sars is an extremely virulent virus it is important to enhance the immune system to reduce the risk of infection at the time of writing no study has been published investigating the relationship between exercise immunity and sars therefore studies examining the relationship between urti and exercise may improve our understanding of the relationship between sars and exercisethere is a current consensus that moderate exercise can enhance immune function and thus resistance to viral infection shephard22and peters23have stated that a high level of physical conditioning had in a few carefully controlled recent studies provided evidence of a lower incidence of infection symptoms and chronic immunomodulation helping to increase resistance to infection nieman et al24have noted that 45 minutes of exercise five times per week at 60 of the heart rate reserve reduced the duration of respiratory symptoms but did not affect the incidence of urti in 25- to 45-year-old women in a later study nieman et al25investigated the relationship between poor immune function and low levels of physical activity in a group of elderly women they concluded that any benefit of regular physical activity was more obvious in this group in this study they found that among 67- to 85-year-old women the incidence of urti was lowest in a highly conditioned subgroup intermediate in a subgroup of regular walkers and highest in callisthenic and sedentary control subgroups they suggested that t cells were the major component of the immune system to be altered with age and that a highly conditioned elderly woman might have t cells that function at levels above their sedentary counterparts but still somewhat lower than those of young women on the other hand natural killer cell activity was considerably greater in highly conditioned elderly women than in either sedentary elderly or young women hence continuous regular moderate exercise can boost the immune systems of elderly womenone concern about sars and physical training is that there are reports that a small number of sars patients were asymptomatic1this group consisted largely of elderly patients if an individual is training with another individual who has contracted sars but without obvious symptoms fever the risk will be very high fever is a consequence of the immune systems response to eradicate the invading virus therefore it is usually only those who have weak immune systems such as the elderly26who will not have an immune response to the invading virus those who exercise regularly will have a better immune system and will have a normal immune response26therefore exercising with someone who is active and has no symptoms of sars will probably constitute a low risk of contracting sarson the other hand nieman et al24stated that runners training 96 kmweek doubled their odds for sickness urti compared with those training 32 kmweek it has been suggested that athletes engaging in marathon-type events andor engaged in very heavy training are at increased risk of urti27 this may due to the fact that acute exercise a single bout of intense exercise temporarily decreases the activity of several of the immune systems cellular components and increases athletes susceptibility to viruses28however shephard22in his more recent review stated that in terms of the adverse effects on the immune system due to very heavy exercise and training all of the expected epidemiological criteria associated with a cause and effect relationship have not been met in earlier studies therefore very high-intensity exercise may not be the causal factor of the lowered immune systemthis controversy may in part be due to the variation in defining heavy or very high-intensity exercise weidner29summarised that people who exceeded their individual exercise limit activity frequency intensity and duration might be fostering infection for competitive athletes it is impossible for them to train at low to moderate intensity but in order to avoid the adverse effects on the immune system due to high-intensity workouts athletes training must be systematically monitored to prevent training beyond individual limits and chronic overtrainingnieman27 also concluded that following acute bouts of prolonged high-intensity endurance exercise several components of the immune system are suppressed for several hours this has led to the concept of the open window theory which was described as the 1- to 9-hour period following prolonged endurance exercise when the hosts defences are decreased and the risk of urti is increased during this open window period athletes should be advised to remain isolated from all the possible sources of infectionin addition to regular exercise there are other means to improve immunity against possible sars infection they include diet proper rest and reduced psychological stress an efficient immune system requires a number of nutrients to sustain itself essential amino acids the essential fatty acid  linoleic acid retinol vitamin a folic acid pyridoxine vitamin b6 cyanocobalamin vitamin b12 ascorbic acid vitamin c tocopherol vitamin e zinc copper iron and selenium have all been found to be beneficial to the immune system30other nutrients that may help to maintain a healthy immune system include arginine glutamine omega-3-fatty acids and nucleotides3132sleep deprivation is known to have a detrimental effect on the immune system33getting enough sleep and proper rest is therefore also important in ensuring an efficient immune system furthermore psychological stress and depression were found to be associated with immunosuppression3435a stress cytokine depression model has been proposed as a biological pathway to explain the link between stressful life events and depression35it is generally agreed that the stress associated with competition may make athletes more susceptible to infectious illnesses36declines in immune function can be related to heavy training prior to competition2324psychological stress related to competition37the exposure to extremes of heat and cold sleep deprivation and time-zone shifts3839whether exercise is recommended during and after contracting sars is an interesting topic for discussion during the acute phase of the sars disease it is almost impossible for the patient to perform any exercise in the presence of severe symptoms that may include fever temperature 38c for 24 hours rigor dry cough dyspnoea malaise headache and hypoxaemia11relative rest is therefore recommended during this phase of the diseasecarefully prescribed exercise has been found to be an essential part of treatment or rehabilitation programme for various chronic diseases such as cardiac disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hypertension and asthma23293640it is therefore expected that an individually prescribed exercise programme that aims to improve cardiorespiratory function and general wellbeing will also be beneficial to stabilised sars patients a muscle strengthening programme may be prescribed prior to cardiovascular training after weeks of bed rest muscle condition may decrease significantly40therefore muscle strengthening programmes especially for lower body muscles are required before recovering patients can perform other locomotory rehabilitation programmes however extra attention should be given to the possible presence of any postviral fatigue syndrome this is the prolonged period of debilitation sometimes observed during the recovery phase from an apparent viral infection24although there has been no report to date of any postviral fatigue syndrome in relation to sars the risk of an extended clinical course resulting from attempts to work through this syndrome should be noted38a mask serves the function of blocking the release of disease-causing aerosols from the patient to the external air space when they speak exhale cough or sneeze and stopping or blocking the disease-causing aerosols being transferred to healthy people when they inhale therefore the surgical mask must be able to inhibit aerosol penetration mccullough et al41stated that the penetration rate of aerosols through a surgical mask depended on the flow rate and the type of organism in the aerosols when mycobacterium abscessus and bacillus subtilis were assessed at a high flow rate 85 lmin there was significantly higher penetration than what was seen at a low flow rate 45 lmin the surgical mask was much less efficient in blocking aerosols than was the n95 mask41the surgical mask with a filter had a 25 penetration rate of sub-micrometre-sized aerosols at a flow rate of 5 lmin to 70 at 100 lmin42the penetration rate through surgical masks can be well over 25 when the children are working or exercising at moderate or maximal intensity the maximal ventilation rate for children aged 112  14 years in hong kong has been found to be about 467  101 lmin for girls and 503  110 lmin for boys unpublished data therefore protection afforded by surgical masks may be minimalreaerosolisation cannot be neglected when exercising with a mask wang et al43and willeke and qian44indicated that some reaerosolisation 01 was possible in n92 masks during violent sneezing or coughing therefore when using a surgical mask reaerosolisation of the trapped virus is possible under continuous high flow rate during exercisewearing a mask incurs some penalties associated with the interference between wearers and the environment johnson et al45noted that workers wearing masks could not work as long or as hard as they could when not wearing masks such phenomena may also occur in exercise lerman et al46found that with the increase in inspiratory resistance due to wearing a mask during exercise testing a significant decrease in physical performance and tidal volume an increase in the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory time peak inspiratory pressure and increased co2 retention were observed they concluded that difficulty in inspiration was significantly correlated with inspiratory resistance and seemed to be the main reason for cessation of effort wilson and raven47also noted that wearing of respirator masks reduced forced vital capacity by an average of 116 065l forced expiratory volume in 1 second by 73 033l and maximum voluntary ventilation in 15 seconds by 74 124 lmin they hypothesised that the difference in peak inspired flow with and without the respirator was the best predictor of performance time with the respirator during an endurance walk to exhaustion therefore the resistance of the mask results in a detrimental effect on exercise performance especially at maximal loadingone study found a statistically significant decrease in maximal oxygen uptake vo2max for participants wearing respirator masks compared with those without masks45the authors also found that the lactate and ventilation threshold were not affected by the mask condition therefore masks may only cause significant impairment of exercise at intensities 8085 of vo2max at about the anaerobic threshold level48in summary taking the safety issue and effects on exercise capacity into consideration children can only work or exercise at their submaximal level below the anaerobic threshold if they are wearing surgical masks however there are still some other factors that have to be considered such as air temperature and relative humidity before suggesting that children exercise with masksafter the outbreak of sars in early march the education authority of hong kong announced that all primary and secondary school classes were suspended in late march 2003 all school children were advised to stay home and avoid physical contact with others seven weeks later when sars was under control secondary and primary school classes were resumed on 16 and 23 may 2003 respectively the local education authority mandated that all students and teachers should wear masks all the time in schoolsa survey was conducted by a local hong kong university to determine how the school pe and extra-curricular activity programmes were being affected after classes had resumed questionnaires were sent out to 400 secondary and 712 primary school pe teachers within 1 week 276 secondary and 530 primary school pe teachers had responded table i shows a brief summary of the findings concerning the special arrangements made by the schools

in addition the survey further investigated the perceptions of the pe teachers on the influences on the pe programme of the sars preventive measures in school settings half 50 of the secondary and 46 of the primary school pe teachers reported adjustments to their normal pe curriculum most curriculum time involved changes to individual sports such as badminton and table-tennis in order to avoid physical contact among the students most major team sports like basketball and soccer were suspended during pe lessons and after school activities as a result a noticeable drop in students physical activity levels was indicated by pe teachers based on subjective observation secondary and primary school pe teachers reported an average 32 and 40 decline in physical activity levels respectively over 50 of the respondents revealed that pe apparatus and equipment was not clean enough and there were insufficient staff members to clean up such apparatus before a pe class moreover 25 of the pe teachers revealed that the changing rooms were unclean over half 53 of secondary and 47 of primary school pe teachers were worried about their students being infected during pe classessars is a highly infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus with possible severe clinical sequelae not only has it put enormous strain on the healthcare system worldwide it has also affected the physical psychological and social behaviours of affected communities across the globe without exception sports activities and sports medicine practices have also been affected with adequate knowledge of sars and common sense we stand a better chance of avoiding the sars panic spreading worldwidethe old proverb prevention is better than cure still holds true after all sars is basically another viral infection most likely spread by infectious droplets or direct contact good personal hygiene measures and strengthening the bodys immune system are important issuesif an athlete has been exposed to the virus or has suspected symptoms early recognition and prompt isolation are important basic measures active ongoing research on the development of vaccines and the most effective treatment is boomingmost likely the impact of sars on sport will go far beyond just the possible need of medical treatment of sars patients some issues like pre-event screening for infection or for symptomatic individuals sport events planning to allow quarantine measures special travel arrangements and venue designs with good ventilation and filtering systems are areas that need to be reviewedthe emerging disease covid19 caused by the new coronavirus sarscov2 was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019

 however it is often difficult to wash hands in time and current medical masks which are usually called surgical masks are in shortage in many countries people in some countries have been encouraged to make masks by themselves at home to guard against sarscov2 but it remains unclear whether these homemade masks are effective to block the virus moreover many people have been confused about the claims of some politicians and scientists that medical masks are not useful to protect humans from the infection of sarscov2in this study we evaluated the efficacy of three types of masks in blocking avian influenza virus aiv in aerosols and the efficacy of instant hand wiping in removing aiv from hands aiv was used to mock sarscov2 because they are both enveloped and pleomorphic spherical viruses with a diameter of around 80 to 120 nm we also reviewed previous reports regarding the efficacy of masks

 with these data we propose a simple approach to slow the spread of the pandemic coronaviruslow pathogenic aiv achickenqingdao2112019 was isolated from qingdao live bird market in 2019 the virus was propagated using embryonated eggs virus quantification was performed using a realtime taqman reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr assay reported previously

the efficacy of instant hand wiping in removing aiv from hands was evaluated using a towel soaked in water containing soap powder or sodium hypochloritetype 403 nebulizer yuyue medical equipment  supply company jiangsu china was used to produce aerosols the aerosols have the median diameters 39 m and 65 of the aerosols have the diameters less than 50 m as given in the specification of the nebulizer the top parts of 60ml syringes were removed and then wrapped with the tested masks namely onelayer polyester cloth a homemade mask made of onelayer polyester cloth plus fourlayer kitchen paper hengan company fujian china each layer contains three thin layers a medical mask ammex company shanghai china and an n95 mask type new 2001 jiande chaomei daily chemical company zhejiang china respectively figure 1 qvs facial cleaning sponge 8mm thick watsons company guangdong china made of hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol was set inside the syringe behind the mask figure 1 for collecting the virus passing through the masks the four syringes were then aligned and bound seamlessly togetherin principle if the virus amount declines by 50 the c
t value of the realtime taqman rtpcr shall increase by 1 our experiment with three repeats showed that the virus amount declined by 50 the c
t value increased by 096 95 confidence interval 086104 using 18 serially diluted allantoic fluid of inoculated embryonated eggs containing the aiv taken together we presumed that the virus amount declines by 50 if the c
t value increases by 1 and the virus amount declines by 100  1  12y if the c
t value increases by y in this studywe put 5 l of the undiluted allantoic fluid containing the aiv on the hand of one author of this study and spread the fluid around the palm and kept for 3 minutes we then wiped the palm three times from the root of the palm to the tips of the fingers using a towel soaked in water containing soap or sodium hypochlorite and then wrung to remove most of the water inside we eluted the hand using 5 ml phosphatebuffered saline pbs and rna from 200 l of the eluted pbs was extracted for the detection of the amount of the virus using the taqman rtpcr each treatment and the control without wiping were conducted independently for three times table 1 showed as compared with the control without the towel wiping the virus on the palm declined by 9836 9662 and 9998 through wiping using the wet towel soaked in water containing 100 gg soap powder 005 gg active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite or 025 gg active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite respectively all the relevant c
t values in table 1 were of significant difference p  01 by the t test except those two pertaining to 100 soap powder and 005 active chlorinethe allantoic fluid containing the aiv was 110 diluted using pbs the fluid was added into the nebulizer for producing the aerosols containing the virus the aerosols were collected using a seamless plastic bag figure 1 the nebulizer was paused when the bag was bulging the air containing the aerosols was inhaled into and out of the syringes for 100 times through the synchronous piston movement of the four syringes to mock human breath then the mask was unwrapped and the sponge inside the syringe was taken out and added with 2 ml pbs the sponge was pressed for five times using a 200l pipette tip rna from 1 ml of the pbs was extracted for the detection of the amount of the virus using the taqman rtpcr each treatment was conducted independently for four times table 2 showed that as compared with the polyester cloth the n95 mask blocked 9998 of the virus and the medical mask blocked 9714 of the virus and the homemade mask blocked 9515 of the virus all the relevant c
t values were of significant difference p  01 by the t test except those two pertaining to the medical masks and the homemade masksbecause clean water is often unavailable at hand people can be infected through handmouth handnose or handeye contact before handwashing in this sense it is important to have one item at hand such as 75 alcohol hand sanitizer gel disinfecting wipes for instant hand hygiene after we have touched something possibly contaminated by the virus this is more important for those traveling longdistance using public vehicles or having touched some items frequently touched by other people this study suggested that instant hand wiping using a wet towel containing soap or sodium hypochlorite removed most viruses from hands water containing 100 soap powder is not only helpful for wiping away the virus using its surfactant activity but also efficiently inactivates enveloped viruses including coronavirus as proved by multiple previous studies
17

19
 moreover water containing 100 soap powder is safe for skin and other items including clothes it is worth noting that the concentration of soap powder and sodium hypochlorite is vital for their wiping and virucidal effectsvarious studies have suggested that sarscov2 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols

 and so hand hygiene is inadequate to prevent infection of sarscov2 and blocking masks are needed this study showed that n95 masks blocked nearly all the mock virus and medical masks blocked approximately 97 of the virus and the homemade mask blocked approximately 95 of the virus therefore the medical masks are not fully protective in hospitals but are useful for common social occasions when medical masks are in shortage the homemade masks made of fourlayer kitchen paper each layer contains three thin layers and one layer of polyester cloth should be helpful as indicated by this study the kitchen paper is effective in blocking the virus possibly because of its multiple layers nonwoven structure and virusabsorbing property as we have tested by ourselves the tested homemade masks are more breathable than the n95 masks one advantage of the homemade mask is that the kitchen paper can be changed frequently it is worth noting that the homemade masks shall be of less blocking efficacy if made of fewer layers of kitchen paper other types of homemade masks especially those made of cloth alone may be unable to block the virus and thus confer no protection against the virus
20
 
21
 additionally although a person inhales much more than 100 times a day the mocking data are reliable because aerosols containing the virus to be inhaled by a person on most common social occasions are fewer than in this experimentsome randomized controlled trials rcts did not support the efficacy of medical masks because medical masks could not reduce infection rates of some viral respiratory diseases
14
 
15
 consequently people in some countries opposed to using medical masks on common social occasions in effect the conclusions of these rcts could be erroneous as reflected by the following assumed scenario supposed the virus could have ten opportunities to infect a human during a period of 30 days wearing medical masks could block three of the 10 opportunities and thus reduce the infection risk by 30 although it itself could not block the other seven opportunities during the 30 days therefore the fact that medical maskwearing did not reduce the infection rate could suggest that medical maskwearing is inadequate to prevent the infection rather than useless for reducing the infection risk some other rcts and many nonrandomized studies regarding the use of medical masks supported the notion that wearing medical masks could reduce infection risks of some viral respiratory diseases

 moreover medical maskwearing can enhance ones vigilance prevent direct handmouth or handnose contact and reduce air contamination of pathogens from infected peoplewith the above data and discussion we propose herein the approach of maskwearing and instant hand hygiene mih namely that common people should wear effective masks and bring an appropriate item for instant hand hygiene when needed to slow the rapid spread of the virus worldwide this is crucial for the world to reduce severe and fatal cases of the virus before successful marketing of the effective vaccines against the coronavirus and avoid the tragedy of medical systems being overwhelmed by a surge of too many patients as indicated in this study when medical masks and disinfectants are in shortage the homemade masks made of kitchen paper can be used to temporally surrogate medical masks and so soap powder is used for instant hand hygienefrom the news we know that the mih approach has been implemented in china republic of korea and japan where maskwearing is widely accepted and items for instant hand hygiene are usually accessible in public areas the spread of the coronavirus in all these three countries has been well controlled

 in contrast iran italy spain and the usa did not implement the mih approach in the beginning weeks and many people in those countries are reluctant to wear medical masks none of these four countries have decelerated the spread of the coronavirus so far

the authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsdesign jmc qxm hs experiment qxm hlz gml rmy data analysis jmc qxm hs funding hs manuscript writing jmc hsthe article does not contain the participation of animals and humans other than the authorsat the writing of this manuscript the deadly novel coronavirus is on a rampage having infected nearly 42 million people worldwide already claiming about 6 of them while airborne droplets emitting from the cough and sneeze of the infected population is directly implicated for the spread of the disease details on the risks associated with different human activities like sneezing coughing and even talking aloud for transmission of this deadly virus are still emerging beans 2020 as a consequence advisories on use of masks especially by non-affected population outside the care-giving fraternity have seen significant revisions both at the national and international levels although who advisory  httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019advice-for-publwhen-and-how-to-use-masks2020 had earlier recommended the use of n95 face masks for all healthcare professionals and the patients it discouraged the use of n95 masks by common people  primarily to ease the pressure on n95 demand so those who really need the masks can get them the latest advisory world health organization 2020 has listed benefits of mask use even by the unaffected population similarly the indian ministry of health and family welfare has modified its earlier advisory ministry of health and family welfare 2020a for the use of masks by only affected individuals and frontline caregivers to recommend use of ordinary ie non-n95 grade homemade masks made of cloth by every individual ministry of health and family welfare 2020b thus there is now a general urgency for widespread production and use of protective masks to reduce risk of both infection by asymptomatic carriers and community-level infection of healthy individuals in the present situation it is difficult to supply masks to each and every corner of a large country like india moreover the high price of some available masks is prohibitive for a large a section of our population thus preventing the widespread use of masksa crucial piece of information for designing protective masks and assessing their efficacy is the fluid dynamic data related to coughing and sneezing namely volume flow rate of air ejected along with number density size and velocity distributions of the ejected droplets and aerosols both these factors play determining roles in the trajectory of the droplets and their longevity as air-borne particles although such detailed studies in the context of covid-19 virus transmission are expectedly scarce in the peer-reviewed open literature similar studies are available in the context of other air-borne infectious diseases like influenza and earlier versions of corona virus like sars and mers high-speed flow visualization studies have shown that during violent respiratory events like sneezing and coughing the pathogen-carrying droplets of diameter 10 m may remain suspended even at several meters away from the source bouroiba et al 2014 moreover such small droplets from the cough or sneeze cloud can be re-suspended by the ambient air currents having velocities of the order of 1 cms a study on the fluid dynamics of cough gupta et al 2009 has shown that the instantaneous volume flow rate of air could be represented as a combination of gamma functions whose parameters vary with the medical condition of an individual a typical cough was observed to generate peak flow rates in the range 385 ls in males and 166 ls in females while the total volume exhaled was 4001600 ml in males and 2501250 ml in females it was found that sequential coughs were combinations of single coughs the first cough was found to be identical to a single cough while the second one was a scaled-down version of the first yang et al 2007 reported that the average droplet size distribution was 058542 m and 82 of the droplets were in the range 074212 m thus face masks have dual challenges of preventing liquid penetration for high-velocity droplets from inside to outside during cough and sneeze and also the ingress of suspended droplets from the ambienthere we discuss an effort by cast jadavpur university to develop a simple procedure for making a three-layer mask from low cost readily available materials the choice of materials which in this case are readily available in a house or in the neighborhood is important since the supply of raw materials is an issue in these days of lock-down or restricted mobility we ensured that by using these materials the effectiveness of the mask has not been sacrificed the process is simple enough to make a mask on ones own in any of the available diy designs templates chosen by the individual at the same time we paid particular attention to the salient functional requirements of the mask 1 compared to the n95 masks which is strictly recommended for acute patients and healthcare professionals the masks are more breathable so that people can wear it over longer duration without serious discomfort this implies that the pore size is larger than the n95 filters 2 the three layers should prevent escape of droplets as the wearer sneezes through it and at the same time the innermost layer of the mask should remain dry to ensure comfort 3 the mask should prevent ingress of droplets from the ambient during inhalationboth through the fabric and the gap between the face and the mask 4 the mask is easy to sanitizedisinfect for re-usethe combination of stacked hydrophobic-hydrophilic-hydrophobic layers typically follows the principle of liquid diode which is characterized by preferential transport of liquid droplets mates et al 2014 chen et al 2012 a porous substrate having a hydrophobic top and an underlying hydrophilic layer will allow a liquid droplet to pass through the top and spread at the bottom layer when the droplet dispensed on the top has a momentum andor capillary pressure exceeding the capillary resistance of the hydrophobic porous material the hydrohead chatterjee et al 2018 a droplet impacting on a porous substrate with a velocity u will penetrate the substrate if its dynamic pressure pdu2 exceeds the resisting capillary pressure  cos advdpore where  denotes the liquid density  1000 kgm3  the liquid surface tension 007 nm for water and dpore the equivalent pore diameter  100 m for the polypropylene bag materials see fig 1a1 the penetration velocity of  cos advdpore  068 ms typical droplet velocity close to the mouth during sneezing and coughing which exceeds  6 ms nishimura et al 2013 implies that when a person wearing this mask sneezes droplets penetrate the innermost polypropylene layer and get absorbed in the intermediate layer further penetration through the intermediate layer is prevented due to the immediate wicking action of the hydrophilic cellulosic material moreover the combination of the hydrophilic intermediate layer followed by the hydrophobic outermost one behaves in the non-penetrative direction of the liquid diode mates et al 2014 chatterjee et al 2018 thus preventing escape of droplets to the ambient around the wearer the same physics also prevents back-flow of the soaked liquid from the intermediate layer to the innermost polypropylene layer thus keeping the contact surface next to the skin dry and ensuring human comfort and hygiene any droplet suspended in the ambient has a possibility of impinging on the outermost hydrophobic layer during inhaling phase however these droplets will in general be arrested on the hydrophobic layer since the droplet velocities will be below the prerequisite penetration velocityonce the three-layer fabric assembly has been prepared by stitching them together the mask can be made following any suitable mask-making template available online we have used one method to make a prototype fig 2 using a common sewing machine in the absence of a sewing machine the mask can be hand-stitched as well care has been taken while adopting the correct template so that the mask has the best possible conformity to the face and the leakage through gaps between the mask and the skin is minimal the students group has played a key role in executing the quick fabrication the group has also prepared videos httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtboqofeaooct127s2020 to disseminate the procedure among all people on one hand any organization can take up the procedure to make it and supply in large numbers on the other hand any person can make it for hisher own protection feedbacks from the individual users have also been positive so far for a dynamically updated feedback summary see httpswwwdropboxcoms8z1mnbyy5hfdyb7user20feedbackpdfdl0reckoning the raw material cost at the retail market and labor costs the production cost of the mask was estimated to be rs 456 per piece which can go down by about 50 if the masks are made in large quantities it is important to note that several improvements in the layout of the mask design and the template is possible see the electronic supplementary information figure r1 for another design which is left as a future exercise the technology has already been picked up by msme entities with minor modifications in the physical layout for mass production httpswwwsulekhainkcoin product brochure 2020 page 5the technical specifications of the readily available fabric layers were not available the porosity and the liquid spreading coefficients of gamcha are not reported and could not be measured sans the access to the university laboratory facilities due to the nationwide lockdown therefore the most important part of the development was testing the three-layer fabric for a near-real-life situation a quick in-house experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the mask in arresting the droplets generated from sneezing of the person wearing a mask see fig 3a a finely-divided spray photograph in fig 3a of water droplets was impacted from close proximity  50 mm on the innermost polypropylene layer each puff from the hand-sprayer dispensed  112 l of water this is comparable with the typical volume  75 l of fluid ejected in a single cough sze to et al 2009 zhang 2017 any trace of penetration from the outermost polypropylene layer was visually inspected by holding the mask against a mirror-finish surface during the spray and checking the mirror surface and the outer surface of the mask for traces of liquid after the spray-test the sprinkled water droplets were found to cross the innermost polypropylene layer keeping its exposed to the skin surface dry the middle cotton layer was found after spraying dyed water and then cutting open the mask to retain the liquid droplets by wicking shown by the spread of dyed water in fig 3b no noticeable trace of moisture on the mirror-finish test plate was observed on the outermost side fig 3c even after 30 puffs of spray ie 36 ml of liquid indicating that the second polypropylene layer prevented droplet transmission to its outer exposed surface droplet prevention in the reverse flow was also arrested by this design when a finely divided mist was released on the outermost polypropylene layerthis time not with high impact since they emulate droplets suspended in ambient airthe droplets could not penetrate the hydrophobic outer layer the momentum of the droplets in this case could not overcome the capillary pressure needed to transport through the pores of the polypropylene layer thus they stayed on the outermost surface and eventually evaporatedhence the mask is also expected to prevent ingress of airborne liquid droplets during inhalation the performance of the mask did not degrade even after multiple up to 5 times washing cycles it was also verified that a person could breathe comfortably after wearing this mask further quantitative experimentation eg pressure drop across the mask layers can be carried out once the university laboratories become accessible again a comparison was also made with a common triple-layer surgical mask available in the market figure 3d shows the result of spray penetration test where traces of moisture were found on the mirror surface as well as on the exterior of the mask under similar conditions of testing indicating that the three-layer surgical mask failed to prevent droplet penetration upon 30 puffs of spraya low-cost diy face mask has been prepared using three layers of porous fabric where a hydrophilic cellulosic intermediate layer is sandwiched between two moderately hydrophobic layers of non-woven commercially-available polypropylene the combination of the innermost and the middle layer allow high-momentum droplets to penetrate the hydrophobic layer and get absorbed on the hydrophilic layer while the outermost hydrophobic layer prevents any escape of droplets to the surroundings of the wearer reverse flow from the outside through the outermost polypropylene layer or from the middle layer to the innermost layer is also prevented simple test using a garden sprayer shows the ability of the mask in restricting through transmission of the droplets either outbound during a sneeze or cough or during inhalingcovid-19 coronavirus has spread dramatically over the entire globe affecting all health-care systems 29 30 in most countries around europe a discussion has started on how to optimally protect health-care workers 1214 16 there is a variety of different recommendations for health-care worker protection given by each country or hospital however there are to date no clear recommendations for personal protective equipment ppe and safety recommendations in the surgical field such as orthopaedics and traumatologythe recommendations should lead to an optimal protection and safety of all health-care workers a covid-19 infection of just one health-care worker can have a dramatic effect for the health care itself it is known that the average person infected with covid-19 is likely to infect 15 to 35 others 4 a single covid-19 infection among essential health-care workers at a hospital might severely reduce the capacity of an entire hospital 14 in wuhan the outbreak region around 1300 health-care workers became infected 24 in italy to date over 100 physicians have died of the disease 14 the likelihood of becoming infected for health-care workers is more than three times as high as the general populationthere is general consensus that all health-care workers should wear regular surgical masks and gloves for all patient interactions in addition avoiding unnecessary contact keeping adequate distance proper hand hygiene and disinfection is indicated in most hospitals positive or suspicious for covid-19 patients are separated from non-infected patients handling of covid-19-negative patients is difficult because many covid-19 patients are asymptomatic the availability of screening tests is often limited and they have a high rate of false-negative findings 23there is an uncertainty regarding the optimal ppe for different tasks in our daily work there is general agreement that respiratory masks should be used for aerosol-generating procedures agps however there has been confusion regarding the definition of agps in orthopaedic surgery and traumatology in fact recommendations for ppe have been influenced by the availability of adequate masks gloves gowns helmets and goggles rather than the science for their usealthough elective surgery might have been postponed in some countries trauma and orthopaedics is at the frontline with coronavirus because emergency orthopaedic operations are still amongst the most common emergency surgical procedures many orthopaedic surgeons do not know what is safe to wear and recommended with increasing numbers of fatalities among doctors we aimed to raise awareness of the issues surrounding ppe by reviewing current evidence and recommendations for ppe in orthopaedic surgery and traumatologyone author extracted data from all the selected original articles which was repeated by two other authors if there was no agreement between the three the senior author was consulted where required the corresponding authors were contacted for additional information data were extracted from each included article and entered into a spreadsheet for analysis pertinent information extracted included author date and journal of publication study design and level of evidence and patient demographics mean age mean follow-up total and groups number of patients outcomefour studies were found which deal with the question of aerosol generation during surgeryin the landmark article by nogler et al which was published in 2001 the authors performed three laminectomies c4c6 in cadavers using a high-speed 06-mm ball cutter 25 they investigated the environmental and body contamination through contaminated aerosols generated by this high-speed cutter the irrigation solution was marked with staphylococcusaureus and after surgery used for tracing of aerosol contamination the authors found a contamination at an area of 5  7 m around the operating field and everyone in the room showed face and body contamination the surgeon and the surgical assistant showed a more severe contamination than other or staff 25in another cadaver study with a similar setup by nogler et al the authors investigated environmental and body contamination by an ultrasound device and a high-speed cutter in the revision of cemented total hip arthroplasty 26 the authors found an environmental contamination of 6  8 m both the ultrasound and the high-speed cutter contaminated all members of the surgical team consisting of an anaesthesiologist a surgeon a surgical assistant and a scrub nurse 26heinsohn et al investigated the exposure of operating room or personnel to blood aerosols and found that the upper respiratory tract was exposed to aerosolized blood in the operating room 15jewett et al assessed whether different surgical power tools such as bone saws and bone drills or electrocautery in cutting and coagulation mode lead to aerosol generation in an or setting 18 all of the tools tested led to blood-containing aerosol particles  5 maerosol-generating procedures should be defined as respiratory or surgical respiratory agps such as intubation are a high risk of transmitting respiratory virus infections such as covid-19 surgical agps such as the use of high-speed power tools are a high risk of transmitting virus particles in body fluids and pieces of body tissue covid-19 is known to be present in all body fluidsa narrative review by wong et al highlighted the fact that based on current evidence aerosols might be generated during use of high-speed orthopaedic power tools 34 they concluded that every person present during surgery should wear ppe including surgical gloves a water-resistant surgical gown with long sleeves a surgical mask and full-face protection with a face shield 34 in cases of possible airborne transmitted diseases such as covid-19 additional respiratory ppe should be used in addition they recommended to avoid use of electrocautery and power tools and to use wound irrigation with bulb syringes instead of pulsed irrigation jet lavage 34sterile surgical gowns are part of the standard protection in the or in every surgery the or team consisting of the surgeon the surgical assistants and the scrub nurse wear sterile surgical gowns to reduce intraoperative wound contamination and to minimize the patients infection risk it is also a personal protection against blood and body fluids which are often sprayed in an area of 38 m around the operating table 25 26different types of surgical gowns offer different degrees of barrier protection to surgeons the american society for testing and materials astm f2407 is an umbrella document which describes testing for surgical gowns tear resistance seam strength lint generation evaporative resistance and water vapour transmission 3the critical zone of a surgical gown comprises the front area of the gown from chest to knees and the sleeves from the cuff to above the elbow the safety levels of gowns for medical use can be classified in levels 14 3 level 1 gowns should be used in minimal risk environment such as basic care or for visitors 3 level 2 gowns should be used in low-risk procedures such as venous blood draw 3 level 3 gowns are generally used for moderate-risk procedures such as arterial blood draw or in the er 3 level 4 gowns are preserved for high-risk procedures such as surgery or when infectious diseases are suspected 3helmets or togas might also be an option for protection against body spray but only protect against airborne transmission of covid-19 in combination with respirator masksgenerally there are three different types of disposable masks available single-use face masks surgical masks and respiratory maskssingle-use face masks which are typically thin and consist of only one layer are only capable of filtering rather larger particles 3 m surgical masks are generally more effective than single-use face masks in filtering virus-sized particles a medical or surgical mask may be sufficient to prevent droplet transfer while a respirator mask is required for airborne infection however the exact filtration characteristics of surgical masks are rather variable and depend on the layers usedmost of the health-care workers currently use surgical masks to protect themselves against pathogens spread by droplet transmission such as covid-19 although it is well established that these provide insufficient protection against airborne transmission there is conflicting evidence from a systematic review by leung et al which found that surgical masks can efficaciously reduce coronavirus detection and viral copies in large respiratory droplets and in aerosols 21 however this only suggests that it could be used by covid-19-positive patients to limit further covid-19 transmission clearly this study has no relevance for or staff protection 21the general consensus among surgeons is that conventional surgical masks do not offer protection against high-risk agps multiple surgical masks also fail to filter virus loaded particles they should not be used as a substitute for respirator masks unless there is no alternative and the compromise for a lower level protection is made due to lack of availability 2 13 14for protection against airborne transmission air-purifying respirator masks should be used respirator masks generally filter more smaller sized particles 03 m than surgical masks the european standard en 1492001 classifies respirator masks into three different categories filtering facepiece 1 ffp1 ffp2 and ffp3 ffp2 is comparable to us standard n95 20 the filtration effectiveness of different masks is presented in table 3in comparison to surgical masks respirator masks show protection factors 115159 times greater than those of surgical masks 20 in addition to the type of masks used the fitting and sizing of the mask is of utmost importance only a perfect-sized and well-fitted mask leads to efficient sealing of the respiratory tract intact masks can be worn for up to 8 h continuously 20powered air-purifying respirators 11 were mainly used during the sars outbreak for health-care personnel involved in high-risk invasive procedures or agps these respirators in the form of a hood or a full-face mask consist of a motor-driven fan guiding the possibly contaminated air towards a filter which then actively filters it and finally delivers the clean air to the users face andor moutha recent systematic review of four randomised controlled trials by bartoszko et al compared medical masks to n95 respirator masks in their efficacy to prevent coronavirus in health-care workers 7 the authors found and concluded that low certainty evidence exists that medical masks and n95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in health-care workers during non-aerosol-generating care 7eye protection is critical for orthopaedic surgeons as many procedures such as the use of power tools frequently lead to contamination of every or personnel in the room and surface contamination in the or in an area of up to 6 maround the operating table 25 26in addition a splash injury to the eye region although less frequent than in the mouth and nose region is a common event in surgeries such as total hip and knee arthroplasties mainly affecting the operating surgeon and the assistant 1 therefore orthopaedic surgeons must protect themselves from conjunctival contaminationin a prospective study of conjunctival contamination during common orthopaedic operations 43 65 of 66 goggles worn by surgeons were contaminated the contamination rate of the protective flaps at the sides of the goggles was relatively low 5 suggesting that ordinary spectacles which are more convenient and comfortable than standard goggles provide adequate protection during routine use 9 10 however in an in vitro study aiming to compare the effectiveness of various types of protective eyewear in preventing conjunctival contamination during a femoral osteotomy disposable plastic glasses were found to be associated with the lowest rate of conjunctival contamination 3 and the authors recommended that eye protective devices should provide protection above and below the eye as well as contoured side protection to minimize the risk of contamination 22 modern prescription glasses provided no more benefit than the use of no eye protection so that they should not be used as sole eye protection during surgical proceduresalthough there is no evidence to date it is considered possible that sars-cov-2 is transmitted to the conjunctiva by aerosol preventive measures should thus include the systematic wear of goggles covering the eyes and the periocular skin for all health-care workers present in the room during potentially infectious aerosol-generating proceduresmost patient care activities require the use of a single pair of nonsterile gloves made of either latex nitrile or vinyl sterile gloves are considered as standard protection in the or as they reduce the risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens for most orthopaedic surgeries double gloving is recommendedin orthopaedics and traumatology surgeries surgical glove perforations have been reported to occur in 185 of conventional and 58 of arthroscopic procedures they were more often seen in emergency surgeries compared to elective surgeries and mainly concerned the principal surgeon 19 also more glove perforations occur during operations on bone compared with soft tissue operations 31the risk of contamination from blood is known to be 13 times higher when using single compared with double gloves so that the use of double gloving is a recommended practice 19 exposure of surgeons to blood could indeed be reduced from 54 to 10 by double gloving 31 finally to reduce the risk of contamination and perforation 8 increasing the number of outer glove renewals during certain stages of total hip arthroplasty implantation such as prosthesis reduction surgical incision or femoral cementing is also recommended 31limited data have shown that viral rna could be detected in blood samples and it is not yet clear whether blood transmission of sars-cov-2 is possible preventive measures should include double gloving with outer glove renewals during at-risk procedurestelemedicine has been recognized as an efficient tool for providing electronic personal protective equipment eppe to health-care workers 32 it might help to protect staff and save ppe while providing rapid access to emergency care in orthopaedics under certain circumstances the service can be provided with limited direct physical patient contact in most orthopaedic centres around the world outpatient work had to be reduced or postponed due to covid-19 crisis only patients with urgent orthopaedic conditions are seen face to face under ppe conditions consequently video or telephone consultations are considered or done for many orthopaedic patientsto date there is only a paucity of studies dealing with the impact of telemedicine in orthopaedics prada et al presented a tele-orthopaedic strategy and evaluated its efficiency and impact on waiting times for orthopaedic specialty consultations in a rural hospital in chile 27 the authors found that of 89 patients referred to the orthopaedic surgeon by telemedicine 697 required one or more follow-ups through tele-orthopaedic service and 303 were referred for on-site assessment by the orthopaedic surgeon 27 the waiting times of the referrals decreased on average from 201 to 40 days 27the authors concluded that by the use of telemedicine it was possible to significantly reduce waiting list times and optimize travel times and expenditures 27 in health-care crisis in which health-care resources are limited or restrictions for seeing patients in outpatient seeing are put in place telemedicine might be a valuable option to protect health-care personnel against disease transmission and still provide sufficient service to a considerable number of orthopaedic patients however the authors also highlighted the fact that when using videoconferencing as a mode of consultation the orthopaedic surgeon and traumatologist need to have specific physical examination skills as a manual examination is not possible 27during the current covid-19 crisis many orthopaedic surgeons have been forced to explore different methods other than face-to-face consultations which is the conventional way for initial contact with the patient or clinical follow-ups video- or telephone consultations are increasingly recognized in these times due to regulatory restrictions but also as many patients try to avoid showing up for a follow-up in hospital or the outpatient environment because they are afraid of nosocomial infections it has also been shown that the use of telemedicine for the first consultation to an orthopaedics oncology service is highly cost-efficient as it leads to a decrease in health-care cost between 122 and 72 5the deaths of doctors during the covid-19 pandemic may simply be a result of having been exposed in their work to people infected with the disease whilst the general population has been in lockdown 4 if this is borne out by the evidence then sadly this could have been avoided by providing full ppe as used in countries such as china and south korea secondly high viral load exposure has been linked with a more severe disease 6 this may also have been avoided by providing full ppe for all patient contact regardless of their infection statusorthopaedic and trauma surgery are the most common type of surgery in the emergency setting the present literature review of the published evidence for ppe during orthopaedic surgery in a covid-19 environment has highlighted the need for raised awareness of the types of ppe available for the surgical team when they should be used and the definition of surgical agps interestingly the who guidance on ppe for covid-19 omitted the operating room whereas uk nhs guidance evolved during the first few weeks of the uk lockdown 28 33 uk authorities eventually recognized surgery with high-speed devices as an agp respiratory agps require ffp3 masks or powered air-purifying respirators whereas surgical agps only require ffp2 masks 28 another option would be powered air-purifying respirators veterinary surgeons protect their surgical team from aerosilised herpes virus particles using powered air-purifying respirators such as the 3 m versaflo system with hepa filter and an s533 cape 17it is widely accepted that covid-19 virus is transmitted via droplets from the respiratory system of infected patients however the virus is also found in the blood and other bodily fluids the clinical significance of non-respiratory tract viral transmission is unclear the prevalence and importance of viral loads in the different fluids are widely unknownbony surgery around the head and neck ent neurosurgery and ophthalmic surgery generates aerosols from the respiratory tract and exposes the surgeon to high viral levels orthopaedic surgery particularly to the lower limb produces vast amounts of aerosols including blood fine bone particles synovial fluid and saline from the irrigation when high-speed power tools are used table 1the use of power tools is fundamental to osteotomies joint arthroplasty and trauma surgery where reaming sawing and drilling are needed for bone preparation saline irrigation is necessary to reduce local tissue thermal damage but can significantly add to aerosol generationelectrocautery generates smoke plumes which contain bio-aerosols with viable and non-viable cellular material that subsequently poses a risk of infection human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis b virus human papillomavirus and causes irritation to the lungs 2 covid-19 is an rna virus however transmission via this route is not known table 2european and us respiratory masks are classified into three protection classes european respiratory masks and filtering face piece ffp are classified on their assigned protection factor and provide a level of protection to the user based on the concentration of the occupation exposure limit oel figs 1 2ffp1 reduces oel by a factor of 4 ffp2 by a factor of 10 and ffp3 by a factor of 20in the usa the respiratory mask protection classification is based upon the percentage of filtration of very small particles 03 m they are classified into n95 n99 and n100 masks the n95 mask blocks 95 of particles the n99 blocks 99 and the n100 blocks 9997 table 3 the european ffp1 does not offer protection against covid-19 the european ffp3 equivalent to the us n99 is recommended for aerosol protection against covid-19 figs 3 4with this review it was found that different surgical power tools such as saws or burrs as well as electrocautery in cutting and coagulation mode lead to aerosol generation in the or according to the current knowledge which is based on deductions from previous literature findings rather than specifically oriented research aerosol generation puts the health-care workers at high risk for covid-19 disease transmission hence the recommended ppe for orthopaedic surgeons should consist of level 4 surgical gowns face shields or googles and double gloves in case of proven or suspected covid-19 infection orthopaedic surgeons should use ffp2-3 or n95-99 respirator masks table 4there is a number of limitations to be acknowledged with regard to the present review and ppe recommendations there is currently ongoing change in evidence about ppe hence this review is not meant to be a guideline moreover it aims to describe ppe in particular for orthopaedic surgeons and discuss the relevant clinical evidence a systematic review was not possible due to the heterogeneity of available informationthe covid-19 crisis has alerted us to review current practice and evidence of personal protective equipment for orthopaedic and trauma surgeons during orthopaedic and trauma procedures such as the use of power tools burrs or electrocautery potentially infective aerosol is generated the major aim of our efforts should be to avoid an occupational transmission of covid-19 by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate personal protective equipment should be available and used during surgery in addition efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regardcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which is closely related to bat sars related coronaviruses1 is the second pandemic of the 21st century following the influenza a h1n1 pandemic of 2009 with the rapidly galloping epidemic due to globalization and international travel world health organization who declared covid-19 to be a pandemic on 11 march 20202 which is 72 days after the first official announcement of clusters of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in wuhan hubei province of china on 31 december 2019 day 13 as of 8 april 2020 day 100 over 135 million people have been infected worldwide with nearly 80000 deaths4 in response proactive infection control measures have been implemented in hospital settings5

6 in addition non-pharmaceutical public health interventions including border control or closure quarantine and testing of all incoming travelers or returnees massive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing for case detection rapid contact tracing and quarantine frequent hand hygiene and later social distancing measures including school closure home office cancelation of all mass gatherings later stay-at-home order and cessation of all socioeconomic activities except essential services were also adopted to various degrees and at different time points in different geographical areas to reduce the risk of community transmission many of these measures had been used for the control of community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and pandemic influenza a h1n1 in 2009 in hong kong special administrative region of china hksar and other parts of the world7

8 however the efficacy of community-wide masking of the population during these past epidemics or the present covid-19 pandemic has not been clearly investigated unlike 2003 sars which was generally manifested with high fever and progressive pneumonia with a mortality of about 10 covid-19 can be associated with very mild symptoms and a mortality of less than 4 thus subclinical or asymptomatic sars-cov-2 shedders may play an important role in perpetuating the pandemic9

10 we hypothesized that community-wide masking in hksar may break the chain of transmission of sars-cov-2 by reducing the infectiousness of the subclinical virus shedders while also offering some protection to the susceptible populationin hksar community-wide masking was practiced by the general population at an early stage of the local covid-19 epidemic here we described the comparative epidemiology of covid-19 during the first 100 days we also analyzed the incidence of covid-19 in geographical areas with or without community-wide masking for most individuals and also the number of covid-19 clusters of covid-19 in relation to workplace mask-on setting or non-workplace recreational settings mask-off setting of hksarhksar is a cosmopolitan city of 745 million people in southern china occupying only 1104 square-kilometers it is the third most densely populated area in the world with around 6700 people per square-kilometer soon after the official announcement of a cluster of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in wuhan by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china on 31 december 2019 day 1 the center for health protection chp of the department of health the hksar government alerted members of the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene with specific emphasis on hand hygiene refraining from work or attending class at school avoiding crowded places seek medical advice promptly and wear a surgical mask if they develop respiratory symptoms3 step-wise introduction of other community interventions later to control the spread of covid-19 was described as an objective parameter of community-wide preparedness compliance of face mask usage by the general public monitored by staff working in infection control unit and department of microbiology queen mary hospital for three consecutive days from 6 april to 8 april 2020 day 98 to day 100 each staff member would count the number of persons not wearing a mask among the first 50 persons encountered in the street during their morning commute the residential district of the staff was recordeda multi-pronged screening strategy to identify patients infected with sars-cov-2 was implemented5

6 the epidemiology of newly confirmed cases was announced in the daily press conference jointly held by chp and hospital authority major clusters arising from mask-on workplace and mask-off recreational settings were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of wearing face masksthe epidemiology of covid-19 of hksar was compared to that of the representative countries in north america europe and asia using publicly accessible information from the website of who to understand the overall effect of our control measures used in hksar countries with well-established healthcare system where face mask usage was not universally adopted in the community and having over 100 confirmed cases at day 72 when who declared a pandemic were selected for comparisonclinical specimens including nasopharyngeal aspirates nasopharyngeal swabs throat swab saliva sputum endotracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage were subjected to nucleic acid extraction by the emag extraction system biomrieux marcy-ltoile france as we previously described5

6 the presence of sars-cov-2 rna in specimens was first determined by the lightmix modular sebeccov e-gene commercial kit tib molbiol berlin germany at all public hospitals under the hospital authority and the public health laboratory service of the department of health and further confirmed by in-house real-time rt-pcr assay targeting the sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerasehelicase gene as described11
incidence rates were compared using the exact poisson test using r software proportions were compared using the chi-squared test a p value of 005 was considered statistically significantdue to the prior experience of the sars outbreak in 2003 the general public of hksar was on high alert after the official announcement of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology in wuhan on 31 december 2019 day 1 because a total of 1755 infected persons with 299 170 deaths over 133 days 11 february 2003 to 23 june 2003 was recorded during this past sars epidemic when the causative agent of covid-19 was identified on 9 january 2020 day 10 and named as sars-cov-2 on 12 february 2020 day 44 this emerging pathogen was perceived to be as detrimental as 2003 sars-cov by the hksar general public even though initially hksar government only advocated people with respiratory symptoms to wear a surgical mask according to the recommendations of who and centers for disease control and prevention cdc of the united states the general public volunteered to wear face mask quite compliantly from the pre-pandemic to pandemic phase of covid-19sixty-seven staff members 9 from infection control unit and 58 from department of microbiology residing in all 18 administrative districts in hksar recorded the number of persons not wearing face mask among the first 50 people they encountered during their morning commute to queen mary hospital located in southern district between 700am to 900am over three consecutive days from 6 april to 8 april 2020 day 98 to day 100 a total of 10050 persons were observed only 337 34 persons did not wear face mask the daily compliance of face mask usage was 972 971 and 957 over three consecutive days in all 18 administrative districts in hksarbesides proactive infection control measures implemented by public hospitals under the governance of hospital authority5

6 step-wise introduction of epidemiological measures by the hksar government were enforced they included border controls to reduce imported sars-cov-2 cases from mainland china on 4 february 2020 day 36 this was followed by imposing home quarantine order for 14 days to all entrees from mainland china on 8 february 2020 day 40 subsequently the quarantine order was progressively imposed to all entrees into hksar on and after 19 march 2020 day 80 fig 1
 all entrees were compulsorily tested for sars-cov-2 by collecting their posterior oropharyngeal saliva with effect from 8 april 2020 day 100 as in other localities isolation of confirmed case contact tracing and quarantine closure of affected or high risk premises and social distancing measures such as home-office and school closure were institutedup to day 100 of the epidemic a total of 961 cases of covid-19 were confirmed in hksar transmission of covid-19 was divisible into four phases phase 0 from day 1 to 21 with no confirmed cases of covid-19 in hksar phase 1 from day 22 to 30 with 10 imported cases phase 2 from day 31 to 71 with 111 cases predominantly local cases and phase 3 from day 72 who declared covid-19 pandemic onwards with 840 cases predominantly imported cases with local clusters of cases fig 1 among the 961 confirmed cases there were 11 clusters of 113 persons that were directly engaged in mask-off activities such as dining and drinking in restaurant or bar singing at karaoke and exercise in fitness clubs there were only three clusters involving 11 persons engaged in mask-on settings at the workplace using the chi-square test of goodness-of-fit with williams continuity correction there were significantly more covid-19 clusters involving mask-off settings than might be expected assuming that the null hypothesis of equal number of clusters involving mask-on and mask-off settings was true p  0036the incidence and cumulative number of covid-19 cases in hksar and the representative countries or areas since the first laboratory-confirmed case of sars-cov-2 are illustrated in fig 2a
 2b
 the incidence of covid-19 in hksar was significantly less than that of the selected countries with well-established healthcare system and having over 100 confirmed cases at day 72 when who declared a pandemic in asia europe and north america where face mask usage was not universally adopted in the community table 1
 singapores land area and population density are comparable to hksar4 on day 100 8 april 2020 the incidence of covid-19 per million population in singapore was significantly higher than that in hksar 2598 per million population vs 1290 per million population p 0001 table 2
 in south korea the number of molecular diagnostic tests per million population was comparable to hksar the proportion of local cases in south korea related to mask-off settings was significantly higher than that in hksar 515010384 496 vs 113  961 118 p0001 because of super-spreading events at a church which was also a mask-off setting table 2evidence for using face masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses in the community remains limited to a few studies conducted in the household setting12

13 although there is no expert consensus on this issue universal masking is voluntarily adopted by people in our hksar community soon after the first imported case of covid-19 was reported this public action was linked to the painful experience of the 2003 sars outbreak 1755 cases with 299 deaths in 673 million population when hksar people adopted universal masking in addition to other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand hygiene social distancing and school closure7 these community hygienic measures during the sars outbreak resulted in a significant reduction of positive specimens of all circulating respiratory viruses including influenza viruses in 2003 compared with preceding periods14 in a case-control study conducted in beijing during 2003 sars consistent wearing of a face mask outdoors was associated with a 70 risk reduction compared to those not wearing a face mask15
hksar is the only area practicing universal masking despite the recommendation of who and cdc that mask should be reserved for those with symptoms and in healthcare settings we therefore compared the number of covid-19 clusters in mask-on settings at workplace with that of the mask-off settings such as dining and drinking in restaurant or bar singing at karaoke and exercising in gymnasium where there was a large gathering of people sharing food drinks and instruments in effect these mask-off settings allowed the sharing of their saliva and respiratory droplets which may contain a viral load of 100 million per ml directly or indirectly16

17 in hksar hospitals wearing face masks is mandatory during the pandemic it is also the practice among many community service providers and those who are working indoors since the supply of face mask was tight in the community as well as in the healthcare setting it is the practice of our general public not to use more than one face mask per person per day we observed that the overall compliance of face mask usage was 97 in all administrative districts in the morning thus we have the reason to believe that their compliance to face mask usage would remain high throughout the day at the workplace it is therefore not surprising that the number of covid-19 clusters was significantly higher in the mask-off recreational settings in hksaruniversal masking in the community may mitigate the extent of transmission of covid-19 and may be a necessary adjunctive public health measure in a densely populated city like hksar with an average of 170000 people entering hksar from mainland and overseas per day18 our incidence of covid-19 was also lower than that of other areas with local transmission vindicating this approach in particular our incidence of covid-19 was significantly lower than that of singapore a city comparable with hksar in terms of area population density healthcare infrastructure bcg vaccination19 as well as adopting social distancing strategies and sars-cov-2 testing infrastructure20 besides a lower ambient temperature and a higher risk of importation of covid-19 cases from the mainland which are factors promoting covid-19 transmission in hksar the most important difference between the two cities is the community-wide usage of face masks in hksar but not in singapore moreover 50 of local transmission of covid-19 in south korea was attributed to religious activities where face mask usage was discouraged mask-off activities clearly have potential implications for covid-19 transmission in the communityhowever the use of face mask in the community remains controversial21

22 who issued an interim guideline regarding the use of masks in the context of covid-19 on 6 april 2020 stating no evidence that wearing a mask by healthy persons in the wider community setting can prevent acquisition of covid-1923 european centre for disease prevention and control issued a technical report on 8 april 2020 that the use of face masks in the community could be considered especially when visiting busy closed spaces despite not knowing how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other counter measures24 on 3 april 2020 cdc recommended the use of cloth face coverings especially in areas of significant community-based transmission25 the shift of paradigm from not recommending to promoting the use of face masks was based on the rationale of pre-symptomatic shedding of sars-cov-2 and presence of asymptomatic patients with high viral load in the community9

26 the use of face mask may serve as source control by preventing dispersal of droplets during talking sneezing and coughing27 and also reduce the risk of environmental contamination by sars-cov-2 despite some supporters of who recommendation speaking against universal masking in our local medical community most opinion leaders in the clinical microbiology and infectious disease specialties of hksar openly championed this measure for the control of community transmission of covid-1928 masking is a continuous form of protection to stop the spreading of saliva and respiratory droplets to others or from others and to the environment or from the environment to the susceptible by hands through touching of nose mouth and eye touching nose and mouth is a subconscious behavior29 hand hygiene is always the cornerstone to prevent transmission of covid-19 but it is a one-off discontinuous process where hand contamination may occur easily between each alcoholic handrubbing or hand washing although we have successfully implemented directly observed hand hygiene dohh by regular delivery of alcohol-based hand rub to conscious hospitalized patients and persons in residential care homes for the elderly before meal and medication rounds30 31 32 it may be difficult to practice dohh in the community studies have also shown that wearing a mask with frequent hand hygiene significantly reduced transmission of seasonal influenza virus in the community setting but once the effect of the use of surgical mask was removed the effect of hand hygiene became insignificant33 with the understanding that the supply of face masks should primarily be reserved for usage in healthcare settings we believe that it is still advisable to encourage people to wear face masks in the public based on the precautionary principles34 moreover wearing a cloth mask with less filtration efficiency may still be better than no mask at all in communities of high transmissionsars-cov-2 is a highly transmissible respiratory virus which causes upper and lower respiratory tract infection leading to a high viral load in respiratory secretions and saliva as shown in clinical studies and transmission studies by close contact in animal models35 moreover sars-cov-2 can suppress the host innate immune response in terms of interferon and cytokine response which in turn leads to a higher level of viral replication than that by the 2003 sars-cov in an ex vivo lung tissue explant model10 these ex vivo findings supported the suggestion that an important proportion of covid-19 patients may be pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic virus shedders these groups of patients are unlikely to be tested or isolated and may contribute to the perpetuation of the pandemic therefore community-wide mask usage irrespective of symptoms may reduce the infectivity of these silent covid-19 cases to the susceptible individualsthere are several limitations in our study first we did not analyze the mask-off settings in the family because the modes of transmission among close household contacts can be more diverse if the 15 family clusters were also counted within the mask-off settings the difference would be even more significant p0001 second the type of mask used in the community cannot be controlled the compliance of wearing face mask in terms of not touching the external surface of mask or face and hand hygiene before or after touching the mask cannot be assessed third we cannot count the mask compliance directly for every community settings nevertheless in the absence of effective antiviral and vaccines the pandemic spread covid-19 to many countries provide an unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of this non-pharmaceutical control measures as of 27 february 2020 day 38 since the first reported case in south korea south korea government has started to distribute face masks to the public amid the outbreak of the covid-1936 which was associated with a flattening of the epidemic curve as of 14 april 2020 day 82 since the first reported case in singapore singapore government has started to enforce a penalty of 300 singapore dollar for anyone going out from home without a mask37 further studies on this important non-pharmaceutical control measure are warranted in order to live with emerging infectious diseases and seasonal influenza epidemics every individual should have personalized reusable mask gown and gloves made of self-disinfecting fabrics and even reusable anti-fog face shield within their own set of epidemic

holidays chinese people have the traditional habit of traveling to their hometowns for a family reunion and gathering to celebrate the beginning of the lunar new year hence many people including groups of macao citizens were obligated to stay in hubei province after the announcement of lockdownsanitary cordons by the local government on 23 january 2020 that is 2 days before chinese new year it was not until 7 march 2020 that the macao sar government escorted a special team to wuhan china to pick up 57 macao citizens from 31 families who stayed in 10 different cities in hubei province macao sar government portal 2020b covid-19 was ruled out in all of them afterwardsa cross-sectional survey was conducted to have in-depth questionnaire interview of these people who were all uninfected by sars-cov-2 in a high-risk area hubei province china this study aims to identify the common grounds and personal behavior leading to a zero-infection rate among participants that might provide crucial hints on global covid-19 pandemic controla citizen who presented with body temperature equal to or greater than 375 degree celsius in hubei province was not allowed for boarding after arrival to macao all 57 citizens were sent to public health clinical center for a 14-day quarantine a total of three serial nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained on day 2 day 7 and day 13 for viral rna detection by real-time rt-pcr techniques which were all negative 100 macao sar government portal 2020a sera antibodies of sar-cov-2 were tested with all negative results 100 on day 14 before citizens released from quarantine all citizens did not complain any symptoms during quarantine period a questionnaire was designed to obtain demographic information activity in hubei province contact history personal health behaviors such as habit of handwashing mask usage and home cleaning participants aged 15 or over were eligible for this study the questionnaire survey was delivered to the isolation ward and was implemented by self-administration the written consents were collected as digital formatinfants and children with age under fifteen were considered ineligible for this survey this study was approved by the hospital medical ethical committee of centro hospitalar conde de so janurio macao sar chinadescriptive statistic was used to summarize demographic information high-risk activities and common preventive measures via standard parameter such as percentage mean and median then we compared behavior changes before and during covid-19 outbreak using wilcoxon signed rank test in continuous variables or mcnemar test in dichotomized variables the statistical significance level was determined at   005 the statistical analysis was conducted using r version 352 r core team 2018a total of 42 effective questionnaires were analyzed in final after exclusion of 14 infants and children with age less than 15 years old and missing of one questionnaire response rate 977 the demographic information was summarized in table 1 the majority of the participants aged between 20 and 44 years old 524 and had received secondary education or above 976 the proportion of female composed more than 70 of this group of returners the most common comorbid diseases were hypertension 71 followed by diabetes mellitus 48 and hepatitis 48 more than half of the respondents were non-smokers 619 the main reason for visit hubei is to visit relatives 881 more than 85 percent of participants thought the most important reason of not getting covid-19 was to keep distance stay away from the crowd and decrease cluster or gathering incidence followed by good personal protective measures 738mobility and participation of high-risk activities were restricted for these participants in hubei province according to the emergency response policy and these were specified by these respondents table 2 976 of them did not visit crowded places 905 of them did not use any public transportation 905 did not go to any supermarket about three-quarters of respondents received daily supply at home via unified delivery none of them visited or traveled to other provinces or cities 0 all the participants 100 denied any contact with suspected or confirmed covid-19 patients while 48 of the participants stated there was confirmed covid-19 cases in their local communitya further survey of comparison of personal preventive measures before and during disease outbreak showed increased alert and practice of personal protection and hygiene during the spread table 3 such as wearing

significant and may possibly reflect the effectiveness of public health interventionsthe aims of this research was to investigate the reasons that contributed to the negativeness of covid-19 in this high-risk population in hubei province on the one hand good physical health could be one factor as the majority of participants were below the age of 45 619 non-smokers 61 and 857 had no underlying chronic diseases however further studies are needed to determine the exact effect of physical health on the risk of covid-19 infection on the other hand it was also important to stop the transmission chain via political measures or personal health behaviorson 23 january 2020 2 days before the chinese new year the china government imposed a lockdown in wuhan and other cities in hubei to quarantine this center which is commonly referred to as the wuhan lockdown health-commission 2020 all public transport including buses railways flights and ferry services were suspended with all stations and airports closed the residents of wuhan were not allowed to leave the city without permission which was unprecedented in public health history besides measures on social aspects including the ban on massive gatherings such as concerts or competitions close of entertainment venues and public facilities schools closure and mandatory orders of wearing masks in public areas were applied to mitigate the outbreak by controlling the source of infection and block transmission routes pan et al 2020 as a result the respondents of our study reported the highly restricted mobility in wuhan china a total of 976 of them denied visiting crowded places which required high self-discipline and other public measures to cooperate to achieve this level of mobility restriction local authority organized a team of volunteers to facilitate the delivery of foods and other supply to each home quarantine family chinanewscom 2020 762 of participants received essential materials via this method that decreased the chance of outdoor activity and interaction with other nonetheless 85 of respondents said that staying away from crowds was the major reason to be not infected moreover there were emerging evidence suggesting these lockdown measures had certain roles on decreasing covid-19 incidence colbourn 2020 gostin  wiley 2020 klompas et al 2020 phelan katz  gostin 2020 the lancet respiratory medicine 2020 it was estimated that the wuhan travel ban delayed the epidemic progression by 35 days in mainland china chinazzi et al 2020 tian et al 2020 while reducing case importations to other countries by nearly 80 through mid-february chinazzi et al 2020 furthermore the rates of confirmed cases and the effective reproduction number rt that is the mean number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case at time t in a population declined since 24 january 2020 and fell below 10 since 6 february 2020 in a recent investigation pan et al 2020although intensive physical distancing and lockdown could help flattening the curve on covid-19 and preventing the sharp upward demand of health system capacities the consideration of social and economic effects of lockdown and knock-on effects on health such as mental health and interpersonal violence is necessary parmet  sinha 2020 yet our data showed that over half of the participants 571 felt calm during stay in hubei province which was somehow counterintuitive we hypothesized that the provision of sufficient logistic support to the isolated families by local authorities and clear information delivery to the public during a lockdown will help to ease the stress and minimize subsequent psychological impact brooks et al 2020 therefore local governments should be advised to create a comprehensive strategy and to prudentially evaluate the following concerns including racisms adequate explanations to the public about the rationale and upside logistic power and resources and cultural factors which may hinder the compliance before implementing large-scale mobility restrictions parmet  sinha 2020 the administration of lockdown could even lead to precarious situations that could heighten transmission in some countries if corresponding supports are not tailor-made and comprehensive based on their own economic and social conditions such as workers may be packed in state-run shelter during india lockdown pulla 2020 likewise the announcement of closing the gambling industry during the first half of february in macau was accompanied with foreseen policies of financial and resources supply could be one of the references of administration of any kind of measures macao sar government portal 2020cadditionally the significant behavior changes among participants before and during outbreak consisted of more wearing a mask outdoor wash hands more frequently clean and disinfect home more frequently and less meal gatherings although the transmission of sars-cov-2 was commonly believed via droplet and contact no evidence of wearing a surgical mask alone by healthy persons can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses including covid-19 currently while inappropriate usedisposal may even increase risk world health organization who 2020a however none of the participants in our study agreed that it was less important to wash hands after wearing masks and all of them 100 believed that the incidence of accidental touching the face or nose after wearing a mask would be reduced the effectiveness of personal protective measures in preventing pandemic influenza transmission by meta-analysis showed a significant protective effect of hand hygiene but mixed results for mask use and thus wearing mask was suggested to be applied alongside with hands hygiene saunders-hastings et al 2017 wearing mask might also act as a symbolism on increasing individual awareness of good hygiene practice klompas et al 2020 however the universal mask-wearing scheme in public should be emphasized on the concurrent hand hygiene practice and social distancing as a bundle while the allocation and availability of resources should be taken into account first to ensure adequate protection for healthcare workers emanuel et al 2020there were some limitations in this study the eliza kits used for antibody detection were qualitative and not able to provide titers information although the sample size of this questionnaire was limited and recall bias was inevitable its implication may indirectly reflect the effectiveness of public health interventions in wuhan china including sanitary cordon traffic restriction social distancing home confinement centralized quarantine and universal symptom survey such interventions were aimed at preventing individuals from face-to-face interaction and preventing asymptomatic covid-19 patients from spreading the coronavirus within the community the lack of infected citizens limits for further comparison of difference of measures or behavior and further studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness of each preventive measure on covid-19 at the individual level moreover some of the participants had stayed in their relative home where the cleaning duty was not their responsibilities hence the question of home cleaning might partially reflect the attitudes from their relativesfriendsour findings were in line with common preventive measures advised by the world health organization good personal hygiene and adequate preventive measures such as less gathering frequent handwashing in addition to wearing a mask outdoor were common grounds among 42 uninfected participants during the stay in hubei province under covid-19 outbreak furthermore the success of the lockdown and self-quarantine policy in hubei province could contribute to the local authoritys strong logistical provision and transparency of information about the policys rationale in order to maintain better mental health and thus increase compliance and efficacy of preventive measuresthe use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease covid-19 has been controversial with differing guidelines issued by different agencies chen et al 2020 coronavirus disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sars-cov-2 a beta-coronavirus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sars cov chen et al 2020 seasonal alpha and beta coronaviruses cause common colds croup and broncholitis the transmission mode of coronaviruses in humans is similar thought to be by droplet contact and sometimes airborne routes ong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 the world health organization recommends surgical mask for health workers providing routine care to a coronavirus disease patient world health organisation who 2020 whilst the us centers for disease control and prevention recommend a respirator center for disease control and prevention cdc 2020 most authorities are recommending that community members not wear a mask and that a mask should only be worn by a sick patient also referred to as source control chughtai et al 2020 there are more randomised controlled trials of community use of masks in well people than studies of the use by sick people source control the aim of this study was to review the randomised controlled trials evidence for use of masks and respirators by the community health care workers and sick patients for prevention of infectionwe searched medline and embase for clinical trials on masks and respirators using the key words mask respirator and personal protective equipment the search was conducted between 1 march to april 17 2020 and all randomised controlled trials published before the search date were included two authors crm and aac reviewed the title and abstracts to identify randomised controlled trials on masks and respirators we also searched relevant papers from the reference lists of previous clinical trials and systematic reviews studies that were not randomised controlled trials were about anaesthesia or not about prevention of infection were excluded animal studies experimental and observational epidemiologic studies were also excluded studies published in english language were includedwe found 602 papers on medline and 250 on embase 820 papers were excluded by title and abstract review full texts were reviewed for 32 papers and 18 were selected in this review results were reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma criteria moher et al 2015in general the results show protection for healthcare workers and community members and likely benefit of masks used as source control we found eight clinical trials aiello et al 2012 simmerman et al 2011 larson et al 2010 aiello et al 2010 macintyre et al 2009 cowling et al 2008 15 16 on the use of masks in the community table 1
 in the community masks appear to be more effective than hand hygiene alone and both together are more protective aiello et al 2012 aiello et al 2010 however the randomised controlled trials which measured both hand hygiene and masks measured the effect of hand hygiene alone but not of masks alone aiello et al 2012 aiello et al 2010 16 masks were only examined in combination with hand hygiene therefore the protective effect of masks and hand hygiene combined could be due to both interventions together or the effect of masks alone the use of hand hygiene alone in these trials was not effective in more than one trial interventions had to be used within 36 hours of exposure to be effective aiello et al 2012 15 16to date six randomised controlled trials radonovich et al 2019 jacobs et al 2009 19 20 21 22 has been conducted on the use of masks andor respirators by healthcare workers in health care settings table 2
 the healthcare workers trials table 2 used different interventions and different outcome measures and one was in the outpatient setting a japanese study had only 32 subjects and likely was underpowered to find any difference between masks and control jacobs et al 2009 two north american trials of masks and respirators against influenza infection found no difference between the arms but neither had a control arm to differentiate equal efficacy from equal inefficacy radonovich et al 2019 22 without a control group to determine rates of influenza in unprotected healthcare workers neither study is able to determine efficacy if no difference was observed between the two interventions a serologic study showed that up to 23 of unprotected healthcare workers a rate identical to that observed in loeb the trial which also used serology contract influenza during outbreaks elder et al 1996 which suggests lack of efficacy studies of nosocomial influenza generally find lower influenza attack rates in unprotected healthcare workers than observed in the loeb trial salgado et al 2002further problems with this study are that the majority of subjects were defined as having influenza on the basis of serological positivity 22 the 10 seroconversion to pandemic h1n109 with no pandemic virus isolation or positive pcr observed in the trial suggests that pandemic h1n109 was circulating in ontario before april 2009 which is unlikely the overall flu rate was 38 higher than the expected attack rate in a pandemic 22 the majority of subjects defined as having influenza were by serologya serological definition of influenza can be affected by vaccination the authors claim they excluded influenza vaccinated subjects in the outcome but according to figure 1
 these subjects 130 in total are included in the analysis if they had been excluded and even if no other subjects were excluded the total analysed would be 348 which is lower than the 422 subjects analysed 22 these 130 vaccinated subjects should have been excluded entirely from the analysis the vaccination status of subjects with seropositivity is not provided in the paper but it appears people with positive serology due to vaccination may have wrongly been counted as influenza cases 22in both the north american trials the intervention comprised wearing the mask or respirator when in contact with recognized ili or when doing a high risk procedure which is a targeted strategy radonovich et al 2019 22 one was in an outpatient setting radonovich et al 2019 we conducted a randomised controlled trial comparing the targeted strategy tested in the two north american studies with the wearing of respiratory protection during an entire shift and showed efficacy for continual but not targeted use of a respirator 19 the study also did not show efficacy for a surgical mask worn continually and therefore no difference between a surgical mask and targeted use of a respirator 19 which is consistent with the findings of the north american trials radonovich et al 2019 22 in summary the evidence is consistent that a respirator must be worn throughout the shift to be protective targeted use of respirators only when doing high risk procedures and medical mask use is not protective another randomised controlled trial we conducted in china showed efficacy for continual use of a respirator but not for a mask and also found fit-testing of the respirator did not affect efficacy 20 however this may be specific to the quality of the tested product and is not generalisable to other respirators  fit testing is a necessary part of respirator use chughtai et al 2015for healthcare workers there is evidence of efficacy of respirators if worn continually during a shift but no evidence of efficacy of a mask 19 20 for hospitals where covid-19 patients are being treated there is growing evidence of widespread contamination of the ward environment well beyond 2 meters from the patient as well as aerosol transmission ong et al 2020 santarpia et al 2020 guo et al 2020 several studies have found sars-cov-2 on air vents and in air samples in intensive care units and covid-19 wards santarpia et al 2020 chia et al 2020 liu et al 2020 and an experimental study showed the virus in air samples three hours after aerosolization van doremalen et al 2020 the weight of this evidence and the precautionary principle macintyre et al 2014 macintyre et al 2014 favors respirators for healthcare workers we showed lower rates of infection outcomes in the medical mask arm compared to control but the difference was not significant 20 it could be that larger trials are needed to demonstrate efficacy of a mask but any protection is far less than from a respirator a trial we conducted in vietnam of 2-layered cotton cloth masks compared to medical masks showed a lower rate of infection in the medical mask group and a 13 times higher risk of infection in the cloth mask arm 21 the study suggests cloth masks may increase the risk of infection 21 but may not be generalizable to all home-made masks the material design and adequacy of washing of cloth masks may have been a factor macintyre et al 2020 there are no other randomised controlled trial of cloth masks published but if any protection is offered by these it would be less than even a medical mask
table 3
shows the trials of source control there were five randomised controlled trials identified of masks used by sick patients johnson et al 2009 35 36 37 one was an experimental study of 9 influenza patients which did not measure clinical endpoints johnson et al 2009 participants with confirmed influenza coughed onto a petri dish wearing a n95 respirator or a mask no influenza grew on the medium a trial of 105 sick patients wearing a mask or no mask in the household found no significant difference between arms 36 however the trial was terminated prematurely and did not meet recruitment targets so was probably underpowered one randomised controlled trial was conducted among hajj pilgrims with both well and sick pilgrims wearing masks and low rates of ili were reported among contact of mask pilgrims 37 our randomised controlled trial is the largest available and studied 245 patients randomised to mask or control 35 compliance was suboptimal in the mask group and some controls wore masks the intention to treat analysis showed no difference but when analysed by actual mask use the rate of infection in household contacts was lower in those who wore masks 35 a trial with an experimental design was published in april 2020 examining a range of viruses including seasonal human coronaviruses leung et al 2020 this showed that coronaviruses are preferentially found in aerosolized particles compared to large droplets and could be expelled by normal tidal breathing wearing a surgical mask prevented virus from being exhaledthere are more randomised controlled trials of community use of masks in well people aiello et al 2012 simmerman et al 2011 larson et al 2010 aiello et al 2010 macintyre et al 2009 cowling et al 2008 15 16 than studies of the use by sick people also referred to as source control and these trials are larger than the few on source control johnson et al 2009 35 36 the evidence suggests protection of masks in high transmission settings such as household and college settings especially if used early if combined with hand hygiene and if wearers are compliant aiello et al 2012 aiello et al 2010 macintyre et al 2009 cowling et al 2008 15 16 if masks protect in high transmission settings they should also protect in crowded public spaces including workplaces buses trains planes and other closed settings the trial which did not show efficacy used influenza as the outcome measure simmerman et al 2011 which is a rare outcome so requires a larger sample size for adequate power and may have been underpoweredfor healthcare workers the only trials to show a difference between respirators and masks demonstrated efficacy for continuous use of a respirator through a clinical shift but not masks 19 20 the two trials which showed no difference are widely cited as evidence that masks provide equal protection as respirators radonovich et al 2019 22 however without a control arm the absence of difference between arms could reflect equal efficacy or inefficacy and it is not possible to draw any conclusions about efficacy the high rates of influenza in the loeb trial suggest equal inefficacy and further there were likely misclassified outcomes in the trial by inclusion of seropositive vaccinated healthcare workers which would have biased the results 22 the outpatient setting in the us trial may have had lower exposure risk than the inpatient setting of other trials radonovich et al 2019 in both the north american trials the intervention comprised wearing the mask or respirator when in contact with recognized ili or when doing a high risk procedure radonovich et al 2019 22 the underlying assumption that the majority of infections in healthcare workers occur during self-identified high-risk exposures is not supported by any evidence it assumes healthcare workers can accurately identify when they are risk in a busy clinical setting when the majority of infections may occur when healthcare workers are unaware of the risk such as when walking through a busy emergency room or ward where aerosolized virus may be present conversely infections could occur outside the workplace this could explain the lack of difference if there was no actual efficacy of either arm and if much of the infection occurs in unrecognised situations of risk either within or outside the workplacein practice hospital infection control divides infections into droplet or airborne spread and recommends droplet mask or airborne respirator precautions accordingly macintyre et al 2017 in a pooled analysis of both healthcare worker trials we showed that continual use of a respirator is more efficacious in protecting healthcare workers even against infections assumed to be spread by the droplet route macintyre et al 2017 medical masks did not significantly protect against viral bacterial droplet or other infection outcomes however the summary odds ratio for masks was less than one which suggests a low level of protection targeted use of respirator protected against bacterial and droplet infections but not against viral infections suggesting viral infections may be more likely to be airborne in the hospital setting macintyre et al 2017the five available studies of mask use by sick patients suggest a benefit but are much smaller trials than the community trials two without clinical endpoints and with less certainty around the findings johnson et al 2009 35 36 37 only 35 trials examined clinical outcomes in close contacts 35 36 37many systematic reviews have been conducted on masks respirators and other ppe in past cowling et al 2010 bin-reza et al 2012 gralton and mclaws 2010 gamage et al 2005 jefferson et al 2009 jefferson et al 2011 jefferson et al 2008 aledort et al 2007 lee et al 2011 verbeek et al 2019 these reviews generally examined multiple interventions eg masks and hand hygiene etc often combined different outcome measures that were not directly comparable and were inconclusive moreover most of these reviews did not include more recent randomised controlled trials radonovich et al 2019 21 this systematic review only focuses on masks and respirators and contains all new studiesin summary there is a growing body of evidence supporting all three indications for respiratory protection  community healthcare workers and sick patients source control the largest number of randomised controlled trials have been done for community use of masks by well people in high-transmission settings such as household or college settings there is benefit in the community if used early and if compliant they also found no evidence of efficacy of hand hygiene or health education suggesting mask use is more protective than hand hygienerespirators protect healthcare workers if worn continually but not if worn intermittently in self-identified situations of risk this supports the suggestion that the health care environment is a risk to healthcare workers even when not doing aerosol generating procedures or caring for a known infectious patient for covid-19 specifically the growing body of evidence showing aerosolisation of the virus in the hospital ward highlights the risk of inadvertent exposure for healthcare workers and supports the use of airborne precautions at all times on the ward santarpia et al 2020 chia et al 2020 liu et al 2020 further the rule of 1-2 m of spatial separation is not based on good evidence with most research showing that droplets can travel further than 2m and that infections cannot be neatly separated into droplet and airborne macintyre et al 2017 bahl et al 2020 in the uk one healthcare trust found almost one in five healthcare workers to be infected with covid-19 keeley et al 2020 the deaths of healthcare workers from covid-19 reflect this risk zhan et al 2020 the use of masks by sick people despite being the whos only recommendation for mask use by community members during covid-19 pandemic is supported by the smallest body of evidence source control is probably a sensible recommendation given the suggestion of protection and given specific data on coronaviruses showing protection leung et al 2020 it may help if visitors and febrile patients wear a mask in the healthcare setting whether in primary care or hospitals universal face mask use is likely to have the most impact on epidemic growth in the community given the high risk of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission he et al 2020

the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 outbreak emerged in china in december 2019 and it was recognised as a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 1 as of 3 may 2020 a total of 3349786 cases and 238 628 deaths have been reported worldwide 2 nosocomial spread and infection of healthcare workers hcws are a major concern in italy hcws are paying a heavy price in addition to their professional and humanitarian efforts with 21338 cases more than 104 of total italian cases 3 and 154 deaths 4 among physicians protecting hcws from sars-cov-2 is therefore of great importance for individual hcw and for their role in fighting this devastating pandemic effectively claims of insufficient protection of hcws by personal protective equipment in particular with regards to the use of surgical masks have fuelled the scientific and social media debate in several countries while both surgical masks and n95 respirators are worn by hcw for self protection they have different intended uses 5 surgical masks do not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and fit the face loosely while n95 respirators are able to do so by fitting tightly to the wearers face and fulfil strict filtration requirements in fact except for aerosol generating procedures requiring higher level of respiratory protection with filtering respirators ie n95 respirators who considers surgical masks adequate for the routine care of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 patients 6 instead the centers for disease control cdc and the european center for disease control guidelines ecdc have a more cautious approach acknowledging that the exact role of airborne aerosol route in the transmission of sars-cov-2 is still largely unknown 7 8 the direct evidence supporting the who guidelines is based on very few case reports on the absence of sars-cov-2 in air samples taken in highly protected environments where a rapid dilution of aerosols occurs the absence of infection of hcws exposed for a limited time or limited viral loads or on modelling of epidemiologic patterns of transmission 912 in contrast the airborne aerosol opportunistic route of transmission has been documented for sars and mers caused by closely related coronaviruses responsible of severe nosocomial infections among hcws aerosol filtering respirators were consequently recommended for sars during 200203 outbreak 13 it is worth remembering that canadian health authorities modified their earlier recommendations in favour of a more strict respiratory protection after the deaths of several hcws 14 the presence of sars-cov-2 in aerosols has been documented in experimental 15 and real life conditions in crowded poorly ventilated hospital areas unrelated to aerosol generating procedures 16 also spontaneous cough generates aerosols not only droplets 17 18 and covid-19 patients may infect hcws in this way especially if they are unable to wear facemasks due to hypoxia and need of oxygen therapy moreover none of the above mentioned guidelines adopted the suggested grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade approach for directing public health policy decisions and they did not explicitly consider the potentially catastrophic consequences of deferring the recommendation of n95 respirators for hcws while awaiting more robust evidencethere are already some systematic reviews addressing the role of n95 respirators in protecting hcws offering however a debatable interpretation of the estimates of the effect ie reviews analyses did not take into account the clustered design of rcts 1922 we therefore undertook a systematic review with a different perspective and methodology given the exceptional disease burden expected from this pandemic 23 the central role of protecting hcws and the need of a careful definition of the outcomes which are critical for unbiased public health policy decisions 24 indeed strengthening the preparedness and resiliency of health care systems to this pandemic crisis occurs not only avoiding sars-cov-2 infection but also preventing any hcw respiratory infection causing absenteeism from work we therefore conducted a systematic review aimed at assessing the efficacy of n95 respirators versus surgical masks for the prevention of respiratory tract infections transmission among hcws the evidence from the review can then be used for the development of an appropriate grade framework for public health policy guidelinesrandomized controlled trials rcts run in healthcare settings were considered eligible randomization was allowed both at individual and cluster levelhwcs exposed to sars-cov-2 or any other respiratory infection subgroups in-patient versus out-patient hospital settingn95 respirators versus surgical masks an n95 respirator is a particulate-filtering facepiece respirator that meets the us national institute for occupational safety and health niosh n95 classification of air filtration meaning that it filters at least 95 of airborne particles n95 respirators are considered functionally equivalent to certain respirators regulated under non-us jurisdictions such as ffp2 respirators of the european union and kn95 respirators of china whereas the term surgical mask was considered equivalent to medical masks defined surgical procedural isolation laser fluid resistant or face masks that meet bacterial and particle filtration efficiency standards required by the us food and drug administration astm standard f210011 but are not certifiable as n95 respirators 22as suggested by the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions 26 we identified a priori the following outcomesoutcome definitions are reported in s1 appendix outcomes and assessment measurementswe searched pubmed embase and the cochrane library databases from inception to march 21 2020 to identify published randomized controlled trials rcts on evaluating the use of masks for preventing epidemic influenza relevant reviews were consulted for additional studies to consider the full search strategy is reported above the full search strategy is reported in s1 appendix search strategytwo reviewers independently screened the articles based on the titles abstracts and full texts then two reviewers independently extracted the following data from the included studies first author publication year country type of influenza detected season of interest details of study population and intervention study design sample size settings and outcome findings all disagreements were resolved by discussiontwo reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias rob of the selected rcts using the cochrane risk of bias tool also in cluster-rcts specific risk of bias were considered further details are reported in s1 appendix risk of bias assessmentwe pooled data from studies with similar interventions and outcomes for the intention-to-treat analysis to calculate relative risk rr and the corresponding 95 confidence intervals cis for cluster rcts we applied the specific method described in the cochrane handbook 27 to account for the clustering and obtain an adjusted cis when the cluster rct did not considered the clustering in the analysis we multiplied the standard error of the effect estimate from the analysis ignoring the clustering by the square root of the design effect both the number of participants and the number experiencing the event were divided by the same design effect 27 we then calculated the pooled estimates by using both the fixed-effects and the dersimonian and laird random-effects model 28 29 in the absence of heterogeneity the fixed-effects and the random-effects models provide similar results whereas the random-effects model is considered more appropriate when heterogeneity is found heterogeneity between study-specific estimates was tested with the cochran q test 30 and measured with the i2 statistic 31 we performed a subgroup analysis based on the settings ie in-patients vs out-patients publication bias was evaluated with funnel plot if a sufficient number of studies was present a probability level 005 was considered statistically significant except for heterogeneity whose level of statistical significance was set at p  010 all statistical analyses were performed using review manager revman version 53 32given the emergency context of this systematic review and the evidence available insofar we used the results of our meta-analysis to quantify as precisely as possible what value an immediate adoption of n95 respirators for hcws managing covid-19 patients could have compared to the added benefit derived from further research we therefore used the claxton model 33 to obtain the best estimate of immediate implementation of the n95 respirators through the point estimate of the rr of the corresponding meta-analysis while the value of deferring the n95 implementation until further research would be available was measured through the upper 90 ci with a time horizon limited to an infectious outbreak we adopted the worst-case scenario for public health decisions the least likely benefit which is represented by the lower limit of a confidence interval placed around the treatment effect point estimate 34 in fact cis with different levels of confidence can demonstrate that there is differential evidence for different degrees of benefit or harm for example it might be possible to report the same analysis results i with 95 confidence that the intervention does not cause harm ii with 90 confidence that it has some effect and iii with 80 confidence that it has a patient-important benefit these elements may suggest both usefulness of the intervention and the need for additional research 35 see s1 appendix data analysis and synthesis of resultswe evaluated the overall quality of the evidence for primary and secondary outcomes using the grade approach 32 adjusted estimates were considered for judging the quality of the evidence for primary outcomes absolute effects were calculated at 95 ci and 90 ci 36 a summary of findings including the quality of the evidence reasons

first a review protocol of this systematic review was not made publicly available in prospero due to the need to publish timely a review on covid-19 second wearing n95 respirators is only one component among a series of complex procedures so that the identified effect cannot exclusively be attributed to this intervention the source of infection community rather than the workplace cannot be ascertained in any of the trials third one rct required hcws to wear n95 respirators only when caring for patients with febrile respiratory illness 37 whereas all others specified continuous respirator use while one study was performed in an outpatient setting that can be considered at moderate risk of transmission 5 finally our meta-analyses did not investigate the adherence of wearing an n95 respirator one of the included trials reported discomfort of using n95 respirators 38 as well we did not anticipate mortality as outcome in the review because of the low mortality rate of sars-cov-2 irrespectively of being hcws or not indeed the mortality rate among hcws should be related to the infection rate which was our primary outcome thus we call for future studies investigating the mortality rate in hcwsthe main strength of our study was the use of appropriate cochrane methods for analysing cluster randomized studies by inflating variances this method allows to obtain adjusted estimates of relative risks indeed if clustering is ignored p values will be artificially small resulting in false positive conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention in addition we adopted the claxton model to quantify the trade-off between immediate implementation of the intervention versus deferring it while awaiting further evidence finally we offered a solid ground for the development of future evidence-based clinical guidance based on the quality of evidence by grade approach which can be applied in a variety of decision-making contexts including urgent responses as the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 pandemic 45 46this is the first systematic review on the efficacy of n95 respirators versus surgical masks among hcws accounting for possible bias derived from cluster trials and evaluating the findings from a public health policy perspective we found evidence that n95 respirators halve the risk of any respiratory infection compared to surgical masks considering that the absenteeism from work due to healthcare related infections hampers heavily the resilience of healthcare systems facing an infectious pandemic the protective effect of n95 respirators for this primary outcome could produce large benefits in the current context furthermore the immediate implementation of the intervention rather than deferring it until more studies will be available seems justified on a sound quantitative basis the evidence from the current study could be used to inform the production of trustworthy grade based guidelines for the prevention of sars-cov-2 infection among hcwscoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which first emerged in china in december 2019 and has since spread to most countries around the world resulting in the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic 1-3 the virus primarily spreads between people through respiratory droplets which are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or by touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching their own mouth nose or possibly their eyes the risk of getting severe covid-19 is higher in health care workers hcws who are in close contact with confirmed covid-19 cases the latest figures show thousands of hcws getting infected with a large percentage of them dying 4in order to minimize risk hcws are required to follow accepted infection control practices aside from hand hygiene one of the infection control measures is the routine use of a face mask many countries including pakistan are currently using face masks in their pandemic plans face mask works by providing a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment 5in resource-limited settings where the incidence of infectious disease is high and the environmental conditions of hospitals are often poor hospitals may rely heavily on a face mask to protect medical staff against covid-19 and to prevent cross-contamination among patients and hcws the use of a face mask among hcws is strongly recommended by the world health organization who and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc as a standard for transmission-based precaution 67 moreover the correct use of these masks is particularly important especially during this time when its use is becoming highly prevalent 8the who states that incorrect use and disposal of this mask may actually increase the rate of transmission if you wear a mask then you must know how to use it and discard it properly 7 there is evidence that the hcws have inadequate knowledge and poor practice regarding the use of surgical mask 9 the purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge attitude and practices of hcws in wearing a face mask particularly a standard surgical face mask to limit the spread of covid-19this cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted at the department of orthopedic surgery dr ruth k m pfau civil hospital affiliated to dow university of health sciences karachi pakistan in march 2020 one monththe study participants were hcws that is consultant medical officer postgraduate trainee house officer and paramedical staff a convenient sampling method was used and a sample size of 384 was calculated considering 5 precision 95 confidence interval and 52 as the correct practice of using face masks 5 keeping a minimum sample size of 384 in mind a total of 392 patients were registered in the study durationthe study was conducted by interview using a semi-structured questionnaire the questionnaire was developed with the help of previous literature on the proper use of surgical face mask and the guidelines of the centre for health protection and the cdc and consisted of two parts1 basic demographic characteristics age gender job designation and 2 knowledge attitude and practices regarding the use of a face mask to limit covid-19 exposure 51011 prior to the inception of the study the nature and purpose of the study were explained to each respondent and informed consent was obtained for the convenience of analyses each correct response in the knowledge category good practice or positive attitude was scored 1 and each incorrect response bad practice or negative attitude was scored 0 the total number of questions was 16 and the final score was calculated and then labeled according to the percentage out of 16 of correct responses as good 80 moderate 60-80 and poor 60the information obtained from the participants was entered and analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences sdss statistics for windows version 220 ibm corp armonk ny usa mean with standard deviations were calculated for age and frequency with percentages for categorical variablesa total of 392 participants were registered with a mean age of 4237  1334 years out of which 341 869 were males and 51 13 were females around 66 168 were consultants 91 232 were medical officers 117 298 were postgraduate trainees 30 77 were house officers and 88 224 were paramedical staffswhen the knowledge was assessed 564 knew the correct way of wearing a surgical mask 689 knew that there are three layers in a surgical mask and 53 knew how to identify the correct filter media barrier around 648 of participants knew the correct efficiency of masks that can actually protect against covid-19 whereas 756 were aware of the maximum duration of wearing a face mask when the study participants were asked about the extent to which surgical mask should cover 747 answered correctly and 92 correctly reported the purpose of the metal strip table 1as shown in table 2 on evaluating the correct practices 138 of participants used to remove the mask while talking to the patient 202 reused the mask and 449 correctly used the yellow-coded bag for disposal of the face mask around 939 of participants had a practice of wearing masks in clinics and 946 had a practice of wearing masks in hospital premises around 885 of participants were confident enough about their knowledge and practices of correctly wearing the face masksthe overall final results were good in 138 352 moderate in 178 454 and poor in 76 193face masks are used as a protective barrier to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms between patients hcws and the environment 12 however in order for face masks to provide effective protection the hcws must have an intimate knowledge of wearing and disposing of those in this study 885 of participants thought that they knew the proper steps of wearing a surgical face mask however only 35 obtained a good score by answering the procedural questions correctly these results may be because of its simplest design which leads many participants to mistakenly assume that they know the proper steps of wearing itthere was higher male participation in our study 869 compared with female participation 13 this finding can be attributed to the higher male enrolment in our institutionin this study 647 of participants obtained an overall moderate-to-poor score regarding the correct usage of a surgical face mask this low knowledge and practice may be because of recently circulating messages on social media claiming the proper way to wear the three-layered surgical mask like colored side facing out if you are sick and the white side facing out if you want to stop the germs from getting inthis is however false and misleading according to nawhen a columnist for medical mythbusters malaysia a non-governmental organization that works to counter myths and inaccurate facts on medical matters the correct way to wear a surgical mask is by wearing the colored side facing out independent of your health status the outer colored layer is hydrophobic or is a fluid-repelling layer and its main function is to prevent germs from sticking to it whereas the inner one is a hydrophilic layer that absorbs moisture from the air we breathe out if you wear it the other way round the moisture from the air will stick onto it thus making it easier for germs to stay there there is a middle layer that actually filters the microorganism 13cloth mask re-use of a surgical mask and its extended use are commonly seen in pakistan during the extended outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic it is highly unlikely for low-income countries that they will be able to provide disposable face masks for that extended period of time and may have to ration the use of these products in this study around 882 hcws agreed that cloth mask is not as effective as a regular surgical mask and about 798 knew that used surgical face mask cannot be re-used around 756 knew the correct maximum duration of using it other studies also highlighted similar findings concluding that cloth mask re-use and extended use of mask makes it ineffective still hcws are sometimes forced to do it due to the increasing shortage of these masks we observed that wearing the same mask without removing it between patient encounters and disposing it properly at the end of the day is better than re-using it still if re-using it due to shortage it is better to fold the mask in such a way that the outer contaminated surface is held inward followed by storing it in a clean sealable paper bag or container 14-16there is not enough evidence to prove that wearing a surgical mask protects every person from covid-19 the who currently recommended that only hcws and people who are ill and those who are caring for the ill need to wear a mask to protect themselves from covid-19 however in low-income countries like pakistan where the incidence of infectious disease is high and the hospital environmental conditions are often poor our hcws rely almost entirely on a face mask to limit the spread of covid-19 17the who established a color-coded bin system for proper disposal of biomedical waste in hospitals 18 however when it was asked from our participants 449 disposed it in the yellow-coded bag for disposal of face mask this shows poor knowledge of hcws regarding the safe disposal of biomedical wastesome of the limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of study design limited to a single governmental hospital further longitudinal studies should be carried out on a larger sample size and both private and government hospitals should be included before the results could be generalized moreover different types of masks can be comparedknowledge attitude and practice of hcws regarding the use of surgical face masks were found to be inadequate studied hcws had a positive attitude but moderate-to-poor level of knowledge and practice regarding the use of surgical face mask hcws and general public awareness campaigns regarding the proper use of face mask by utilizing all social media available resources would be helpful during this pandemicsince the positive laboratory test result of patient 1 in codogno italy on 21 february 2020 italian medical health personnel have been fighting the covid-19 disease caused by a new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in the past two decades two other coronaviruses switched hosts into humans sars-cov in the guangdong province china finally contained on 5 july 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus which has caused around 2500 cases since september 2012 1 the sars and middle east respiratory syndrome outbreaks were characterised by the so-called super spreading events often occurring in hospitals 2there are currently official recommendations available on this topic from the world health organization who and nationalinternational scientific societies 36 the aim of this article is not only to summarise some of the official recommendations ie who european of centre of disease prevention and control and the italian department of health but also to provide a comparison between themthe risk of transmission of respiratory infections for healthcare workers depends on several conditions some of them are nonspecific such as prolonged exposure inadequate hand hygiene and personal protective equipment ppe insufficient spacing or rooms without negative pressure or insufficient air changes every hour 7 in healthcare workers clinical practice another important variable to consider is the exhaled air dispersion distance during oxygen administration and ventilatory supportall data relating to exhaled air dispersion during such procedures come from scientific studies conducted in a negative pressure room on a high-fidelity human patient simulator hps that represents a 70 kg adult male sitting on a 45 inclined hospital bed exhaled air dispersion distance from the hps has been evaluated using a laser smoke visualisation method and calculated on the median sagittal plane table 1 shows the maximum dispersion distances the medium values are as follows
oxygen therapy via nasal cannula exhaled air spreads from the hpss nostrils towards the end of the bed almost horizontally to 66 cm when the oxygen flow setting is 1 lmin1 to 70 cm when it is increased to 3 lmin1 and 1 m when it is 35 lmin1 8oxygen therapy via oronasal masks the exhaled air jet reaches 40 cm with an oxygen flow of 4 lmin1 9oxygen therapy via venturi mask exhaled air dispersion distance reduces with increasing lung injury delivering 24 oxygen with a flow rate at 4 lmin1 in a normal lung and severe lung injury setting produces an air dispersion of 40 cm and 32 cm respectively when 40 oxygen is delivered at an 8 lmin1 flow rate the exhaled air dispersion distance is in the same two lung settings 33 cm and 29 cm respectively 10 these distances were studied in a general ward without negative pressure but with double exhaust fans for room ventilation when they were off the air ventilation rates on the ward dropped significantly and the exhaled smoke filled the ward within 5 minoxygen therapy via non-rebreathing mask exhaled air dispersion distance is 10 cm irrespective of oxygen flow rate 681012 lmin1 in either normal lung or severe lung injury 6cpap via oronasal mask cpap 5 10 15 or 20 cmh2o exhaled air disperses evenly in all directions through the masks vent holes at a very low normalised smoke concentration irrespective of the severity of lung injury 11 and therefore it was not feasible to measure distinct exhaled air dispersioncpap via nasal cannula nasal pillows there is an increase of air dispersion with increasing cpap and a reduction of air dispersion with worsening lung injury using two types of nasal pillows at a maximum cpap of 20 cmh2o and with a normal lung maximum air dispersion distances are 264 cm nuance pro gel and 332 cm swift fx 11hfnc in a normal lung there is an increase of air dispersion distance with increasing flow to a maximum of 172 cm at 60 lmin1 with this flow rate when nasal cannula is tightly connected lateral air dispersion is negligible otherwise it can reach 62 cm worsening lung injury causes a reduction in air dispersion distance from hps 11niv via full-face mask in the bilevel setting inspiratory positive airway pressure ipap 10 cmh2o and expiratory positive airway pressure epap 5 cmh2o with a single limb circuit connected to hps the exhaled air jet spreads through the masks holes up to 693 cm 618 cm and 58 cm in the normal lung mild lung injury and severe lung injury setting respectively increasing ipap leads to increasing exhaled air dispersion distance eg with ipap 18 cmh2o exhaled air jet reaches 916 cm 12niv via helmets with ipap 12 cmh2o and epap 10 cmh2o the exhaled air dispersion distance is 17 cm in normal lung and 15 cm in mild or severe lung injury with ipap 20 cmh2o the air dispersion distances in three different settings normal lung mild lung injury and severe lung injury are 27 23 and 18 cm respectively eg oxygen head tent sea-long waxahachie tx usa helmets with a tight air cushion around the neckhelmet interface in a double limb circuit have negligible air dispersion during niv application eg castar r starmed wokingham uk 12nebulisation of drugs with the jet nebuliser causes sideways leakage of exhaled air and the distance increases with increasing lung injury dispersion distance is 45 cm in the normal lung setting oxygen consumption 200 mlmin1 lung compliance 70 mlcm1 h2o 54 cm in mild lung injury oxygen consumption 300 mlmin1 lung compliance 35 mlcm1 h2o and 80 cm in severe lung injury oxygen consumption 500 mlmin1 lung compliance 10 mlcm1 h2o 10coughing without wearing a mask produces an exhaled air jet on a median sagittal plane of 68 cm from hps the patient wearing a surgical mask reduces this distance to 30 cm while wearing a n95 mask the distance was reduced to 15 cm it is necessary to be aware that wearing a mask does not prevent air leakage between the mask and the skin air dispersion distance is 28 cm with a surgical mask and 15 cm with a n95 mask 13thus we can state that cpap via an oronasal mask and niv via a helmet equipped with an inflatable neck cushion are the ventilatory support methods that allow the minimum room air contamination however we can argue that pressures set during niv via helmet ventilation are relatively low moreover all examined studies used smoke as the air exhaled marker while viral transmission seems to happen through droplets droplets are indeed heavier thus they should follow a briefer trajectory than the smoke all results shown should therefore represent the upper limit of exhaled air dispersion and thus overestimate it its interesting to note however that all studies except the one that used a venturi mask were conducted in a negative pressure room with at least six air changes per hour minimum air changes recommended by who is 12 per hour 4 14 in medical wards not equipped with negative pressure rooms like those which admit most covid-19 patients because of reduced bed availability it is reasonable to imagine a higher exhaled air dispersion and contaminationpatients should be placed in isolation rooms with negative pressure at least 12 air changes per hour a dedicated bathroom and if possible an anteroom if negative pressure rooms are not available choose rooms with natural ventilation with airflow of at least 160 ls1 per patient 4 if single rooms are not accessible patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection should be placed in the same room patients beds should be located at least 1 m away from each other it is critical that the area prepared to receive suspect patients is equipped with all the necessary ppe all patients should wear a medical mask it is critical to limit the number of healthcare professionals in contact with confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 it is better to put together a team of healthcare professionals who deal exclusively with suspected or confirmed cases to minimise the risk of transmission a reminder to all the people who enter the patients room is recommended including healthcare workers and family membersfabric masks cotton or gauze should not be used and are not recommended in any circumstance medical or surgical masks could be flat or plated some are cup-shaped and suitable for covering the nose and mouth secure them to the head with elastics or laces these devices are made to guarantee one-way protection for healthcare workers in order to capture their droplets respirators are tight masks that must seal off the wearers face and work in a bidirectional sense in particular for the protection of the wearer eg from dust or fibres present in the air the american system classifies ventilators according to the percentage of particles with a diameter 03 m that can be filtered by the masks themselves while the european system distinguishes them according to the ffp123 classification the n95 mask according to the american classification system is able to remove 95 of all particles with a diameter 03 m and it is comparable to a ffp2 mask according to the european classification system table 2 15the who advises healthcare workers to keep the same mask ffp2 or higher while routine care is being performed on multiple patients who have the same diagnosis in order to rationalise the use of ppe and avoid an early depletion of stocks evidence indicates that ffp23 maintain their protection even when they are used for a long time however wearing a respirator for 4 h can cause discomfort and should be avoided 3 masks and respirators are important ppe for protection against sars-cov-2 but alone are not enoughcorrect ppe depends on the specific activity and healthcare setting table 3 shows which devices should be used based on the activity and contact with the patient 3 healthcare workers must wear a ffp2 mask goggles or face shield a long-sleeved water-resistant gown and gloves if water-resistant gowns are not available single-use plastic aprons should be worn over the gowns to avoid body contamination after the patients examination ppe must be properly stripped and disposed of healthcare workers should avoid contact with the eyes and nose via potentially contaminated gloves or bare handstable 4 further illustrates the european of centre of disease prevention recommendations for the protection of healthcare workers 5a recent who document illustrates the correct dressing and undressing procedure while a recent italian department of health indication also summarises the dressing and undressing procedure table 5 6 during the undressing procedure it is crucial to avoid contact with potentially contaminated ppe face skin and mucosa it is important to dispose of single-use ppe in the undressing areamedical devices must be disposable or dedicated to a single patient stethoscope sphygmomanometer and thermometers if these devices are used on different patients they must be washed and disinfected after visiting each patient using 70 ethyl alcohol clean and disinfect the surfaces with which patients come into contactmoving or transporting patients outside their room or dedicated area should be avoided if not necessary use portable x-ray machines or bedside chest ultrasound if it is necessary to transport the patient use pre-established preferential routes to minimise the exposure of healthcare professionals and other patients by making the latter wear a mask make sure that transport personnel follow standard precautions and wear ppe 17considering the global shortage of ppe the following strategies can guarantee greater availability of ppe using ppe appropriately allows us to preserve it for situations of real transmission risk therefore it is necessary to select the appropriate ppe and learn the right way to wear remove and dispose of them properly strategies for optimising ppe include the following
telemedicine to evaluate suspected cases of covid-19 eg toll-free numbers available in italyuse physical barriers to reduce exposure to the covid-19 virus such as glass or plastic windows this approach could be implemented in triage procedureslimit the number of healthcare workers in patients rooms if they are not directly involved in patient care schedule all the activities in order to reduce the number of times entering the patients rooms eg check vital signs when administering drugs or leaving food while performing other routine activities and plan which activities should be carried out at the patients bed 3aerosol-generating procedures expose healthcare workers at high risk of contagion 7 aerosol-generating procedures include airway suction bronchoscopy endotracheal intubation tracheostomy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a recent publication the who also includes niv 3 whenever possible these procedures should be performed in negative pressure rooms with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour or at least 160 ls1 per patient in facilities with natural ventilation according to who guidelines 4healthcare workers performing aerosol-generating procedures should wear a waterproof long-sleeved gown double non-sterile gloves eye protection with lateral protection and a respirator that ensures a level of protection equal or greater than n95ffp2 table 2 the document issued by the european centre for disease prevention and control suggests a ffp3 mask for aerosol-generating procedures table 3 5the practical recommendations for critical care and anaesthesiology teams released by a group of canadian anaesthesiologists 18 also suggest the following additional measures for endotracheal intubation
prioritise a planned early intubation rather than an emergency intubation at high risk of contagionif possible avoid bag-mask ventilationensure adequate patient sedationminimise the number of healthcare workers in the room to essential team membersprovide all necessary equipment and medication in the room do not use the crash trolleythis document also suggests wearing a shield visor in addition to protective goggles in order to guarantee double protection canadian anaesthesiologists advice to consider the use of powered air purifying respirators paprs for high-risk procedures figure 1 paprs use a battery-powered fan to conduct air through a filter allowing the wearer to breathe through a mask or a helmet paprs may offer greater protection than ffp2 even if there is no evidence about comparison of these ppes in terms of viral transmission however the use of paprs is burdened by the high costs and communication limits determined by the noise of the fan another risk that must be considered is the high probability of contamination during the undressing procedures which makes it necessary to support healthcare workers with expert staffmore specific precautions are provided by the chinese thoracic society 19 which gives further suggestions for the treatment and ventilatory support of covid-19 patients
do not use humidifiers during conventional oxygen therapythe patient has to wear the surgical mask to reduce contamination risk of the roomduring hfnc treatment ensure correct placement of the nasal cannulas which must be completely inserted in the nostrils and secured with the elastic bands on the patients head in order to minimise lateral losses place a surgical mask over the nasal cannulas figure 2during niv support use a double-limb circuit with a non-vented mask place three filters per ventilator between the expiratory port and the ventilator between the inspiratory port and the ventilator and another filter near the patients mask the interface with the lowest risk of aerosol emission is the helmet equipped with an inflatable neck cushionif bag-mask ventilation is needed place a filter between the bag valve and the maskendotracheal tube to reduce airborne contaminationuse closed circuits in case suction is neededuse ppe during bronchoscopyensure the patient wears a cap that also covers the eyes in order to reduce the risk of face contamination with eye discharge during bronchoscopy place a suction catheter in the patients oral cavity to ensure a local negative pressure that reduces the droplets released by the patient cover the patients mouth with a mask the suction circuit must be closed if patient is supported by niv use the access through the hole on the patients maska shower is recommended after undressing including disinfection of the ears and mouthaccording to evidence approximately 20 of covid-19 patients develop a severe or critical form of disease adult respiratory distress syndrome which in 1932 of cases requires respiratory support treatment 20 oxygen therapy hfnc cpap and niv are noninvasive support methods with a high risk of aerosol dispersion especially in unprotected environments being aware of the exhalation distance of the various methods allows us to favour those with the lowest risk eg helmet with an inflatable neck cushion and to take the necessary precautions eg correct placing of the hfnc despite the high risk of contagion during these procedures evidence suggests that the observance of the indications for the use of ppe are effective in preventing infections among healthcare workers in a casecontrol study conducted during the sars epidemic in hong kong 21 which investigated the effective adhesion of personnel to ppe gloves disposable shirts goggles and masks none of the staff reporting use of all measures contracted the virus while all the infected staff had omitted at least one measure given the high risk of emission of large quantities of droplets aerosol-generating procedures require greater precaution by healthcare personnelthe coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that may cause various symptoms such as pneumonia fever breathing difficulty and lung infection 1 these viruses are common in animals worldwide but very few cases have been known to affect humans the world health organization who used the term 2019 novel coronavirus to refer to a coronavirus that affected the lower respiratory tract of patients with pneumonia in wuhan china on 29 december 2019 24 the who announced that the official name of the 2019 novel coronavirus is coronavirus disease covid-19 4 and the current reference name for the virus is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 it was reported that a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a local huanan south china seafood market in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 5in response to the outbreak the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc dispatched a rapid response team to accompany health authorities of hubei province and wuhan city to conduct epidemiological and etiological investigations the who confirmed that the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic was associated with the huanan south china seafood marketplace but no specific animal association was identified 6 scientists immediately started to research the source of the new coronavirus and the first genome of covid-19 was published by the research team led by prof yong-zhen zhang on 10 january 2020 7 within 1 month this virus spread quickly throughout china during the chinese new year  a period when there is a high level of human mobility among chinese people although it is still too early to predict susceptible populations early patterns have shown a trend similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronaviruses susceptibility seems to be associated with age biological sex and other health conditions 8 covid-19 has now been declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the who 9given the spread of the new coronavirus and its impacts on human health the research community has responded rapidly to the new virus and many preliminary research articles have already been published about this epidemic additional file 1 we conducted a scoping review to summarize and critically analyze all the published scientific articles regarding the new coronavirus in january 2020 this review aims to provide the evidence of early findings on the epidemiology causes clinical diagnosis as well as prevention and control of covid-19 in relation to time location and source of publication this review can provide meaningful information for future research related to this topic and may support government decision-making on strategies to handle this public health emergency at the community national and international levelsa scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by arksey and omalley 10 the following five steps were followed to conduct this scoping review a identifying a clear research objective and search strategies b identifying relevant research articles c selection of research articles d extraction and charting of data and e summarizing discussing analyzing and reporting the resultsliterature for this review was identified by searching the following online databases biorxiv medrxiv chemrxiv google scholar pubmed as well as cnki and wanfang data the two primary databases for biomedical research in mainland china these online databases contain archives of most english and chinese biomedical journals in addition some white papers published online by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china chinese center for disease prevention and control and the who were included in the analysis we searched scientific publications from 1 january to 31 january 2020 the search terms were ncov 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov novel coronavirus pneumonia  chinese  chinese and  chinese we included all the relevant scientific publications written in english or chinese in the review non-scientific commentary reports and news articles were excluded from the analysistwo researchers yw and spa independently searched through the literature the two sets of literature were then compared disagreements on the inclusion or exclusion of literature were resolved through discussion or if necessary by including a third researcher hz to make the final decision duplicate articles were eliminated eventually 65 unique academic publications were included in this analysis additional file 1 figure 1 presents a preferred

we also analyzed the methodological characteristics of the publications in the final sample the majority of the articles are based on mathematical modeling 446 and cross-sectional study designs 185 around half of the studies include targeted populations patients general populations and healthcare workers 492 in their analysis followed by studies that attempt to identify the species of the virus virus structure gene sequence 369 among the 32 articles with population as the target of study 344 had a sample size of less than 10 313 were conducted in a hospital setting and 50 used secondary data quality control activities for data collection were mentioned in 563 of the population studies table 3
on 29 december 2019 the first four cases of an acute respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan city hubei province china among people linked to a local seafood market wet market 2 research is underway to understand more about transmissibility severity and other features associated with covid-19 3 it appears that most of the early cases had some sort of contact history with the original seafood market 2 1214 soon a secondary source of infection was found to be human-to-human transmission via close contact there was an increase of infected people with no history of exposure to wildlife or visiting wuhan and multiple cases of infection were detected among medical professionals 2 1417 it became clear that the covid-19 infection occurs through exposure to the virus and both the immunosuppressed and normal population appear susceptible some studies have reported an age distribution of adult patients between 25 and 89 years old most adult patients were between 35 and 55 years old 14 and there were fewer identified cases among children and infants 14 18 a study on early transmission dynamics of the virus reported the median age of patients to be 59 years ranging from 15 to 89 years with the majority 59 being male 2 it was suggested that the population most at risk may be people with poor immune function such as older people and those with renal and hepatic dysfunction 2the covid-19 has been found to have higher levels of transmissibility and pandemic risk than the sars-cov as the effective reproductive number r of covid-19 29 is estimated to be higher than the reported effective reproduction number r of sars 177 at this early stage 15 different studies of covid-19 have estimated the basic reproduction r0 range to be from 26 to 471 table 4 the average incubation duration of covid-19 was estimated to be 48  26 ranging from 2 to 11 days 15 and 52 days 95 confidence interval 41 to 7 2 the latest guidelines from chinese health authorities stated an average incubation duration of 7 days ranging from 2 to 14 days 23 table 4 summarizes the findings on important indicators from these epidemiological studies
in china 11 791 cases were confirmed and 17 988 cases were suspected in 34 provinces as of 2400 31 january 2020 fig 4 32 studies indicated that the spread of covid-19 was relatively quick and reported that it had spread to several other countries after its outbreak in china on 31 january 2020 there were 213 deaths reported globally 33 confirmed cases were reported in the following 19 countries outside of china australia 9 canada 3 cambodia 1 france 6 finland 1 germany 5 india 1 italy 2 japan 14 nepal 1 malaysia 8 the philippines 1 the republic of korea 11 singapore 13 sri lanka 1 thailand 14 the united states of america 6 united arab emirates 4 and vietnam 5 fig 5 33
coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded rna viruses that are zoonotic in nature and cause symptoms ranging from those similar to the common cold to more severe respiratory enteric hepatic and neurological symptoms 5 34 other than sars-cov-2 there are six known coronaviruses in humans hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 and mers-cov 2 23 35 36 coronavirus has caused two large-scale pandemics in the last two decades sars 37 and mers 12 38to detect the infection source of covid-19 china cdc researchers collected 585 environmental samples from the huanan seafood market in wuhan hubei province china on 1 january and 12 january 2020 they detected 33 samples containing sars-cov-2 and indicated that it originated from wild animals sold in the market 39 then researchers used the lung fluid blood and throat swab samples of 15 patients to conduct laboratory tests these laboratory tests found that the virus-specific nucleic acid sequences in the sample are different from those of known human coronavirus species laboratory results also indicated that sars-cov-2 is similar to some of the beta  coronaviruses genera identified in bats 12 18 40 which is situated in a group of sarssars-like cov 12to conduct next-generation sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates researchers enrolled nine inpatients in wuhan with viral pneumonia and negative in common respiratory pathogens the results of this next-generation sequencing indicated that sars-cov-2 was more distant from sars-cov with about 79 sequence identity and mers-cov with about 50 sequence identity than from two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses  bat-sl-covzc45 with 879 sequence identity and bat-sl-covzxc21 with 872 sequence identity 41 studies also reported that covid-19 s-protein supported strong interaction with human ace2 molecules despite the dissimilarity of its sequence with that of sars-cov 12 42many domestic and wild animals including camels cattle cats and bats may serve as hosts for coronaviruses 23 it is considered that generally animal coronaviruses do not spread among humans 3 however there are exceptions such as sars and mers which are mainly spread though close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets from cough or sneezing with regard to covid-19 early patients were reported to have some link to the huanan seafood market in wuhan china suggesting that these early infections were due to animal-to-person transmission however later cases were reported among medical staff and others with no history of exposure to that market or visiting wuhan which was taken as an indication of human-to-human transmission 2 4 1517the latest guidelines from chinese health authorities 23 43 described three main transmission routes for the covid-19 1 droplets transmission 2 contact transmission and 3 aerosol transmission droplets transmission was reported to occur when respiratory droplets as produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes are ingested or inhaled by individuals nearby in close proximity contact transmission may occur when a subject touches a surface or object contaminated with the virus and subsequently touch their mouth nose or eyes and aerosol transmission may occur when respiratory droplets mix into the air forming aerosols and may cause infection when inhaled high dose of aerosols into the lungs in a relatively closed environment 23 43 in addition to these three routes one study also indicated the digestive system as a potential transmission route for covid-19 infection since patients had abdominal discomfort and diarrhea symptoms researchers analyzed four datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of digestive systems and found that ace2 was highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon 44the complete clinical manifestation is not clear yet as the reported symptoms range from mild to severe with some cases even resulting in death 3 the most commonly reported symptoms are fever cough myalgia or fatigue pneumonia and complicated dyspnea whereas less common reported symptoms include headache diarrhea hemoptysis runny nose and phlegm-producing cough 3 16 patients with mild symptoms were reported to recover after 1 week while severe cases were reported to experience progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the virus which may lead to death 13 cases resulting in death were primarily middle-aged and elderly patients with pre-existing diseases tumor surgery cirrhosis hypertension coronary heart disease diabetes and parkinsons disease 13 case definition guidelines mention the following symptoms fever decrease in lymphocytes and white blood cells new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography and no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotics treatment 2for patients with suspected infection the following procedures have been suggested for diagnosis performing real-time fluorescence rt-pcr to detect the positive nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 in sputum throat swabs and secretions of the lower respiratory tract samples 13 14 43prevention and control strategies and methods are reported at three levels national level case-related population level and general population level at the national level the national health commission of the peoples republic of china issued the no1 announcement on 20 january 2020 which officially included the covid-19 into the management of class b legal infectious diseases and allowed for class a infectious disease preventive and control measures to be implemented 45 under this policy medical institutes can adopt isolation treatment and observation protocols to prevent and control the spread of the covid-19 on 22 january 2020 the national health commission published national guidelines for the prevention and control of covid-19 for medical institutes to prevent nosocomial infection 46 on 28 january 2020 the national health commission issued protocols for rapid prevention and control measures in order to effectively contain the spread of the epidemic through a big isolation and big disinfection policy during the chinese spring festival 47 national-level strategies have also been issued with targeted measures for rural areas issued on 28 january 2020 and the elderly population issued on 31 january 2020 48 49 several public health measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the covid-19 were introduced these include case isolation identification and follow-up of contacts environmental disinfection and use of personal protective equipment 50to date no specific antiviral treatment has been confirmed to be effective against covid-19 regarding patients infected with covid-19 it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care 3 16 there are six clinical trials registered in both the international clinical trials registry platform and the chinese clinical trial registry to evaluate the efficacy or safety of targeted medicine in the treatment or prognosis of covid-19 additional file 2 51 52 regarding infected patients with covid-19 it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care 3 16 studies have also explored the prevention of nosocomial infection and psychological health issues associated with covid-19 a series of measures have been suggested to reduce nosocomial infection including knowledge training for prevention and control isolation disinfection classified protections at different degrees in infection areas and protection of confirmed cases 18 50 53 concerning psychological health some suggested psychological intervention for confirmed cases suspected cases and medical staff 18 54for the general population at this moment there is no vaccine preventing covid-19 the best prevention is to avoid being exposed to the virus 55 airborne precautions and other protective measures have been discussed and proposed for prevention infection preventive and control ipc measures that may reduce the risk of exposure include the following use of face masks covering coughs and sneezes with tissues that are then safely disposed of or if no tissues are available use a flexed elbow to cover the cough or sneeze regular hand washing with soap or disinfection with hand sanitizer containing at least 60 alcohol if soap and water are not available avoidance of contact with infected people and maintaining an appropriate distance as much as possible and refraining from touching eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands 3the who also issued detailed guidelines on the use of face masks in the community during care at home and in the health care settings of covid-19 56 in this document health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certified n95 or ffp2 when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases according to this guideline individuals with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings properly following the infection prevention guidelines according to this guideline an individual without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a medical mask when in public proper use and disposal of masks is important to avoid any increase in risk of transmission 56in addition to articles published in research journals the china cdc published a guideline to raise awareness of the prevention and control of covid-19 among the general population the key messages of the guideline include causes how to choose and wear face masks proper hand washing habits preventive measures at different locations eg at home on public transportation and in public space disinfection methods and medical observation at home 57 in addition to scientific knowledge on ways to handle the covid-19 outbreak the guideline also suggests ways to eliminate panic among the general population 57the review applied a systematic and rigorous search strategy to retrieve relevant articles according to the research objectives this research summarizes scientific foundations identifies literature gaps and suggests some evidence for future research directions on covid-19 which will provide information for research community policymakers and health professionals to adjust andor come up with new research policies and practices our study only focuses on the articles published either in english or in chinese during the early outbreak period although it cannot reflect the entire body of research on covid-19 worldwide it will provide some evidences for future study and controlthis study shows a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of covid-19 during this early period many studies have been published exploring the epidemiology causes clinical manifestation and diagnosis and prevention and control of the novel coronavirus thus far most studies have focused on the epidemiology and potential causes however studies exploring prevention and control measures have begun to gradually increase studies in this domain are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the outbreak government agencies have quickly incorporated recent scientific findings into public policies at the community regional and national levels to slow down andor prevent the further spread of the covid-19 we recommend that the scholarly community conduct further research to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short-term and long-termpatients with newly diagnosed covid-19 who were hospitalized singly in aiirs with separate toilet and shower facilities and who consented to participate in air sample collection were recruited to increase the proportion of exhaled air sampled and to reduce the proportion of environmental air from the air conditioning system with 12 air changes per hour an umbrella fitted with transparent plastic curtain was used as an air shelter to cover patients during sample collection supplementary fig 1ad online air samples of patients inside this air shelter were collected using the sartorius md8 airscan sampling device sartorius ag germany with sterile gelatin filters 80 mm in diameter and 3 m pore size type 17528-80-acd sartorius ag briefly the air sampler was perpendicularly positioned 10 cm away from the patients chin at a rate of 50 l per minute 1000 l of air was collected by each gelatin filter for 20 minutes while patients were with or without a surgical mask that complies with the astm f2100 level 1 standard patients 16 were chosen as cases to detect whether sars-cov-2 rna was present in the air as positive controls covid-19 patients were instructed to sneeze directly onto the gelatin filter used for the air sampler and to spit saliva droplets onto the gelatin filter patients 710 were chosen as positive controls and patient 6 served as both a case and his own control after air sampling or collecting the positive controls each gelatin filter was soaked into 5 ml viral transport medium vtm and incubated at 37c for 10 minutes after dissolution of the gelatin filter 1 ml vtm was collected for nucleic acid extraction as we described previously13swab samples from the patients environment including bed rail locker bed table toilet door handle and the patients mobile phone were collected for sars-cov-2 viral load assay before daily environmental disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solution 1000 ppm briefly swab samples covering a mean surface area of 9 cm2 3 cm  3 cm for bed rail locker and bed table and the entire surfaces of toilet door handles and patients mobile phones were collected swabs were then submerged in 2 ml vtm each swab sample in vtm was vortexed and centrifuged at 13000  g for 1 minute and 1 ml of the supernatant was used for nucleic acid extractionthe nasopharyngeal flocked swab and deep throat saliva of patients were collected on the day of environmental sampling and were subjected to viral load assay if other clinical samples such as throat swab sputum andor rectal swab were collected the results were used to correlate with the results of environmental sampling the clinical sample with the highest viral load from each patient was selected for correlation with the positivity rate of their own environmental samplesthe viral load assay of air and environmental samples is illustrated in supplementary file 1 online the correlation experiment between viral load and plaque-forming units was performed in triplicate the rationale and technical details of performing this experiment are described in supplementary file 1this study was approved by the institutional review board of the university of hong konghospital authority hong kong west hospital clusterstatistical analyses were performed using the spearman rank test using xlstat software addinsoft new york ny p  005 was considered statistically significantfrom january 24 2020 to april 9 2020 clinical samples were collected from 6 hospitalized patients on the same day of their air sampling except for 1 asymptomatic patient with low viral load 207  101 copiesml in deep throat saliva collected in the early morning the other 5 patients patient 1 and patients 36 had viral loads between 330  106 and 917  107 copiesml table 1 the results of patient 1 were reported previously14 however all of the air samples from these 6 patients collected inside the air shelter were negative for sars-cov-2 rna by rt-pcr including 1 patient patient 6 who was put on high-flow oxygen of 100 in the icu at the time of air sampling collection patients 610 positive controls were instructed to sneeze and spit saliva droplets directly onto the gelatin filters used in the air sampler with the exception of patient 6 who had a viral load of 254  104 copiesml in the gelatin filter during sneezing the sneezing samples onto the gelatin filters were negative for sars-cov-2 rna the saliva droplets directly spitted on gelatin filters of patients 610 were all positive for sars-cov-2 rna table 1from february 28 2020 to march 22 2020 a total of 377 environmental samples from aiirs housing 21 rt-pcrconfirmed covid-19 patients were collected during 76 room visits before daily environmental disinfection the median frequency of environmental sample collection per single room was 3 range 18 of these 76 room visits for environmental sample collection at least 1 environmental site positive for sars-cov-2 in 13 room visits 172 in total 19 of 377 samples 50 were rt-pcr positive patients mobile phones had highest rate of contamination followed by bed rails and toilet door handles table 2 of these 19 environmental samples positive for sars-cov-2 the median viral load was 92  102 copiesml range 11  102 to 94  104 copiesml the correlation between viral loads in clinical samples of patients and environmental samples is illustrated in figure 1 but it did not reach statistical significance p  908 spearman   0029 we then divided patients into groups based on viral load in clinical samples and assessed environmental contamination rates in each group fig 2 environmental sample positivity was only observed in patients with clinical samples having a viral load 103 copiesml we detected a positive correlation between patient viral load up to 9 log copiesml and positivity rate of environmental samples p  001 spearman   0090the correlation experiment between viral load and plaque-forming units was performed in triplicate and is illustrated in supplementary table 1 online using the rna-dependent rna polymerase gene as the target 1 plaque-forming unit was equivalent to 167  104  443  103 copiesmlin this study we could not demonstrate the presence of sars-cov-2 in air samples collected 10 cm from a patients chin with or without a surgical mask in a single aiir setting even among symptomatic patients with high viral loads and in a patient receiving high-flow oxygen in the icu our finding is consistent with the initial observation reported in singapore where all air samples had no detectable sars-cov-2 inside the isolation room including air samples collected when the sampler was placed next to patients heads12 although sars-cov-2 was identified in 2 of 3 air outlet fan next to patients heads the level of these fans whether at the roof or ground level was not specified an air outlet fan located at ground level may be easily contaminated by respiratory droplets instead of airborne aerosols sars-cov-2 was detected in the air samples collected in the patients area in the icu in wuhan china10 to interpret these apparently discordant findings we must note that there is no standardized method for collecting air samples for virological investigation15 different models of air samplers and protocols were used in our study and the other 2 previous studies more importantly the rates of collection and the total volumes of air collected were also different in our study we collected a total of 1000 l of air at a rate of 50 l per minute for 20 minutes per sample table 3 the study from singapore was conducted in a single room with negative pressure setting similar ours and 1200 l of air at a rate of 5 l per minute was collected which required 4 hours per air sample collection in the study from wuhan china a total of 9000 l of air at a rate of 300 l per minute was collected for 30 minutes per air sample within the icu housing 15 patients and also in a general ward housing 24 patients the presence of sars-cov-2 in their air samples may be attributed to a larger volume of 9000 l of air being collected in both the icu and the general ward the higher rates of positive air samples in icus than that in general wards may be related to the performance of aerosol-generating procedures in icus especially in an icu with an open-cubicle design this situation is similar to the occurrence of opportunistic airborne transmission leading to the sars outbreak in icu in 200316we have no doubt that the air around covid-19 patients may contain sars-cov-2 as extrapolated from a study on respiratory viruses including common coldrelated human coronaviruses from the exhaled breath directly from the infected patients17 in this study using a g-ii bioaerosol collecting device exhaled breath particles were directly captured and differentiated into 2 size fractions including respiratory droplets of particles with aerodynamic diameter 5 m and aerosols of particles 5 m among the exhaled air samples collected without a face mask 6 of 10 participants 60 with common cold coronavirus infection did not shed detectable virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols only 4 patients had detectable virus at low median viral load 03 log10 virus copies per sample assuming that the tidal volume of a young adult is 500 ml and that the average respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute the total volume of exhaled air is 8 l per minute which totals 240 l per 30 minutes given the median viral load of coronavirus of 03 log10 virus copies per each exhaled breath sample collected for 30 minutes the concentration of viral rna per liter of exhaled air becomes negligible 000125 copies per liter of air17 in 2 studies including our study of air sampling from covid-19 patients the air samples were not completely composed of exhaled breath but of a mixture of both room air and exhaled air from patients1012 therefore negative sars-cov-2 rna findings might be expected in volumes of 10001200 l of air samples in aiirs even though we used an umbrella with curtain to reduce the dilution effect of air inside the aiirs it was not sufficient to improve the yield of sars-cov-2 detectionsuccessful infection by sars-cov-2 depends on the dose of viral exposure and the host immunity in a murine model the infectious dose of 2003 sars-cov was estimated to be 43280 plaque-forming units18 based on our experiment 1 plaque-forming unit is equivalent to a mean of 167  104 virus genome copiesml assuming that the infectious dose of sars-cov-2 is similar to that of sars-cov or common cold coronaviruses the susceptible individual may need to stay with a covid-19 case for 195 years to obtain enough virus inoculum as extrapolated from the exhaled breath virus concentration detected by g-ii bioaerosol collecting device similarly a susceptible patient needs to stay in a wuhan icu for 445 days to become infected theoretically supplementary table 2 online provided that the other routes of transmission are absent in fact prolonged exposure in the same confined environment was also required for animal-to-animal transmission as illustrated in our caged hamster experiment19 we only collected air samples from 6 patients with a total collection time of 2 hours when they were not wearing a surgical mask thus we cannot completely exclude the possibility of a single erratic event of high virus inoculum being shed by the covid-19 patients when a longer period of sampling is performed our previous study showed that wearing of a surgical mask by either patients or healthcare workers prevented nosocomial transmission of influenza during the pandemic of influenza a h1n1 virus in 200920 recently we also demonstrated that community-wide wearing of face masks could minimize the transmission of covid-19 in hong kong21 our present findings may also support the usefulness of wearing surgical masks by patients in minimizing environmental contamination by their own respiratory droplets and salivaalthough we are puzzled by the study showing that wearing surgical masks by patients infected with common cold coronaviruses could prevent their exhalation of virus-laden aerosols of particles 5 m it is possible that the filtration mechanism of a surgical mask may be sufficient prevent the transmission of such small-sized particles with coronavirus when their number is low however the use of a face mask to prevent dispersal of sars-cov-2 was challenged by a recent study on 4 patients who were instructed to cough directly onto a petri dish containing vtm which was placed at 20 cm from the patients mouth with or without surgical or cotton mask22 in this study the shedding of virus was sporadic in 1 patient who coughed without wearing face mask only 1 of 2 coughing episodes yielded detectable sars-cov-2 rna notably the viral load in the vtm exposed to coughing from patients was highest when patient was coughing without mask 256 log copiesml followed by coughing with surgical mask 242 log copiesml and coughing with cotton mask 185 log copiesml these findings suggest that cotton masks may offer better or similar protection as surgical masks surprisingly no sars-cov-2 rna was detected in 3 of 4 surface swabs collected from inner sides of a surgical mask and a cotton mask even though 3 of 4 patients produced detectable viral rna in the petri dish placed 20 cm from patients mouth whether such apparently discrepant findings can be explained by complicated aerodynamics deserves further investigationbecause covid-19 is predominantly transmitted through droplet and contact routes droplet and contact precautions should have overriding importance the hong kong special administrative region is one of the very few areas where community-wide wearing of face mask was practiced from the beginning of this covid-19 epidemic21 we promoted proactive infection control measures in the hospitals with enforcement of hand hygiene practice and environmental cleaning1423 and all hospitalized patients were provided with surgical masks as source control to reduce the amount of environmental contamination14 however the mandatory use of surgical masks by hospitalized patients in studies from singapore and china was not mentioned1012 in addition we have been promoting hand hygiene among our hospitalized patients2426 therefore our single-room environment with confirmed cases of covid-19 was significantly less contaminated than that in singapore and wuhan china of our 377 environmental samples collected before daily cleaning and disinfection only 5 were positive for sars-cov-2 rna compared with 1085 in hospitals in singapore and wuhan china1012 moreover we showed that the higher viral load of patients clinical samples correlated with the likelihood of environmental contamination when the viral load of clinical samples was 3 log copiesml environmental contamination with sars-cov-2 could be detected among all sampled items and locations patients mobile phones were the most frequently contaminated item this personal electronic device is not routinely disinfected by the hospital cleaning team this finding has implications for the disinfection policy of commonly shared electronic devices for patient care in the hospital ultraviolet c light-emitting disinfecting device specifically designed for electronic mobile device was advocated during this pandemic2728 the bed rail was another item highly contaminated with sars-cov-2 that is frequently touched by both patients and healthcare workers as illustrated previously29 therefore enforcement of hand hygiene in healthcare workers and patients remains the cornerstone of infection control2426 especially during the covid-19 pandemic30 correct wearing of a surgical mask diligent practice of hand hygiene and thorough environmental disinfection should be sufficient for the prevention of covid-19 in the hospital setting except during aerosol-generating procedures or when high numbers of covid-19 patients are concentrated in a cohort wardthis study has several limitations first the patient number was low the total process of air sampling including the preparation and instructions to patient took at least 2 hours per patient thus some patients refused to join the study second the temporal fluctuations of a patients viral load the performance of aerosol-generating procedures and the immunity of susceptible person were not included in the calculation of the infectious virus dose further investigations of the complicated aerodynamics of the sars-cov-2-laden aerosols especially in the cohort ward setting or during aerosol-generating procedures should be performedthe consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov 2 which was originated in wuhan region of china and spread all over the world have influenced all stages of health services eventually world health organization who11httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 has declared pandemic for this virus this pandemic is accepted as a viral pneumonia pandemic not a simple flu therefore intensive care unit icu admission follow-up and management of the critically ill patients with covid-19 is extremely important due to the paucity of studies on covid-19 suggestions are generally within the framework of the experiences gained from china italy usa and uk that have the biggest war against this disease in this review we summarized the essential points of icu management for covid-19 patients1the need for intensive care might differ according to institutions or even countries depending on the demand and supply ranging from 5 to 32 13 severe disease may present with severe acute respiratory infection sari ie severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which is reported in 6070 of patients sepsis and septic shock reported in 30 myocarditis arrhythmia and cardiogenic shock in 2030 and acute kidney injury in 1030 of patients 4 although respiratory failure is often hypoxemic hypercapnic respiratory failure might also be seen mainly due to mucus plugs there is a male dominance with male to female ratio being 21 in severe cases whereas according to a recent data from italy 82 of patients were male although hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common reported comorbidities advanced age is also a risk factor for the development of severe disease 5 the main icu admission indications according to turkish guidelines22httpshsgmsaglikgovtrdepocovid19rehberlercovid-19rehberipdf turkish public health general directorate guidelines which are prepared according to covid-19 advisory committee proposals are shown in table patients who are hemodynamically stable and do not need advanced respiratory and organ support anymore might be transferred to wards 6 the median time between the initiation of clinical signs to the development of pneumonia is about 5 days and the median icu admission time after development of hypoxemia is about 712 days 1 icu mortality due to covid-19 varies from 16 to 78 according to different studies 2579 the current reported mortality rate was 26 in a recent multicentre study from italy however 58 of patients were still in icu and only 16 of patients were able to be discharged which means mortality rate could be higher 3 older age presence of comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic lung disease cancer higher d-dimer and c-reactive protein and lower lymphocyte levels are associated with higher mortality 4 in part of a pandemic plan of the country and hospitals icu beds should be organized as well as all devices equipment and personnel it is appropriate to reserve some icus for covid-19 patients if this is not possible patient cohorts should be done within the icu patients should be followed in isolated rooms necessary personnel protective equipment ppe should be provided and a dedicated team for covid icu should be organised for this purpose patient to nurse ratio could be 11 if possible a stand-by clean medical team may also be considered this team can work in other icus it is recommended to change the team that takes care of covid-19 patients in every 14 days hereby a wash-out period is provided it is also suggested that health care workers should not work for longer than 12 h a day in order to minimise risk of infection they must be warned that the whole team should report their body temperature and symptoms twice a day and they will not leave the city during rest periods 10 it should be considered that the existing intensive care beds and organization may not be sufficient due to the pandemic potential solutions are expanding intensive care outside icus like high-dependency units general wards postanaesthesia care units and even operating rooms on the other hand surging in the icu capacity brings an incremental demand for equipment such as ventilators consumable materials therapeutics and as well as human force as healthcare workers hcw for this purpose elective in-patient admissions and surgeries should be delayed and available wards could be adapted for stepping down other icu patients in order to evacuate icus another point is to increase hcw trained in intensive care therefore hcw who are currently working out of icu should be systematically trained in terms of covid-19 protocol for supporting icu staff 11 to ensure proper infection control measures in the icu are crucial contact and droplet isolation precautions should be undertaken33government of canada infection prevention and control for novel coronavirus 2019-ncov interim guidance for acute

but it seems reasonable to use in order to decline the viral transmission it is more convenient for prolonged resuscitations 12 hypoxemic respiratory failure should be recognized early despite conventional oxygen therapy increased work of breathing and hypoxemia could become progressively worse supplemental oxygen should be given via low-flow o2 delivery systems such as nasal cannula 1-6

venturi and diffuser masks are suggested to be avoided it should be remembered that fio2  060 for  6 h might create o2 toxicity hfno therapy and nimv support may be applied in selected hypoxemic respiratory failure cases with proper ppe because of high risk of aerosol generation however these patients should be followed closely in terms of clinical deterioration if no positive response is obtained in the first few hours refractory hypoxemia tachypnoea tidal volume vt  9 mlkg meaning increased minute ventilation and work of breathing when applying nimv a helmet mask may be used applied with intensive care ventilators or dual-circuit ventilators a viralbacterial filter should be added to the circuit nimv should not be applied to patients whose secretions cannot be controlled who have high aspiration risk impaired mental status cardiac complications and multiple organ failure and who are hemodynamically unstable 13 prolonged spontaneous breathing may cause uncontrolled intrathoracic negative pressures and induce patient-self-inflicted lung injury similar to ventilator induced lung injury and therefore must be prevented by utilization of intubation as soon as possible 14 almost 10 of patients may require invasive mechanical ventilation endotracheal intubation should be applied by a trained and most experienced physician with a rapid sequential intubation protocol intubation should be performed with video-laryngoscope if possible intubation with flexible bronchoscopy can be used in difficult intubation however bronchoscopy is a high-risk procedure for aerolisation use of bag-mask ventilation should be avoided during preoxygenation preoxygenation could be performed with nonrebreather mask with reservoir if bag-mask would be used a filter should be attached to the bag mask neuromuscular blockers can be administered to suppress cough before intubation positive pressure ventilation should not be initiated before the endotracheal cuff is inflated and patients must be connected to mechanical ventilator directly without bag ventilation 15 closed system aspiration should be provided and bacterialviral filters should be placed in both inspiratory and expiratory ports of the ventilator for airway humidification heat and moisture exchanger hme filter could be used unless absolutely necessary bronchoscopic procedures should be avoided and metered dose inhaler mdi should be preferred instead of nebulization for bronchodilator therapy however due to mucus plugs and increased resistance and dead-space ventilation active heated humidifier hh can be preferred77httpshsgmsaglikgovtrdepocovid19rehberlercovid-19rehberipdf in patients developing ards low tidal volumes 46 mlkg and low inspiratory pressures plateau pressure  30 cm h2o driving

hypercapnia despite sedation in moderate to severe ards with ventilator dyssnchrony and in the first 2448 h of mechanical ventilation in patients with pao2fio2  150 more than 12 h of prone position could be applied daily in patients who are managed by conventional mv interventions prone position has been demonstrated to be helpful even in spontaneously breathing nonintubated patients even with nimv and hfno inhaled nitric oxide no administration could be used as a rescue therapy and could also theoretically be helpful to improve ventilationperfusion match since it has been speculated that perfusion is also impaired in ards due to covid-19 and these patients have preserved compliance routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended 17 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo may be considered in patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung-protective ventilation and appropriate patients should be referred to experienced centres due to paucity of evidence for this virus and disease pathophysiology probable advantages of ecmo is ambiguous ecmo is not a therapy that should be considered in case of a major pandemic regarding the appropriate allocation of resources 18dr gattinoni and his colleagues suggested that covid-19 patients with respiratory failure have 2 phenotypes 19 phenotype characterized by low elastance high compliance so called type l has low ventilator perfusion ratio low lung weight and low recruitability whereas type h characterized by high elastance low compliance has high right-to-left shunt high lung weight and high recruitability severe hypoxemia for high compliant lungs may be elucidated by the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction they recommend to increase fio2 as a solution for hypoxemia for those who are not experiencing dyspnoea in which type l patient responds well early intubation may even cause transition to type h phenotype however for intubated hypercapnic type l patients ventilation with more than 6 mlkg up to 89 mlkg does not bring risk of ventilator-associated lung injury since type l phenotypes could have a tolerance in terms of mechanical power by the help of high compliance furthermore administration of high peep for nonrecruitable lungs may cause hemodynamic impairment and fluid retention as well type h phenotype looks like usual severe ards therefore higher peep prone positioning and even extracorporeal support are classical therapeutic choices this suggestion has not been proved in large scale studies and postponing intubation in severe hypoxemia and increased work of breathing might be detrimental and early intubation in patients unresponsive to conventional o2 treatment and perhaps short course of nimv and hfno is recommended during weaning from mechanical ventilation patients under very low or no sedation should be evaluated for readiness as such decreased o2 requirement fio2  040 peep  8 cm h2o hemodynamic stability acceptable consciousness with preserved gag and cough reflex rapid shallow breathing index could be checked so that patients with respiratory rate to tidal volume ratio  100 have high likelihood of being successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation instead of weaning trial through t-piece weaning from pressure support ventilation could be chosen due to less aerosol generation in covid-19 patients high mucus plugs are being reported therefore to reduce the risk of reintubation timing of weaning and extubation should be individualized whether the cuff leak test should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear if postextubation stridor is highly expected female sex fluid overload prolonged intubation  57 days age  80 years large endotracheal tubes  885 f difficult and traumatic intubation cuff-leak test could be performed weighing against risks andor corticosteroids could be given during extubation if possible extubation should be performed in airborne isolation rooms with maximum ppe use for postextubation respiratory failure nimv andor hfno should be applied very carefully in selected patients and if there is stridor immediate intubation should be performed for patients who fail weaning a tracheostomy may be indicated which is considered to be a high-risk procedure for aerosolization 20 patients should receive pulmonary and extremity rehabilitation especially when they have low risk

patients the needfulness of intensive care units with well-organized structure and trained hcw has emerged once again intensive care science plays a locomotive role in this kind of outbreak management the contribution of intensivists who are dealing with complex organ failures is very important in the training of healthcare professionals for outbreak planning providing the emotional support of hcw while organising these plans increasing the motivation by using the available communication tools is crucial to prevent burnout by minimizing fear and anxiety 5akn kaya is a member of covid-19 advisory committee of ministry of health of turkey arzu topeli is a member of covid-19 advisory committee of ministry of health of turkeythe emergence and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has resulted in tens of thousands of pneumonia cases both inside and outside hubei province china although the general population is commonly susceptible to the disease infected elderly people show fast progression and severe manifestations with a high proportion in a critical condition as a result of compromised immunity and underlying diseases the notice on the prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak among the elderly issued by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china clearly states that due to the high proportion of critically ill patients among the elderly infection prevention and control should be regarded as an important mission at present to do our best to reduce critical illness and death cases
1
 therefore in order to improve the quality of nursing reduce complications decrease mortality of critically ill elderly patients and provide guidance for clinical practice we assembled a national expert group with expertise in critical nursing to write this consensus based on a literature review firstline clinical experiences and a subsequent panel discussionnurses should properly arrange critically ill elderly patients with covid19 and complete the evaluation in the shortest time possible in the meanwhile urgent care such as wheelchairflatbed transfer oxygen inhalation electrocardiogram monitoring sputum suction and establishment of venous access should be completedthe general condition assessment should include age present history illness past medical history allergic history vital signs oxygen saturation breath consciousness state and systemic symptoms such as fever cough expectoration chest congestion hypodynamia muscle soreness and diarrhea the selfcare ability assessment should include the barthel index for activities of daily living
2
 according to which patients can be categorized into four grades total independence score 100 mild dependence score between 61 and 90 moderate dependence score between 41 and 60 and severe dependence score 40 nurses should determine the nursing grades according to the patients degree of dependence to provide appropriate nursing care the specialized assessment should include cognitive functional assessment nutritional status assessment and venous thromboembolism vte risk assessment the minicog test
3
 is recommended for the evaluation of cognitive function as it is brief minimally influenced by language and education level and easily accepted by patients the nutrition risk in critically ill nutric scale may be used to evaluate the nutritional status of critically ill elderly patients
4
 however considering elderly patients are prone to suffering from malnutrition nutritional support should be provided immediately after admission in the case of insufficient medical staff vte risk assessment varies depending on different clinical situations for medical patients the padua scale is recommended while for surgical patients the caprini risk assessment model is recommended

dynamically monitor patients vital signs focusing on temperature respiratory rhythm rate depth and spo2 for patients with fever antipyretic treatment should be performed according to the doctors advice after the use of antipyretic drugs changes in temperature and sweating should be closely monitored moreover for patients who sweat a lot nurses should dry the sweat as soon as possible change their clothes and bed units and encourage them to drink more water if necessary report to the doctor for timely fluid rehydration in addition according to the respiratory patterns oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas analysis results determine patients blood oxygenation statuses and promptly correct hypoxemiadynamically monitor water electrolytes acidbase balance and infection indicators of patients to determine the occurrence of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis once any complications occur nursing routines and measures of corresponding complications should be implementedobserve patients consciousness states and systemic symptoms such as cough expectoration chest tightness dyspnea and cyanosis once the patient has the above symptoms implement oxygen therapy following the doctors advice and observe the effect the patients condition should be reported to the doctor in time to adjust the oxygen flow rate or oxygen therapy method also the 24hour intake and output volume should be recorded in the nursing documentfor elderly patients special attention should be paid to strengthen the observation and nursing of their underlying diseases and monitor relevant indicators such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease
when nasal catheter oxygen inhalation is used the oxygen flow rate is generally 5 lmin disposable nasal oxygen catheters and humidification devices are recommended the front end of the nasal oxygen catheter should be placed in the patients nostril with a depth of 15 cm and the patient should wear a surgical mask to prevent aerosol diffusion
4
 a waterbased lubricant can be used if the nasal mucosa is dry but not petroleum jelly or other oilbased agents when mask oxygen inhalation is used the oxygen flow rate is usually set at 510 lmin and disposable nasal oxygen catheters and humidification devices are recommended the mask should completely cover the patients nose and mouth to reduce aerosol diffusion but a surgical mask is not necessary
6
 during oxygen inhalation by nasal catheter or mask the patients breath and oxygen saturation should be closely observed and arterial blood gas analysis should be implemented if necessary if oxygen therapy persistently fails to reach the target or carbon dioxide retention occurs nurses should inform the doctor immediately and change oxygen therapy methods if necessaryin order to reduce the diffusion of aerosol and droplets when starting hfnc the operation should be conducted in the following sequence 1 start up 2 set initial parameters 3 fit the nasal plug to the patient and 4 deliver oxygen when stopping the sequence of operation is to shut down or reduce the oxygen flow to zero and then remove the nasal plug considering that critically ill elderly patients with covid19 may get worse at any time when hfnc is used or stopped the oxygen supply should not be interrupted and some necessary devices needed for nasal catheter oxygen inhalation noninvasive ventilator or trachea intubation should be prepared in advance according to the condition keep the device and pipeline at or below the level of the patients head to avoid choking or asphyxiation caused by backflow of the condensation in the pipeline in the process of hfnc pay close attention to the application effect if there is no improvement in oxygenation indicators or if they deteriorate after 2 hours of use the doctor should be informed immediately and a change to noninvasive mechanical ventilation should be considered
4

before initiating noninvasive mechanical ventilation patients should be fully informed to eliminate resistance and so they can be taught to inhale through the nose in order to reduce aerosol diffusion an oralnasal mask is recommended but not a nose mask if conditions permit a disposable breathing valve is recommended instead of a maskintegrated valve and platform valve filters can be added between the mask and the breathing valve and having the vantage facing the operator should be avoided
7
 in the process of using adjust the parameters of inspired positive airway pressure expired positive airway pressure and oxygen concentration according to the doctors advice and closely observe the patients consciousness oxygenation patientventilator synchrony and improvement of respiratory function if the condition does not improve in a short time or signs of deterioration such as consciousness disorders or coma occur the doctor should be informed immediately and a change to invasive mechanical ventilation should be consideredit is recommended that patients with nasal trachea cannula or tracheotomy should wear surgical masks to avoid aerosol diffusion disposable respiratory loops are recommended and regular replacement is not recommended unless contamination is apparent
7
 pay close attention to ventilator operation oxygenation index pipe fixation of trachea cannula or tracheotomy and sputum drainage during use if endotracheal suction is required closed endotracheal suction systems should be selected see airway management section below for details as elderly patients are prone to comorbid ventilatorassociated pneumonia when using noninvasive mechanical ventilation the head of the bed must be raised by 3045 the condensate must be removed regularly and disposed of in accordance with infectious body fluids during the process of disposal the accidental spilling or backflow of the condensate into the airway of the patient should be avoided

during the operation of ecmo the patients condition hemodynamic changes vital signs oxygen saturation arterial blood gas central venous pressure and other indicators should be closely observed and if possible invasive blood pressure should be continuously monitored radiator temperature speed of pump and auxiliary flow can be adjusted according to the indicators monitor the coagulation function according to the doctors advice every day adjust the dosage of heparin pay close attention to the operation of the machine and observe whether there is abnormal vibration translocation looseness curve traction and whether there is air intake and thrombus in the pipelinepostural drainage regular turning over and patting of the back can be used to help patients with secretion retention or difficulty in sputum excretion a vibrating sputum extractor should be avoided as much as possible so as not to cause the risk of blood oxygen saturation decline and arrhythmia during sputum excretion nurses should pay attention to the patients complaint of discomfort and immediately monitor the changes of vital signs and blood oxygen saturationatomization treatment is a highrisk procedure for suspected or confirmed patients with covid19 therefore this procedure should be performed in a wellventilated room with a minimum number of people that can meet the patients care needs
8
 avoid using a smallvolume nebulizer which easily causes aerosol diffusion as much as possible atomization devices such as atomized drug storage devices breathing pipes and atomized masks should be disposableduring invasive noninvasive or artificial airway ventilation airway humidification can reduce the inflammatory response caused by mechanical ventilation for reasonable airway humidification one should avoid excessive or insufficient humidification it is necessary to implement sputum suction immediately according to the characteristic changes of airway secretions to prevent the occurrence of emergencies such as sputum obstruction and suffocationfor patients with artificial airways closed endotracheal suction systems should be used strictly following the principle of sputum suction on demand to avoid constant suction leading to severe cough airway wall mucosal edema or even bleeding
6
 shallow sputum suction is recommended and patients should be given 2 minutes of pure oxygen before that in addition each sputum suction duration should be 15 seconds and continuous negative pressure suction should be applied with pressure maintained between 80 mmhg and 150 mmhg 1 mmhg  0133 kpa the closed tracheal suction catheter should be changed every 72 hours to reduce further infection caused by colonization of the tip bacteriaantiviral drugs should be given to patients according to the doctors advice considering that lopinavirritonavir may cause diarrhea nausea vomiting liver injury myocardial injury and other adverse reactions special attention should be paid to monitoring the liver function cardiac function of patients during the clinical application and gastrointestinal reactions that may occur requiring symptomatic treatment and careglucocorticoids treatment should be performed in strict accordance with the prescribed dose frequency and duration of medication and the dosage should be reduced gradually according to symptoms and body temperature attention should be paid to observe the occurrence of any drugrelated adverse reactions such as secondary infection ulcers hypertension blood glucose increase and blood potassium decreaseduring the application of antibiotics it is necessary to observe the occurrence of intestinal flora disorders drug allergic reactions fungal infections and so forth and to deal with possible adverse drugrelated reactions according to the doctors advicepatients can be treated with human immunoglobulin according to the doctors advice for patients with rapid progression severe or critical disease convalescent plasma therapy may be used

 during the use it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of transfusion reaction and observe the curative effectcritically ill elderly patients with covid19 are prone to dyspnea andor hypoxemia due to the combination of multiple underlying diseases and severe cases may rapidly progress to ards when patients with moderate or severe ards need to be treated with invasive mechanical ventilation combined with a prone position the nurse should follow the standard operating procedure of the prone position and change the body position by axial rotation meanwhile complications such as pressure injury falling off the bed pipeline slipoff and eye compression should be prevented those patients with poor efficacy should receive ecmo treatment as soon as possiblethe occurrence of acute left heart failure and myocardial injury should be monitored vigilantly in elderly patients under a variety of pathogenic factors especially for elderly patients with underlying heart disease it is necessary to be cautious about fluid supplementation to avoid large amounts of rapid fluid supplementation leading to acute left heart failure nurses should pay close attention to changes in breathing blood pressure heart rate and heart rhythm of elderly patients and promptly identify symptoms such as dyspnea severe wheezing arrhythmia and decreased blood pressure in addition relevant laboratory tests of btype brain natriuretic peptide electrolytes and markers of myocardial injury should be conducted and active treatment should be coordinated with doctors furthermore adjust the patients position maintain unobstructed venous access and use drugs in accordance with the doctors advice rescue supplies and medicines should be prepared and kept by highrisk patients bedstreatment with antiinfective drugs and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of acute kidney injury in elderly patients with covid19 when early kidney injury manifestations such as decreased urine volume facial edema and limb edema appear it is necessary to communicate with the doctor immediately to adjust the treatment plan during the oliguria phase the infusion volume and drip rate should be controlled 30 dropsmin and attention should be paid to the occurrence of hyperkalemia during the polyuria phase the patients vital signs consciousness appetite and skin elasticity should be closely observed and oral rehydration salts can be used to maintain electrolyte balance in the course of treatment daily living nursing should be strengthened to keep the perineum clean and reduce the possibility of urinary system infectionthe risk of vte in elderly patients with severe disease is significantly increased due to the combination of the release of a large number of inflammatory mediators the application of hormones and immunoglobulin resulting in high blood coagulation coupled with mechanical ventilation and central venous catheterization surgery and other operations leading to vascular endothelial injury therefore all critically ill elderly patients with covid19 should be treated with vte prevention if there are no contraindications
5
 prevention of vte usually includes subcutaneous injection of anticoagulant prophylaxis and mechanical prophylaxis intermittent pneumatic booster pump prophylaxis during the use of anticoagulant drugs the risk of vte and bleeding must be dynamically assessed in particular it is necessary to observe whether there is any bleeding or abnormal coagulation function after the use of anticoagulant drugs once any abnormal situation occurs immediately inform the doctor to stop the drug and deal with itbecause the skin of the elderly is atrophic and thin and the senses are insensitive it is necessary to strengthen the skin care of elderly patients to prevent pressure injury for patients with oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation the skin blood circulation of the face in contact with the mask or catheter should be regularly observed and preventive dressings such as foam dressings should be used to provide protection when necessary to avoid pressure injuries on the nose face lips and behind the ears patients with diarrhea frequent stools or incontinence need to be alert to the occurrence of incontinent dermatitis when antipyretic drugs are required suppositories should be used less frequently to reduce the risk of skin damagesome patients with covid19 have symptoms similar to intracranial infections such as headache epilepsy and disturbance of consciousness and some even take intracranial infection as the first symptom therefore the nurse should closely observe the patients neurological symptoms and if necessary and according to the doctors advice give sedative and analgesic drugs and give reasonable physical restraints so as to ensure the patients life and safety of treatment and nursingit is important to provide patients with oral care nursing of various pipelines and defecation and urination nursing strictly implement the aseptic operation and disinfection and isolation standards to prevent ventilatorrelated pneumonia catheterrelated bloodstream infection catheterrelated urinary tract infection and other secondary infections1 for patients who can eat by mouth dietary nutritional education should be done to inform patients of the importance of a reasonable diet in promoting rehabilitation and to obtain the maximum degree of cooperation from the patients 2 a highprotein carbohydraterich diet is recommended especially for the elderly easily digestible food is recommended 3 close attention should be paid to the nutritional status of patients and nutritional indicators such as albumin and ferritin should be monitored when oral feeding fails to meet the 60 target energy requirements of patients en should be started as soon as possible
10

1 for patients with en by nasogastric tube the temperature of the nutrient solution should be maintained at 38c42c and continuous and uniform pumping is recommended starting at 2030 mlh and increasing by 10 mlh after 2 hours if no retention until 60100 mlh
10
 it is recommended that gastric residual volume be monitored every 4 hours for gastric retention
11
 2 during the en process patients should be observed for the presence of symptoms of gastrointestinal intolerance such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea if the above intolerance symptoms appear promptly inform the doctor and consider the use of gastrointestinal motility drugs or the postpyloric feeding route such as nasointestinal tube 3 the patients head should be raised 3045 during feeding to reduce the risk of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia
10
 4 the type speed and quantity of en nutrient solution should be recorded and nutritional indicators such as albumin prealbumin and ferritin should be monitoredsupplemental parenteral nutrition pn is recommended as early as possible if en fails to meet the 60 target energy and protein requirements within 4872 hours
12
 the pn of critically ill patients with covid19 is usually infused by central venous catheterization or central venous catheterization through peripheral venipuncture the speed should not exceed 200 mlh and intravenous infusion pump is recommended
10

critically ill elderly patients with covid19 are more likely to have psychological panic and anxiety due to insufficient knowledge of the disease and lack of access to information the following measures should be considered in these cases
evaluate the patients cognitive changes emotional responses and behavior changes and provide appropriate emotional support for patients with anxious and depressed tendencies selfrating scales such as an anxiety selfrating scale and a depression selfrating scale can be used for assessment and professional psychological personnel can be asked to help patients according to the situationvarious means such as cognitive behavioral therapy positive psychology explaining covid19 in simple and understandable language and providing continuous information support may help elderly patients to a timely transition to the psychological stage of treatment and to build up the confidence to overcome the diseaserelaxation training such as meditation hypnosis music therapy and other ways to relieve patients anxiety and depression should be provided if possible
for discharged patients conditional hospitals should set up special discharge channels with bathrooms inside the first thing for patients after leaving the ward is to enter the bathroom of the discharge channel for personal hygiene disposal nurses should provide assistance for elderly patients with poor selfcare ability in bathing and changing into clean clothes for patients personal belongings discard all that can be discarded for belongings that must be kept 1000 mgl chlorinecontaining disinfectant spray or 75 ethanol wiping disinfection is recommended for clothing that must be kept garments should be irradiated 1 day in advance with ultraviolet light for 1 hour on both sidesdischarge should consist of the following 1 select appropriate breathing rehabilitation exercises and teach them to patients such as airway clearance training breathing exercises pursedlip breathing and abdominal breathing 2 advise patients to strengthen nutritional support eat more highprotein highvitamin highcalorie food and more fresh vegetables fruits milk and so on likewise instruct patients to work and rest regularly and to get adequate sleep 3 it is recommended that patients continue to be monitored for 14 days after discharge and continue to wear masks if possible it is recommended to live in a single room with good ventilation reduce close contact with others eat separately carry out hand hygiene thoroughly and avoid outdoor activities 4 it is recommended that patients return to the hospital for reexamination 2 and 4 weeks after discharge

for practitioners working in a private structure with less space to control and fewer patients the implementation of these recommendations seems easier
for practitioners working in a hospital structure specific protocols may have been put in place by the local operational hygiene teams these will need to be approximated where appropriatefinally the precautionary principles mentioned above will remain valid for future microbial agents to which practitioners specialized in oral health will probably more than others always be exposed 44this article did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interestduring the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic elective surgical cases have been canceled in many institutions to conserve personal protective equipment ppe and prevent spread of the virus it is essential for the medical community to have a full understanding and deep appreciation for the distinctive role of electroconvulsive therapy ect and its colossal value of restoring function and maintaining quality of life electroconvulsive therapy is life-saving for many patients with psychosis andor major depression12 during this pandemic it will be necessary for the ect practitioner with guidance from professional associations and in collaboration with their available healthcare resources to develop guidelines focusing on determining the necessity to perform ect in the safest manner2 early guidance from the anesthesia patient safety foundation and other sources regarding airway management in covid-19positive patients has recommended rapid sequence intubation and avoidance of mask ventilation to reduce the risk of droplet spread and aerosolization of virus3 given the penetrance of covid-19 in the new york metropolitan area the weill cornell medicine newyork-presbyterian hospital anesthesiology and psychiatry departments collaborated to develop guidelines to ensure that the patients who were in urgent need of ect were provided that care while minimizing exposure to the staff and potential spread of disease to other ect patientsthe psychiatry department established a review process to confirm that each patient had an urgent need for ect the department of anesthesiology decided against repeated intubation and extubation or insertion and removal of supraglottic devices for ect treatment because these procedures could potentially result in a greater risk of aerosolization than low tidal volume mask ventilation the dental and oral surgery infection control literature recommends reducing nasopharyngeal viral burden with povidone-iodine nasal swabs and either 10 to 15 peroxide or 02 povidone mouth rinse because of the susceptibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov-2 to oxidizing agents45 chlorhexidine is not as effective6 based on this literature a multifaceted program was developed the highlights of which are illustrated in figure 1before ect treatment each patient is screened for symptoms of covid-19 povidone-iodine nasal swabs and hydrogen peroxide oral rinsing are performed and have been added to the preprocedure orders on the inpatient unit a surgical mask is placed on each patient and the patient performs hand hygiene before leaving the inpatient unit in the preprocedural area a maximum of 2 patients are allowed each separated by 6 ft and each accompanied by a mental health worker the preprocedure checklist fig 2 is reconfirmed before each treatment in the procedure room all personnel are required to wear ppe including an n-95 respirator mask surgical mask with face shield welders-type face shield isolation gown and double gloves personal protective equipment has been donned under observation by another provider and an n-95 self-fit test is confirmed each patient is asked to insert the bite block into their mouth and an anesthesia mask with a high-efficiency particulate air hepa filter at the immediate mask outlet is applied and held in place with a head strap the patient is then preoxygenated while an anesthesia provider inserts a peripheral intravenous iv jackson-rees circuit is used for oxygen delivery because of the ease of spontaneous ventilation compared with an ambu bag the lowest possible inflow of oxygen is selected typically 2 to 4 lmin after induction of anesthesia and application of electrical stimulus positive pressure ventilation is administered at the anesthesiologists discretion with one practitioner ensuring good seal of the facemask and the other provider delivering low tidal volume ventilation as needed to maintain adequate saturation upon return of spontaneous ventilation the circuit anesthesia mask and bite block are removed and placed in a biohazard bag to be discarded a surgical mask is then placed back on the patient doffing of protective gown and gloves and hand hygiene is performed with direct observation the providers n-95 mask and surgical mask with face shield remain in place for the day whereas the welder type face shield is cleaned with sanitizing wipe after each patient as the patient is transported to the post-anesthesia care unit pacu by the anesthesiologist and the psychiatrist the procedure room is decontaminated by a dedicated team all staff wear full ppe supplemental oxygen is administered via nasal cannula under the surgical facemask only if necessary to maintain o2 saturation above 90 upon patient discharge to the floor the room is decontaminatedseveral challenges have been encountered in implementing this ect process these challenges include the availability of ppe and the need to wear an n95 mask covered by a surgical mask for the duration of the treatment day in addition because securing hepa filters for mask ventilation has been problematic high-quality heat and moisture exchanger hmes have been used in place of hepa filters when necessary facility changes necessary to adapt existing practice have included creating appropriate donning and doffing areas and visual educational guides have been placed throughout the ect suite for health care providers to reference whereas anesthesia for ect had been performed by a single anesthesiologist in the past the donning and doffing of ppe in addition to the necessity of ensuring complete mask fit if positive pressure ventilation is used require 2 anesthesia providers to be available at all times to maximize adherence to our practice changes and establish familiarity with the unique aspects of each patient the decision was to use same team of anesthesia providers for ect during the pandemic this practice while ensuring continuity has been stressful for the clinical team which provides anesthetic care multiple times a week to a population of patients with a very high potential penetrance of covid-19 in fact a few of our patients have developed covid-19 symptoms and tested positive during their treatment to this date our treatment team remains asymptomatic although all psychiatric inpatients are required to wear masks at all times and practice social distancing the structure of communal living on the inpatient unit remains a concern for spread the current policy now provides for all patients to be tested on admission and all ect patients are tested weekly for surveillancethese recommendations can easily be applied to the outpatient community setting for ect with the increasing availability of rapid covid-19 testing patients can be screened within 24 to 48 hours before their procedures this extra layer of safety can help prevent the spread of virus within a facility in addition n-95 masks can be covered with a surgical mask enabling the use of the n-95 mask for an entire day or even up to a week if it is also protected with the welder type face shield developing a team-oriented approach for practicing and observing donning and doffing ppe maintaining social distance as much as possible between both staff and patients and being deliberate about decontaminating areas with appropriate quaternary ammoniumisopropyl alcoholhydrogen peroxide wipes are feasible in the outpatient setting and incorporate low-cost steps to ensure the safe performance of ect during the covid-19 pandemic with respect to airway management of the patient during general anesthesia for ect we prefer the jackson-rees circuit over the bag-mask ventilation the jackson-rees circuit in general is less expensive than the bag-mask ventilation and in addition it allows better control of the pressure that is transmitted to the patients respiratory tract the most challenging aspect of the airway management in the outpatient setting with respect to our recommendations is the provision of a second anesthesia clinician to ensure a tight mask fit to minimize and avoid droplet or aerosol transmission of the virus to this end it would be reasonable and acceptable for the anesthesiologist to train a second clinical provider in the ect suite such as an registered nurse rn physician assistant pa nurse practitioner np and the psychiatrist to assist with securing a tight mask fitfuture decisions regarding the need for and frequency of surveillance testing of inpatients as well as determining at what time covid-19positive patients may return to the ect suite to continue their treatment will be reached via collaboration among the departments of anesthesiology psychiatry and infection prevention and controlthe global impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 has had severe implications for frontline health care providers hcps the safety of hcps requires consistent and adequate use of personal protective equipment ppe in particular the use of facial protective equipment against aerosolized transfer of covid-19 droplets is a key recommendation worldwide1 it requires the use of a protective filtering respirator such as a n95 mask eye protection such as glasses fitted facial shields andor specially designed protective suits facilities have noted an attendant increase in medical device-related pressure injuries mdrpi among frontline hcp wearing facial ppe protection that requires risk mitigation guidelines are being rapidly developed all over the world to ensure that the best solution for each setting can be implementedthe staff of the king hamad university hospital khuh includes many ethnicities and various skin types as in many other facilities these hcps have been wearing ppe with n95 masks in high risk areas since february 2020 as protection against covid-19 first confirmed case february 21 20202 early on the pressure injury prevention and nursing quality committees of the khuh agreed that ppe-related pressure and skin injury protection of all staff fell under their purview bundled pressure injury prevention interventions3 such as the intact skin bundle are supported by the best evidence for patient pressure injury prevention the use of these bundles is well documented in high-risk settings accordingly the nursing quality committee advised the pressure injury prevention committee to follow this approach in developing and testing a skin care bundle specifically applicable to the work environment of khuh for those hcps providing acute covid-19 carea mnemonic-based approach4 was used to enhance knowledge retention with a one-word reminder of the importance of self-care help this mnemonic was designed to help hcps remember the new rules and procedures that had been implemented in a very short time this led to the creation of the help enabler which emphasizes 10 evidence-based points to improve hcp prevention of facial mask injuries figure 1 the key message is to help yourself first before helping others elements such as sufficient hydration5 and nutrition6 to support a 4-hour shift emptying bladders before donning ppe7 keeping an eye on the amount of time spent in ppe138 good skin hygiene9 and the importance of mask leak tests1 form the basis of this care bundle additional recommendations include using an acrylate lotion10 or a protective dressing11 for facial protection under ppebecause adhesives increase the risk of skin stripping and subsequent skin tear injuries12 the use of an atraumatic silicone dressing on the face also was proposed the pressure injury prevention committee repurposed a readily available dressing for facial pressure injury prevention in the absence of existing evidence however the team had to establish that this use would not compromise the n95 seal efficacy and facial skin would remain intact under the dressing further because this study had to address skin safety for all staff skin type variation had to be taken into account for this researchers used the fitzpatrick skin type classificationthe fitzpatrick skin type classification13 was developed in the 1980s to measure the impact of sunburn injury on different skin types and is deemed the criterion standard for skin type classification the classification comprises six skin types ranging from light skin type 1 which burns easily and never tans and type 2 that usually burns and tans slightly to olivemedium brown skin type 3 that initially burns and tans well and type 4 that usually tans and finally to dark brown and black skin types 5 and 613 in this study no hcp with type 1 extremely light caucasian skin could be included because there are no nursing staff with that skin type at khuhthis prospective observational cohort study was divided into five steps to establish the appropriateness efficacy and safety of each phase it involved wear-time tests culminating in a final 4-hour crossover experiment developing the protocol and assembling key departments nursing infection control quality assurance representatives covid-19 hospital committee to discuss and approve the proposed skin protection protocol took time this practice innovation began in march 2020 and was tested in the first 2 weeks of april 2020institutional review board approval was received because the study involved human participants reference 20-334 because n95 mask wear is mandatory for covid-19 frontline care provider safety any facial injuries sustained as a result were not deemed an ethical objection for this

included in this phasephase 5 compare the difference in facial skin quality and metabolic oxygen saturation values spo2 as determined by a fingertip applied pulse oximeter with and without facial protection applied in a 4-hour shift period on a normal working day among five participants this test took place over 2 days in a work environment not actively caring for patients who were covid-19 positive facial skin evaluation and spo2 values before and after removal of the mask were repeatedduring the study development period march 2020 relevant guidelines on this topic were scarce a process of creative problem solving was therefore followed to determine how facial skin injuries in health care providers in the authors setting could be addressed in the most efficient and cost-effective manner because staff would have to remove the protective dressing at the end of each shift it was clear that any product with aggressive adhesion would soon strip the outer layer of the skin12 and that the additional pressure exerted by the n95 mask on the barrier would enhance adhesion pain on removal and skin injury over time would be likely12 therefore an atraumatic dressing was requiredat the khuh an atraumatic silicone sacrum dressing is routinely used for pressure injury prevention of high-risk hospitalized patients11 as part of the standard pressure injury prevention skin care bundle3 it is the only type of atraumatic silicone dressing available in the authors setting each dressing is similar in cost to a take-away coffee the aim was to repurpose a single 10 x 10 dressing for frontline hcps during each shift to provide facial protection and limit cost for the institutionfigure 2 illustrates how the dressing was repurposed the application technique includes the bridge of the nose with the open edge of the dressing facing the nose tip and sides of the nose another piece is placed underneath the jaw with the open end facing forward on the chin edge and other pieces are placed over the cheek bones the supplemental table provides a step-by-step overview of dressing applicationearlier testing revealed that the dressing edge could catch on to the n95 mask sponge and create an interlocking mechanism to position two offloading areas next to each other rather than on top of each other this enhances the distribution of pressure over a larger area and prevents additional pressure on any given area by stacking multiple layers the rationale was that if pressure was equally distributed over the nose with the interlocking fit of the n95 mask sponge on the dressing edge the cheekbones were only in need of friction control maintaining mask integrity without adding bulk further this placement was successful even with some small facial hair stubble present on the cheeks and chins of male staff members the dressing sat snugly despite being applied over chin hair and removal was painlessthere was a square piece left for the forehead that could be used as pressure relief underneath protective eye shields or goggles resting on the forehead two additional small pieces remained to offset the pressure from the elastic band of the n95 mask touching the sides of the face close to the ears figure 3to ensure each person uses the correct n95 mask size a standardized initial fit test in accordance with international guidelines is required the khuh infection control team conducted the leak tests in late january and early february using the hood method1415 the method involves placing a see-through polymer hood with an applicator window in front of the face and a tight-fitting seal around the hcps neck to determine a participants individual sensitivity a distinct smell denatonium benzoate is serially sprayed into the hood to determine at what point after how many sprays a smell is observed next the hood is removed and the participant is instructed to rinse hisher mouth and wait 15 minutes then a n95 mask is donned and the procedure repeated the mask fit is deemed effective when no smell is observed if half of the sprays required during the sensitivity test are applied the infection control team documents each time a person passes the fit test smell only observed after more than the threshold number of sprays a person who fails the fit test is fitted with a different sized mask and the spray test is repeated until passing however it only needs to be completed once per person14leak testing is the responsibility of each staff member and involves positioning the n95 mask on the head and fitting it around the nose by applying two fingers on either side of the nose and pressing the mask tight while breathing in next hands are placed over the middle of the mask without adjusting its position and the staff member exhales sharply if air escapes from the sides of the mask the mask should be adjusted and all of the steps repeated until exhaled air exits only through the middle of the mask and no leaks occur on inhalation or exhalation this process is repeated twice every single time an n95 mask is applied16 where limited reuse of n95 masks is practiced it is done in accordance with the khuh infection control protocols governing mask functionalitycross-contamination prevention and not to exceed five uses per person17eight volunteer staff members four males and four females with various fitzpatrick skin types were included in this phase two work in the ed two in icu one in a male surgical ward and three in the wound care unit all participants had previously passed the official n95 fit test all staff previously wore n95 masks without skin protection participants applied the repurposed separated atraumatic dressing segments on their own faces after an initial demonstration the application took less than 5 minutes inclusive of the time required to cut up the dressing they then donned n95 masks and conducted manual leak tests16 all eight participants achieved the same mask positioning with the applied dressing beneath their mask as withoutinfection control then conducted another fit test staff all reported only a slight smell after 4 sprays and this was consistent up to 6 sprays therefore 95 blockage was achieved with this mask configuration this outcome was certified by infection control as conforming to international standardsthat is all eight participants passed the fit test while using the atraumatic dressingstaff were instructed to maintain that exact ppe configuration for the next hour without repositioning or removal once the hour was over they had to remove the mask and the facial dressing themselves take a photograph of their face and present it to the research team all photos were time stamped to ensure masks were not removed before the period was completedstaff also had to report on this experience compared with their previous experienceoriginal fit tests there were no negative comments from the staff despite application over hair in some men in fact some staff noticed that the nose dressing prevented mask movement they had previously experienced when looking up or down this interlock also helped to minimize the perpendicular pressure of the n95 mask exerted on the nasal crest all participants commented on improved nose comfort as well as the absence of facial irritation caused by the direct contact of mask fibers to the cheeks comfort underneath the chin was also noted itching and moisture vapor build-up appeared to be absent in this configuration when asked if the dressing was worth the application time the answer was a unanimous yesthe immediate facial condition of all staff with protective dressings can be seen in figure 4 those with fitzpatrick skin types 2 and 3 lighter skin tone n  2 showed a bit of visible erythema over the bony cheek area no marked erythema or pressure was visible on any of the other participants n  6 no erythema or pressure marks were visible on any staff member on the sides of their faces where the top applied elastic band of the n95 mask is placedone staff member with fitzpatrick type 2 skin was willing to test the mask without facial protection for 2 hours on a different day before the leak tests were conducted researchers believed that this skin type would show visible injury most quickly the next day this participant wore the mask for 3 hours with facial protection applied the results of this trial are depicted in figure 5mask wear without skin protection resulted in friction and chafing with erythema visible over and along the bony prominences of the cheekbones a blanchable area was visible on the bridge of the nose after the 2-hour test this finding is consistent with extant literature reporting that pressure injury can occur in as little as 2 hours811after testing with facial protection slight erythema was again present over the bony prominences of the check bones with only a little redness on the left lateral side of the nose however these changes were much less noticeable than before without additional friction or chafing areas present signifying good mask fit with minimal movement during the 3-hour period all erythema visibly diminished after 1 hourthis experimental test took place over 2 consecutive days with five volunteer staff members one male four female with skin types from fair to dark brown on the fitzpatrick scale researchers theorized that skin damage or injury would be easier to observe in females who have thinner skin than males18 if female skin was protected by the selected method it could reasonably be assumed that males would be protected as well female nurses also outnumber male nurses in this setting and are therefore more likely to participate in direct care and require protectionon the first day of this phase the n95 mask was worn for 4 hours no eating drinking or bathroom breaks allowed with protection prepared and applied by each participant comfort was self-assessed by participants at the end of the 4 hours three participants felt that they could have continued for an hour or two more slight sweating was present with indentations visible on all of the participants faces only one fitzpatrick type 2 presented with slight erythema the least damage was visible on the darkest skinpulse oximetry saturation levels of each participant were also taken before and after the test all participants lost between 1 and 3 spo2 in this test with a mean loss of 2 metabolic spo2 table 1 this is in line with extant studies on n95 mask use that confirms overall oxygen intake is diminished during wear even with a perfectly fitting mask1920on the next day the n95 mask was worn without any protection table 2 each participant positioned their own mask and it was again worn for 4 hours without any eating drinking or bathroom breaks all four female participants battled with discomfort pruritus on the mask edges was noted after the first hour all participants reported that they were relieved when the mask could be removed none wished to continue wearing the mask for a longer timeless moisture build-up was visible compared with the day before but skin indentations were present on all five faces the lighter skin tones appeared to have more pressure-related impact than those with darker skin tones all four females had various levels of skin erythema with the fair skin most damaged of all the participant with the darkest skin had the least visible damage one small darkened area was visible that fully recovered in 1 hour of the female participants three continued to have signs of indentation and erythema an hour after the test with the fair-skinned participant least recovered compared with results from the day beforewith regards to metabolic spo2 on the second day three participants retained the exact same starting value and one gained 1 the remaining participant had a 2 spo2 loss the mean loss was 02 metabolic spo2 figure 6 depicts spo2 readings taken from the same participant before and after both 4-hour teststhis small sample was recruited to serve in a pilot project to determine if the application of a facial protective layer could mitigate facial injury risk among n95 mask wearers more research using different border dressings would be beneficial to expand the evidence base on this topic and give providers more optionsthe staff at khuh is also mainly of west and east asian descent hence the lack of a nurse with a fitzpatrick skin type 1 this is a major limitation because this skin type is usually the most sensitive to injury and skin insults further although the fitzpatrick scale is the criterion standard for sun-related skin damage it may not fully predict pressure and shear damage on skin because deeper injuries may not be immediately visible further testing in institutions that have hcps with fitzpatrick type 1 skin is warrantedfurther work is also needed on n95 mask wear and the impact of reduced spo2 on fatigue headache and concentration to determine the optimal safety balance between skin risk metabolic stress and personal protectionearly on in the covid-19 health crisis the need to protect the skin of hcps was prioritized at the khuh at that time there were no educational resources available to guide practice some enablers have since been released beginning in april 20202425 the creative stepwise process of skin protection described in this article was developed with readily available products and participants who volunteered to help develop a safe solution for skin injury preventionat roughly the same cost as a daily take-away coffee a repurposed atraumatic silicone border dressing can support skin health underneath a tight-fitting mask by cutting it into segments and carefully applying it without creases over the nose cheekbones and sides of the face hcps can achieve pressure redistribution and facial skin protection this method does not appear to interfere with n95 mask integrity and in fact may provide additional leak protection by securing the mask more firmly in position ultimately protecting against accidental viral transfer to the face1 accordingly these authors recommend that hcps add an atraumatic silicone border dressing as a safe and beneficial option to protect facial skin under ppehowever no dressing by itself regardless of testing can provide complete care of facial skin underneath n95 masks it is critical that hcps implement a comprehensive skin care approach frontline staff who help themselves by taking responsibility for their own skin care who are well prepared well rested fed and hydrated can more safely take care of othersit is the authors hope that this creative evidence-based clinical facial protection solution and help enabler will be of assistance to their global colleagues in the fight against covid-19during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic in 2020 masks have become one of the most indispensable pieces of personal protective equipment on 20 january 2020 prof nanshan zhong the head of the high-level expert group appointed by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china to fight the novel coronavirus emphasized the importance of wearing masks in an interview with china central television 1 on 22 january 2020 the spokesperson of the national health commission in the state council information office of the peoples republic of china advocated the mask civilization and pointed out that wearing masks is not only for the protection of ourselves but also for the protection of others 2 however according to the data publicly reported by the ministry of industry and information technology of the peoples republic of china the production of masks in china was only 8 million per day on 23 january 2020 and reached 10 million per day by 2 february 2020 given chinas population of over 14 billion people the huge mask demandsupply gap is obvious according to technical guidance on the selection and use of masks for different population to prevent novel coronavirus which was released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china on 4 february 2020 people in supermarkets shopping malls airports subways indoor offices and other low-risk places are recommended to wear disposable medical masks or surgical masks to prevent the spread of the covid-19 virus 3 as a result medical masks which were originally designed for use in clinics and hospitals are now widely used and appear in stations airports markets parks and other public places the technical guideline also indicated that during the covid-19 pandemic the use of masks may be appropriately extended including the duration of single use and times of repeated use if it is safe to do so in particular people in low-risk places are recommended to reuse masks however the existing national standards and local standards for masks mainly focus on the performance of disposable masks and there are no specific requirements or instructions on mask performance for multiple uses including the duration of a single use disinfection methods and the number of times a mask can safely be reused how can masks be efficiently sanitized for multiple uses during the covid-19 pandemic are masks damaged during decontamination treatment how many times can masks be decontaminated by appropriate methods in fact there is no scientific theory or experimental data support to answer these questions during the mask shortage most peopleincluding front-line medical staffhave been spontaneously reusing masks several times which eases the tension between supply and demand to a certain extent however this practice might also increase these peoples risk of exposure therefore user-friendly technologies and methods are urgently needed to effectively extend the service time of masksmasks including disposable medical masks surgical masks medical protective masks and dust masks are usually made of non-woven polypropylene fabric with electrostatic properties that enhance particle capture the electrostatic charge keeps airborne particles out by drawing them onto the fiber surfaces much like iron filings are drawn onto a magnet the spaces between the fibers of the mask at the microscale are much larger than the sizes of bacterial viruses and respiratory aerosolsdroplets so masks are not able to block particles at the nanoscale by means of mechanical filtration therefore the electrostatic charge on the fibers plays an important role in intercepting virus particles with diameters of 100 nm and aerosolsdroplets containing bacterial viruses in the process of using the mask elimination of the electrostatic charge layer occurs along with the deposition of bacteria viruses and haze water vapor onto the electrostatic layers which causes a decline in filtration efficiency and even invalidation of the protective performance of the mask therefore during the covid-19 pandemic if people are driven by necessity to extend the use of masks that were originally designed and marketed as disposable masks there are two points to consider first user-friendly decontamination to kill possible covid-19 viruses on the used masks and second efficiently controlled charge regeneration of masks to maintain mask performance for reuse on 14 february 2020 the sciencenet website reported a preliminary regeneration treatment approach toward the reuse of disposable masks developed by our group at beijing university of chemical technology 4 advice was given to soak used medical masks in hot water at a temperature greater than 56 c typically 6080 c for 30 min for decontamination ordinary household appliances such as a hair dryer electric fan or electronic igniter would then be used to dry the masks and recharge them with electrostatic charge successful regeneration of a mask could be confirmed by sprinkling the mask with small scraps of paper at home without the need for special professional instruments 4 according to official guidance from prevention and control program of covid-19 4th edition released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china on 6 february 2020 this temperature  56 c and time 30 min are efficient for killing the covid-19 virus the charge-regeneration procedure aims to infuse the filter with electrostatic charge which is the key contributor to a masks high level of filtrationin this article we summarize our experimental results and evaluations on three kinds of typical masks disposable medical masks surgical masks kn95-grade masks treated by the so-called hot water decontamination  charge regeneration approach the evolution of static electricity on the masks is revealed the microstructures of the masks were studied by scanning electron microscope sem and the waterproof properties were assessed by the hydrostatic pressure method the filterability of the masks was tested according to respective national standards and local standards the performance of the kn95-grade masks in 121 c steam for 30 min which is a well-accepted approach for killing almost all pathogens was also investigated furthermore a method based on fluorescent nanoparticle penetrant inspection was proposed for the detection of inner defects in used masks in order to provide necessary data for the development of reusable masks structural optimization and evaluation standardsthree types of disposable masks were tested disposable medical masks chtc jiahua non-woven co ltd china disposable surgical masks from three locations esound medical device co ltd anbang medical supplies co ltd and yubei medical supplies co ltd china and kn95-grade masks the 3m 9502 and kf94 masks from republic of korea these masks are referred to herein as jh yx ab yb 3m and kf respectivelythree kinds of containers including a household aluminum basin a polypropylene plastic lunch box and a stainless steel thermos cup were used in the experiments in a typical procedure boiling water was directly poured into the container at room temperature the volume of water exceeded 80 of the total capacity of the container and the temperature was measured by a thermometer the mask was immersed in the water by placing a heavier object on top of it such as a spoon the container was then closed and the mask was left to soak in the hot water for 30 min after that the container was opened and the mask was removed from the hot water the liquid on the mask was slightly shaken off and the mask was placed on the surface of dry insulating material such as wooden plastic tables and bed sheets the mask was then dried with a standard hair dryer for 10 mina hand-held electrostatic field meter fmx-004 simco-ion usa was used to test the electrostatic charge of mask the mask to be tested was hung on an insulation component at least 5 m away from other instruments with static electricity in order to avoid interference from other static electricity fields before measurement the researcher washed his or her hands with water to remove static electricity from the hands the probe was gradually moved closer to the measurement position on the mask until the two laser dots from the electrostatic field meter coincided the value of the instrument readings was recordedwaterproof testing of the masks was performed by a buchner funnel procedure to summarize the mask was placed at the bottom of the bowl with the outer surface of the mask facing upward a hose pipe was used to attach the filter flask sidearm onto the vacuum aspirator a vacuum aspirator operating at 30 lmin1 was used for the suction of liquids through the filter paper a total of 100 ml water was then poured onto the surface of mask within 20 s from a height of 20 cm the pumping filtration was maintained for 3 min and the flask was watched to see if water dropped down then the water was removed from the buchner funnel and the vacuum suction system was turned off the inner surface of the mask was then observed to determine the wettabilitywaterproofness of the maskthe filtration efficiency of the samples for sodium chloride nacl particles was measured by using tsi 8130 equipment tsi incorporated usa the particle size distribution of the nacl aerosol for the specified test conditions was the median diameter of the number of particles at 0075  0020 m the geometric standard deviation did not exceed 186 and the concentration did not exceed 200 mgm3 the detection system had a device to neutralize the charged particles to test the kn95-grade masks the gas flow rate was stabilized to 85  4 lmin1 while to test the disposable medical masks and surgical masks the gas flow rate was stabilized to 30  2 lmin1 and the cross-sectional area of the air flow was 100 cm2it has been well accepted that the covid-19 virus can be killed after being maintained at over 56 c for 30 min 5 due to thermal activation the envelope protein of the virus will denature and the virus will lose its infectious ability therefore high-temperature treatment is an effective way to kill the virus in our work we proposed the hot water method for mask decontamination that is killing the potential covid-19 virus on a used mask by keeping the mask in hot water at greater than 56 c for 30 min 5 fig 1
a shows the three types of containers used in our experiments a household aluminum basin a polypropylene plastic lunch box and a stainless steel thermos cup when boiling water was first poured into the container at a room temperature of 20 c the temperature of the water was measured at around 90 c and decreased as time passed after 30 min the temperatures of the water in the covered aluminum basin and in the polypropylene plastic lunch box were both around 60 c and the temperature of the water in the stainless steel thermos cup was 85 c fig 1b thus the hot water approach for mask decontamination is easy to achieve at home compared with other proposed decontamination methods for masks such as organic solvent ultraviolet uv radiation and hydrogen peroxide steam hot water decontamination is more suitable for people to perform at home without the use of additional solvents or high-tech equipment in addition this approach has the advantage of cleaning the mask to some degree fig 1c shows a typical used mask that has been worn for 4 h although the used mask looks as good as new some fluorescent spots were clearly observed under a 365 nm uv lamp the fluorescence signal was generated by wastes from the oral cavity and respiratory tract of the user these wastes were adsorbed on the masks making the masks smell bad after decontamination of the used mask in hot water followed by drying treatment no fluorescent spots were observed on the masks under the uv lamp fig 1d and there was no bad smell from the maskstypical masks are composed of three layers of non-woven fabric fig 2
a the outer layer is a waterproof non-woven fabric that is used to isolate the liquid sprayed by others and the inner layer is a common non-woven fabric that absorbs the moisture released by the wearer the filter layer in the middle which is composed of a polypropylene melt-blown non-woven fabric treated with electret serves as a barrier against germs in typical masks the melt-blown filter layer is 100-1000 m thick and is composed of polypropylene microfibers with diameters in the range of 1-10 m figs 2b and c the filtering mechanism of a typical mask involves brownian diffusion entrapment inertial collision gravity sedimentation and electrostatic adsorption among these factors electrostatic adsorption is critical for masks to capture nano-sized particles in order to achieve high filterability while maintaining low gas resistance during mask decontamination in hot water the static electricity disappears to reuse a mask the microfibers of the melt-blown filter layers must be recharged with static electricity to capture nanoparticles after naturally air-drying masks for 10 h in our experiment the static electricity of the surgical masks was recovered to 60 of the level of new masks fig 2d due to micro-friction of the microfibers caused by the air flow of the drying process however when a more effective method was usedthat is drying the mask with a standard hair dryer for 10 minthe static electricity of the surgical mask was recovered to 90 of the level of a new mask fig 2e these results indicate that the electrostatic charge attenuation velocity of a regenerated mask is similar as that of a new mask therefore it is feasible and effective to recharge a mask with static electricity compared with natural air-dry processing the use of a standard hair dryer removes the moisture from a wet mask more quickly and recharges the mask with static electricity more efficiently this method is particularly suitable for rapid charge regeneration of masks in humid regions or during humid weather in addition allowing a mask to air-dry naturally over a long period of time allows the potential growth of a large amount of bacteria and microorganisms in contrast rapidly regenerating the charge after a mask has been decontaminated in hot water prevents the growth of bacteria inside the maskas mentioned above the outer layer of a mask is usually made of a waterproof non-woven fabric to isolate the liquid sprayed by others therefore a masks waterproof property is a key factor for ensuring the masks performance in blocking the microorganisms in liquid droplets using a hydrostatic testing method fig 3
a we demonstrated that the regenerated masks presented good water resistance even after masks had been repeatedly treated for 10 cycles of decontamination soaking in hot water for 30 min and charge regeneration drying with a hair dryer for 10 min they still maintained a good waterproof property that is no water seepage was observed in the inner layers of the masks fig 3b these results indicate that decontamination and regeneration processing over 10 cycles did not damage the structure of the polypropylene fibers as seen in the sem images the microstructures of the regenerated masks were similar to those of new masks and no significant fiber breakage or fracturing was observed in either the outer layers fig 3c or the filter layers fig 3das typical personal protective equipment masks are used to block microorganisms droplets pollen and other particles thus filterability is one of the most important indexes of a mask in our experiments the filterability of three typical mask types disposable medical masks surgical masks kn95-grade masks was tested after hot water decontamination and charge-regeneration treatments following the rules of the respective national standards or industrial standards in china to summarize the regenerated masks were treated by soaking in hot water at 65 c for 30 min and were then dried using a standard hair dryer for 10 min a bacterial filtration efficiency bfe test determines the filtration efficiency by comparing the bacterial control counts with the test article effluent counts and is a key performance indicator for both disposable medical masks and surgical masks according to the standards for a single-use medical face mask yyt 09692013 and a surgical mask yy 04692011 the bfe of these masks should be no less than 95 fig 4
shows the bfe values of a regenerated disposable medical mask jh and a regenerated surgical mask yb in our experiments which are higher than 95 fig 4a a particle filtration efficiency pfe test evaluates the nonviable particle retention or filtration efficiency of filter media and other filtration devices at sub-micron levels the standards for single-use medical face masks yyt 09692013 have no requirement for pfe whereas the standards for surgical masks yy 04692011 state that the pfe should be no less than 30 under specific conditions in our experiments we found that most of the regenerated surgical masks had a pfe much higher than 30 with an average value of 923 for kn95-grade masks the pfe should be no less than 95 under specific conditions according to the chinese national standard gb 26262019 in our experiment the kn95-grade masks 3m and kf retained a pfe greater than 95 fig 4b in order to investigate the effects of the regeneration treatment on the properties of the masks we prepared samples of five different brands of masks jh ab yx 3m and kf that were treated by hot water decontamination and charge-regeneration processing for 10 cycles as shown in fig 4c regeneration processing over 10 cycles had little effect on the filtration properties furthermore we extended our investigations to decontamination treatment at a higher temperature the kn95-grade masks 3m and kf were placed in an autoclave covered with a clean piece of cloth to avoid damage from heavy turbulence steam sterilization is the most widely available and dependable method for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities and most hospitals and many clinics already have the necessary materials on hand to sterilize surgical equipment in our experiments the masks were treated by pressurized steam at 121 c for 30 min the average pfe of the 3m 1860 masks after steam sterilization was measured to be 992 and that of the kf94 masks was 966 fig 4d according to the experimental results the regenerated masks was still at a relatively high level therefore the regenerated masks should have a significant effect on blocking microorganisms droplets pollen and other particlesin order to study the influence of actual service processing on masks we examined mask samples that had been worn for 8 h by participants for surgical masks the effects of wearing varied among individuals and for the same individuals at different times after being worn for 8 h followed by hot water decontamination and charge regeneration the pfe values of the surgical masks decreased by 0512 in our experiments based on the testing of 15 samples however all of the tested kn95-grade masks 10 samples that had been worn for 8 h followed by hot water decontamination and charge regeneration were able to retain filtration efficiencies greater than 95 it was observed that the waterproof property of masks that were worn might change as a result of the adsorption of dirt and oil from the participants skin fig 5
a shows droplets on the surface of the outer layer of a typical disposable medical mask under daylight and under a 365 nm uv lamp respectively under uv excitation the droplets of water lacked brightness but the fluorescent nanodispersion droplets exhibited a bright blue emission due to the fluorescence of the carbon nanodots after removing the droplets no significant marks of the fluorescent nanoparticles were observed indicating the excellent resistance to wetting of the outer layer of the mask however if the wettability of the masks was enhanced by potential interfacial reactions between dirtoil and the fibers a spontaneous infiltration process could be promoted in this work we developed a fluorescent liquid penetrant test based on fluorescent nanodispersion for investigating masks to summarize water-dispersible carbon nanodots 6 were sprayed onto the surface of the outer layer of the mask and the liquid drops were then allowed to remain for 30 min while the penetrant was sinking into the mask after that the excess liquid on the surface of the outer layer of the mask was removed and the inner layer of the mask was inspected under the irradiation of a hand-held uv lamp with emission at 365 nm as shown in fig 5c no significant fluorescence signal of the nanodots was observed when testing new masks however the fluorescent nanoparticles penetrated into the surface defects of a mask that was damaged by oil with the fluorescence signal mainly being concentrated in the damaged area where the hydrophobicity of the fibers changed these findings may aid in the development of new materials and design strategies for reusable masksa company named zhejiang runtu co ltd which is a large-scale stock enterprise with over 4000 staff members engaged in producing and selling disperse dyes reactive dyes chemical intermediates and so forth faced a shortage of masks in mid-february 2020 when the workers resumed work to carry out scientific and orderly prevention and control work in accordance with the law the workers needed to wear masks during the covid-19 pandemic however it was difficult to obtain enough mask supplies in china from february to march 2020 scientific and technical engineers at runtu learned about our technology which had been reported by sciencenet 4 and independently verified the engineering feasibility of the hot water decontamination and charge-regeneration method the company then required their workers to apply the hot water decontamination and charge-regeneration method in order to safely and effectively reuse their masks between 20 february and 30 march 2020 mask usage at runtu was reduced from one mask per day per person to one mask every three days per person and 122 500 masks were saved by this company during the covid-19 pandemic in china 7 8masks have been recommended as a powerful tool to tackle the covid-19 pandemic in many countries around the world people are not allowed into public places or on public transportation without wearing masks 9 growing evidence is demonstrating the benefits of wearing masks in preventing the transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals 10 however the limited productivity and scarce resources cannot meet the ever-increasing demand for masks meanwhile pollution caused by waste masks is having an adverse effect on the economic development of society and on the ecological environment therefore the development of user-friendly methods to effectively extend the service time of masks is urgently needed our group proposed a specifically designed method for household use to extend the use of disposable masks in mid-february 2020 in this article we summarize our experimental results and evaluations on three typical kinds of mask disposable medical masks surgical masks and kn95-grade masks treated by the so-called hot water decontamination  charge regeneration approach we provide solid evidence that the essential performance of the masks was maintained after decontamination for up to 10 cycles it should be noted that several other technical solutions for n95 respirators have been reported very recently for example researchers at the university of nebraska medical center built towers of uv bulbs to kill viruses on masks while bioquell inc manufactured hydrogen peroxide vapor generators for the decontamination of n95 masks for multiple use 11 scientists at 4c air inc and at stanford university have reported that heat  85 c under various levels of humidity  100 relative humidity is a promising nondestructive method for the preservation of the filtration properties in n95-grade respirators since they have found that uv light can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of masks 12compared with approaches that use high-tech equipment such as uv radiation towers hydrogen peroxide vapor generators or constant-temperature cabinets our work provides a simpler and more convenient method for the decontamination of masks during the covid-19 pandemic by soaking the masks in hot water at greater than 56 c for 30 min viruses are killed and the dirt on the surface of the masks is removed after the mask is dried with a standard hair dryer for 10 min the static electricity of the surgical mask can be recovered to 90 of the level of a new mask according to tests on three typical kinds of masks disposable medical masks surgical masks and kn95-grade masks all of the regenerated masks retained a similar waterproof property microstructure and filterability in comparison with the respective new masks for the kn95-grade masks with good quality we found that the masks retained a pfe greater than 95 after being treated in pressurized steam at 121 c for 30 min these results demonstrate that the regenerated masks should have a significant effect in blocking microorganisms droplets pollens and other particles we also studied the influence of actual service processing on masks for surgical masks the effects of wearing vary among individuals and for the same individual at different times after being worn for 8 h followed by hot water decontamination and charge regeneration the pfe values of surgical masks decreased by 0512 in our experiments on 15 samples however all tested samples of kn95-grade masks that had been worn for 8 h followed by pressurized steam at 121 c for 30 min and charge regeneration were able to retain filtration efficiencies greater than 95 a fluorescent liquid penetrant test based on fluorescent nanodispersion for investigating masks was carried out and revealed that the adsorption of dirt and oil from participants skin was partly responsible for changes in the wettability and filterability of polypropylene masks many researchers have made great efforts regarding the reuse of masks and have conducted active and beneficial exploration some industry associations have issued related standards to ensure the quality and life of masks for multiple reuses including the standards for reusable civil masks tbjfx 00012020 and for reusable daily protective masks tcstm 003872020 that have been released by industry associations in china many productions of reusable masks are coming onto the market 13 we hope that this short communication article can contribute to alleviating the panic over mask shortage and to promoting new methods for the detection of mask damage zones and the optimal design of reusable masksthe current influenza a h1n1 2009 virus pandemic

interest as described above were analysed by intentiontotreat analysis the two n95 arms were also combined and compared to the medical mask arm given that there was no significant difference between them and rates of fit test failure were extremely low in the fittested arm 5461 fit test failures differences in proportions between the trial arms were tested by calculation of pearsons chisquare using sas 92 software cary nc usa the distribution of key potentially confounding variables between study arms was compared to estimate the odds ratio while adjusting for the clustering effects we used a random effect logistic regression model in the model we added a hospitalspecific random intercept in the linear predictors and maximum likelihood was estimated using adaptive quadrature

we also conducted multivariable analysis to adjust for the potential confounders in the initial model we included all the variables along with the main exposure variable those were significant p  005 in the univariate analysis we then used a backward elimination method to remove the variables that did not have any confounding effect that is could not make meaningful roughly 10 change in the effect measure with the main exposure variable

infections compared to fittested n95s for all n95 versus medical masks the rates were 39 versus 67 for cri 03 versus 06 for ili 14 versus 26 for laboratoryconfirmed virus and 03 versus 1 for influenza but these differences were not significant all infection outcomes were consistently higher approximately double in the medical mask group compared to the n95 group figure 2 there were no cases of influenza in the nonfittested n95 arm three in the fittested n95 arm and five in the medical mask arm after adjustment for clustering nonfittested n95 masks were significantly protective compared to medical masks against cri but other outcomes were not significant between n95 and medical masks table 2 when compared to the convenience nomask group and adjusted for clustering n95 nonfittested was significantly protective against cri and all n95 was protective against laboratoryconfirmed virus and laboratoryconfirmed influenza table 3 in a post hoc analysis carried out to adjust for potential confounders which were unevenly distributed between arms all n95 and hospital level remained significant for cri and laboratoryconfirmed viral infection but handwashing vaccination and highrisk

n95 group in health workers who wore masks throughout their shift however only the n95 nonfittested arm was significantly protective against cri and there were no other significant differences between n95 respirators and medical masks for the four primary outcomes in the adjusted analysis however it should be noted that under the null hypothesis where there is no difference between groups the probability that we wrongly find at least one significant difference given the 12 tests undertaken is 46 the trial may also be underpowered because observed attack rates were lower than expectedthe rates of all outcomes were higher in the convenience nomask group than in the masks groups by adjusted intentiontotreat analysis n95 respirators but not medical masks had significantly lower rates of infection compared to no masks however the convenience nomask group was not a randomized control arm and hospitals in this group were actually selected on the basis that most of their staff did not wear masks which is not the norm in hospitals in beijing suggesting that conditions in those hospitals were different than those in hospitals from the masks groups as a consequence it is not possible to make any definitive judgement on the efficacy of masks on this basis one possible bias would be if those hospitals had differentially higher risk of infection compared to the intervention hospitals for example because of the occurrence of outbreaks however we monitored all hospitals involved in the study for outbreaks which may have increased apparent attack rates and none were documented other than that possible sources of bias that could have plausibly increased the infection rate in the control arm namely vaccination handwashing hospital level and highrisk procedures were measured in a post hoc adjusted analysis only hospital level and the n95 arm were significant against cri and laboratoryconfirmed viral infectionrespiratory protection is a key strategy for pandemic control and key to sustaining the health care workforce the fact that rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the n95 group suggest that n95 respirators might offer better protection for hcws but a larger trial is needed to make a definitive judgment about the relative efficacy of respirators and medical masks a recent smaller trial found no difference between n95 and medical masks but was probably underpowered to detect any differences
11
 further the intervention in that study was use of respiratory protection only during care of identified febrile patients with ili or highrisk procedures this is different from the intervention in our study which comprised wearing the mask for the entire shift in addition that study measured serological evidence of influenza as an outcome which comprised the majority of outcomes but did not exclude influenzavaccinated participants a flaw that would have resulted in falsepositive cases of influenzathe finding that fit testing did not improve the efficacy of n95 respirators is important although it could be explained by a lack of power the value of fit testing varies with the quality of the respirator and our study used a highquality respirator these results would not be generalizable to other respirators where fit testing may be more important as such we still recommend that fit testing be part of the process of using respiratorsthe small number of randomization units along with the small numbers of cases means that estimation of multivariate models would not necessarily converge in the post hoc multivariable analysis we could not adjust for all of the factors because of high correlation among some of themother limitations of the study include the generalizability of our results to other types of respirators and to other hcw populations in other countries scoping work with australian hcws showed compliance of 10 with continual mask wearing during a severe influenza season
24
 beijing was selected to maximize the power of the study because of the strong culture of mask wearing among hcws another limitation of the study is that cluster rcts can be impacted by heterogeneity of behaviours meaning that we cannot exclude such effects caused by behaviours we did not measure the cluster design is also strength as interventions against infectious diseases can have herd effects in infectious diseases which can spread from person to person the herd effect is a real and documented phenomenon where protecting some individuals with an intervention most commonly vaccination but also applicable to other interventions can also protect individuals who were not protected by the intervention therefore if some individuals are randomized to masks on a ward the individuals who do not wear masks may also be protected because of the effect the masks have on interrupting the transmission of disease from person to person this is why it is preferable to use cluster design where everyone in the cluster gets the same interventionin our study masks or respirators were worn during the entire shift some policies recommend maskrespirator use only when hcws are conducting highrisk procedures or entering an isolation room whether masksrespirators will be protective when used only when an identified episode of exposure occurs depends on whether hcws accurately identify all episodes of risk whether most transmission occurs after clearly identified exposures and whether there is transmission from asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections there is currently no evidence on how much of a hcws risk is unidentified or unrecognized in our study hcws who conducted highrisk procedures had higher rates of cri but not of laboratoryconfirmed pathogens or influenza further clinical research is required to determine the efficacy of continuous versus targeted mask useuntil now public health policy for dealing with pandemics has relied heavily on data from a modest number of often old and inadequate studies data from the sars outbreak showed that masks reduced transmission of sars and other viral respiratory infections
25
 
26
 during sars the use of n95 respirators and medical masks was the major protective infection control measure
27
 however the relative contribution of each type or the difference between n95 respirators and medical masks cannot clearly be determined from observational dataproblems with adherence to maskrespirator use are also a potential problem we showed that in australia less than half of parents who were randomized to wear a medical mask or respirator while their child was ill adhered with mask wearing
10
 there may be adverse effects of wearing masks which can reduce adherence
28
 
29
 
30
 our study showed significantly higher reported adverse effects of n95 respirators compared to medical masks consistent with other studies
28
 interestingly this population of chinese hcws reported overall similar rates of discomfort with masks as parents in our household study
10
 with higher rates in the n95 group but it did not affect their adherence with maskrespirator wearing this suggests that discomfort is not the primary driver of adherence and rather cultural acceptability and other behavioural factors may be the main reason for nonadherence the past experience of beijing health workers with sars may also be a factor in the high adherence this level of adherence may not translate to western cultural contexts in a normal winter season especially for n95 respirators however adherence can change with perception of risk during a pandemic we would expect hcws to have higher adherence to infection control measures in summary our study adds evidence on the use of respiratory protection for hcws but highlights the need for larger trials and comparison of

for roche novartis and gsk biologicals ceasing in 2007the new outbreak of covid-19 has recently become a serious threat to the health of people around the world covid-19 is caused by the sars-cov-2 which is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus that causes infection and respiratory failure swerdlow and finelli 2020 wu et al 2020 and has led to the thousands of people deaths thienemann et al 2020 following the who announcement the global emergency committee identified the need for early detection quarantine and prompt treatment as a global concern sohrabi et al 2020 because people with the virus do not have clinical symptoms such as fever cough etc in the early stages for this reason there is not enough information on how to disinfect and disinfect surfaces and hands human-to-human transmission through air food and water and the presence of the virus in human wastewater and waste there are several factors involved in transmitting the virus these conditions can be included in environment and human behavior fig 1 the distribution of human population migration social interactions climate change deforestation habitat invasion agricultural growth and direct contact with domestic and wild animals fall into this category barratt et al 2019 dehghani and kassiri 2020 on the other hand the effect of environmental factors such as ambient temperature humidity etc relating to the covid-19 pandemic fig 1 has not been sufficiently investigated how the virus enters the body eyes ears mouth and nose is not well known by the release of aerosols and droplets containing sars-cov-2 in human societies however previous findings in the epidemic of a virus similar to sars-cov-2 can be used in this regard sun et al 2020 because the methods of transmission are not currently known therefore cdc recommends standard precautions contact and air and eye protection glasses or face shields cdc 2020b e it has been reported that even with personal protective equipment ppe it is still possible to get infected dai 2020 because there is no convincing evidence to support the effect of ppe use in the prevention of infection yang 2020 the significant concern about sars-cov-2 is its transmission dehghani and kassiri 2020 according to the who there is no certainty about the persistence of the sars-cov-2 on surfaces however the virus appears to act like other coronaviruses and can survive on the surface for at least several hours parry 2004 for this reason the following health points in public places hospitals and residential houses has a significant role in controlling the transmission of the disease who 2020a dealing with covid-19 and preventing its rapid and dangerous spread is a global challenge therefore the fight against this disease requires global management however due to the potential variability of this disease according to the type of climate and other environmental factors its prevention and control should be investigated quickly and seriously askari et al 2018 when a new pandemic occurs a lot of health advice is given anyway it should be noted that these methods may not be the most accurate and correct but following them can be effective until sufficient knowledge is obtained nevertheless a hierarchy to deal with sars-cov-2 transmission involves three steps 1 self-care 2 control of environmental factors and 3 the use of ppe lai et al 2020 this study aimed to investigate the effect and role of various factors including environmental factors climate change water transfer air and food disinfection of surfaces and hands in the transmission and prevalence of covid-19 pandemicscurrently due to the prevalence of covid-19 in most parts of the world one of the primary concerns is the relationship between environmental factors such as rising summer temperatures and the rapid prevalence of coronavirus abbasi et al 2020 wang et al 2020b one study observed the relationship between the numbers of positive daily sars-cov-2 cases with three environmental factors maximum relative humidity maximum temperature and maximum wind speed in four cities in china and five cities in italy in this study the relationship between the prevalence of the covid-19 with maximum air humidity and wind speed was negligible and statistically not significant although in most cases with increasing humidity and wind speed the prevalence has decreased the association between covid-19 prevalence and maximum ambient temperature was negligible to moderate also with increasing temperature in most of the studied cities the prevalence of the disease has decreased bhattacharjee 2020 the study by chin et al 2020 reported the resistance of the sars-cov-2 at 4 c for a long time but at 70 c its resistance was 5 min in general heat high or low ph and sunlight make it easier to kill the coronavirus who 2020b however the results of a study also showed that the virus is stable at different phs of 310 at room temperature chin et al 2020 a new study of 24139 positive sars-cov-2 cases was conducted in 26 regions in china its results show that with a 1 c increase of the minimum ambient air temperature the cumulative number of cases decreases by 086 fig 1 wang et al 2020baccording to the cdc sars-cov-2 transmission through food food packages and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease however based on the available evidence and the persistence of the virus on the surfaces between a few hours and a few days cdc suggested washing and then disinfection as the best way to control this virus seymour et al 2020b sanitary recommendations are also recommended when relocation and preparing food such as washing hands regularly separating raw meat from other foods cooking at high temperatures and storing food in the refrigerator eslami et al 2015 seymour et al 2020c the most important health recommendations for staff involved in preparing and distributing food include complete personal hygiene such as covering the nose and mouth by bending the elbow during sneezing or coughing isolating employees with covid-19 symptoms or having contact with these patients and following the minimum distance 6 feet or 18 m between employees also providing multiple points for hand washing and disinfection at work and washing and disinfection of surfaces with high contact by diluted sodium hypochlorite 01 seymour et al 2020cguaranteeing safe water collecting sewage and maintaining effective hygiene during infectious diseases including covid-19 pandemic play a key role in supporting human health eslami et al 2018 who 2020b the risk of covid-19 appears to be low through the stool of an infected person there is evidence that sars-cov-2 may lead to intestinal infection and be present in the stool bhattacharjee 2020 studies show that approximately 2 to 10 percent of confirmed sars-cov-2 cases have been associated with diarrhea chen et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020a two studies have reported the detection of residual sars-cov-2 viral rna in the stool of patients with sars-cov-2 holshue et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 yet only one study has reported the sars-cov-2 from a cultured stool sample who 2020b in the latest study the report of the presence of the sars-cov-2 virus in sewage has been confirmed the presence of the virus in the wastewater even when the prevalence of the virus is low indicates that the sars-cov-2 can survive in the sewage this finding could be a sensitive tool for tracking and monitoring the rate of virus rotation in communities lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 some studies have reported that coronavirus can remain in water or wastewater sources for days or weeks qu et al 2020 due to the evidence of the virus surviving in aquatic and sewage environments its presence in water resources is dependent on essential factors such as temperature sunlight and the presence of organic compounds that the virus can adsorb to and protect themself against sunlight the presence of other antagonistic microorganisms can also affect its survival in water resources according to the latest who report there is no evidence that human-type coronavirus has been transmitted through contaminated drinking water naddeo and liu 2020 in general coated viruses are less environmentally friendly and are more sensitive to oxidants such as chlorine the sars-cov-2 is likely to be significantly inactivated more rapidly than human intestinal viruses without water-borne diseases in contact with oxidants who 2020bresearch has shown that newly infected patients have no clinical symptoms and can easily be the source of the spread and transmission of sars-cov-2 this transmission can be through sneezing coughing talking to other people at close range and through the foul airflow li et al 2020 zhi 2020 based on the available evidence it is not thought that air diffusion is one of the main transmission routes dehghani and kassiri 2020 non-invasive ventilation high flow oxygen therapy intubationextubation nebulization open suctioning of airway secretions bronchoscopy induction of sputum bag and mask ventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation etc are the principal causes of sars-cov-2 aerosol release in airflow cdc 2020d for example the role of environmental pollution in several hospitals has been evaluated following the outbreak of mers-cov in 2015 in korea as well as experimental studies on the survival and stability of mers-cov on surfaces and air bin et al 2016 there is also the possibility of air stability for sars-cov-2 therefore the use of viral filters and closed suctioning airflow changes and negative pressure air pollution in closed environments with the probability of infection is recommended malhotra et al 2020 thus people in contaminated environments should use a mask and if there is no mask should use face masks bowdle and munoz-price 2020 facial hair can provide a way for sars-cov-2 to penetrate malhotra et al 2020 using non-standard masks can also exacerbate the incidence of sars-cov-2 jones and xia 2018 besides wearing a mask in some health workers has shown symptoms of claustrophobia respiratory distress discomfort and skin irritation barratt et al 2019 the most available type is the n95 mask which according to studies can be sterilized and reused by hydrogen peroxide gamma rays from co60 uv rays dry and wet heat and ethylene oxide in the meantime the use of radiation is preferable to other methods card et al 2020 cramer et al 2020 kenney et al 2020 gamma co60 with a dose of 10 kg can sterilize the n95 mask used in sars-cov environments and kill the virus feldmann et al 2019 however high doses of radiation may damage the fibers of the mask and allow air to pass through without purification but it does not have secondary radiation and its side effects harrell et al 2018 hydrogen peroxide is also a useful antiviral and has no adverse effects on the respiratory tract viscusi et al 2009 enhanced traffic control bundling etcb was very effective at the time of the sars-cov outbreak due to the similarity of this disease with covid-19 the application of this strategy can prevent the transmission of the disease through the air yen et al 2020 in this way patients with clinical symptoms quarantined other people use disinfectant and ppe during patients visits to the hospital this process has been approved in the control of other epidemic diseases such as ebola and sars-cov and is currently being implemented in covid-19 pandemics ong et al 2020 schwartz et al 2020b yen et al 2015 the possibility of transmitting bioaerosols with the ability to move up to 6 feet through the air has also been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmologists cdc 2020c as a result hepa filters have been used for ventilation still air-born emissions for sars-cov-2 have not yet been reported according to available evidence it is not confirmed that air can be one of the principal causes of transmission therefore it can be predicted that if any suspended matter is created in the air of medical centers the transfer will be easy who 2020anumerous factors are contributing to the spread of global diseases such as covid-19 which is spreading worldwide these conditions include ecology and human behavior these cases have been directly and indirectly involved in the occurrence of some problems and diseases barratt et al 2019 dehghani and kassiri 2020 most coronaviruses are pathogenic and can cause acute respiratory syndrome so far 7 types of them have been identified gorbalenya 2020 roush et al 2019 the transmission and evolution of the sars-cov-2 from bats to scaly anteaters pangolins and then to humans has been reported dehghani and kassiri 2020 this process is now present in humans through aerosols but transmission through secretions such as stool has not been confirmed in addition to these cases the transfer through bandages can also be considered there have been no reports of sars-cov-2 transmission by blood-borne arthropods such as mosquitoes shankar et al 2020 wu and mcgoogan 2020 some studies have associated insects such as beetles and domestic insects which are the main mechanical carriers of pathogens by contact with contaminated surfaces and patients secretions involved in transmission graczyk et al 2005 kobayashi et al 1999 vazirianzadeh et al 2014 sars-cov-2 excretion by stool has been confirmed in some patients therefore feeding domestic insects and beetles from the stool and its mechanical transmission can play a significant role in the transmission of the disease parry 2004 they can transmit more than 100 pathogens through the legs body hair mouth feces and vomit in this regard the elimination of mechanical carriers is very important not only in residential homes but also in public places there are several ways to control these organisms including improving environmental hygiene such as putting garbage in closed bags and trash cans controlling sanitary landfills sanitary toilets proper sewage disposal systems and preventing the accumulation of manure nearby and residential areas jobara 2016 clinical and laboratory wastes from sars-cov-2 detection in suspected individuals secretions such as blood 1 and feces 26 can also be a major source of the virus chang et al 2020 iwen et al 2020 but no study has shown the presence of the virus in the urine wang et al 2020c finally if such waste is not properly managed sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through mechanical transmission by insects cdc 2020ahuman-to-human transmission of the sars-cov-2 occurs most often when people are in the communal stage of the disease or carrier and have no symptoms or when they are with mild symptoms the important ways of transmitting the virus are through droplets infected hands and skin-to-skin contact as well as inanimate surface contact kampf et al 2020 studies show that sars-cov-2 stays for more than 9 days and be resistant like other coronaviruses such as sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers can live on inanimate surfaces such as metals glass and plastic at room temperature also at ambient temperatures of 30 c and above the duration of sars-cov-2 is reduced kampf et al 2020 some studies have suggested that a temperature of 56 oc for 90 min or a temperature of 67 oc for 60 min can cause sars-cov-2 to be inactive henwood 2020 kampf et al 2020 showed that at room temperature and 50 humidity the resistance of the virus was more than 30 in one study the stability of sars-cov-2 on different surfaces confirmed that the virus was more resistant to smooth surfaces than others according to the results of this study the virus remains stable at temperatures of 22 oc and relative humidity of 65 for 4 days on surfaces such as glass and banknotes and 7 days on smooth surfaces such as steel and plastic it also stays on rough surfaces such as fabric and wood for up to 2 days chin et al 2020 another investigation which examined environmental levels of sars-cov-2 virus in hospital centers found that the most important environmental levels of infection were self-service printers 20 used in chinese laboratories desktops and keyboards 168 door handles 16 telephones 125 and medical equipment 125 ye et al 2020 studies show that students touch their face with their hands an average of 23 times an hour 56 of it is the touch of the skin 36 is the lips 31 is the nose and 31 is the eyes kwok et al 2015 although sars-cov-2 is not available on the surface of complete information on viral load it can be said that by reducing the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces the amount of virus load on surfaces can be reduced kampf et al 2020 the who has recommended that cleanliness be done with water and detergents to ensure environmental cleanliness and then the use of common environmental disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite who 2020c the most well-known methods of surface disinfection to remove sars-cov-2 virus are in short the use of ethyl alcohol 6270 or hydrogen peroxide 05 or sodium hypochlorite 01 dilution ratio 1 to 50 with a contact time of 1 min henwood 2020 who 2014 other biocidal agents such as benzalkonium chloride 00502 or chlorhexidine digluconate 02 are also applicable but their effectiveness is less than previous who 2014 the effect of hand soap on disinfecting surfaces from the sars-cov-2 virus was investigated the results of this study show that the virus is inactivated by contact with soap for 5 min chin et al 2020 the cdc has also recommended a water temperature above 65 degrees to disinfect surfaces seymour et al 2020a one of the most important concerns at the pandemic period of coronavirus is disinfection and sterilization of surgical masks and n95 for reuse the significant thing is that these devices are disposable and cannot be reused in normal conditions however in cases of shortage and under certain conditions they can be reused up to 5 times by disinfecting and sterilizing them the use of thermal methods of at least 50 c for at 30 min is highly recommended as a disinfection and sterilization method for n95 masks in one study the use of uc radiation with a 100 wcm2 power with a contact time of 15 to 20 min for sterilization of n95 mask was suggested card et al 2020 in another study the use of hydrogen peroxide hp vapor was used in a short time to sterilize the n95 mask seymour et al 2020a hydrogen peroxide gas is suitable for disinfecting devices used for patients with viral infections it also does not hurt patients respiratory system and can be used to disinfect hospital rooms schwartz et al 2020apreliminary health advice when spreading epidemics is to observe hand hygiene and use ppe some of the reasons for not following the recommendations occur at the individual group and community levels at the time of the epidemic such issues are particularly well addressed among medical staff nevertheless some hand disinfectants are not effective in eliminating the pathogen pittet 2001 in other words a disinfectant should be used that will affect the pathogen and the virus in question at the same time as the covid-19 pandemic the effectiveness of hand sanitizers can prevent the virus from spreading because the main way to prevent the transmission of pathogens is body contact lack of public access to such materials is also a significant issue at this time the effectiveness of home disinfectants has been investigated by who seymour et al 2020d its main ingredients are alcohol glycerin and hydrogen peroxide after that spray on the hands and drying is done automatically by exposing it to the air lack of hand disinfection and contact with parts of the body ears eyes nose and mouth can cause covid-19 in one study alcohol-based hand rubs or soap and water hand wash were shown to be effective in preventing covid-19 sequentially if the disinfectant dries the above-mentioned items should be used again before contact with the patient or any use of the hand malhotra et al 2020 although there is evidence that hand hygiene can reduce respiratory illness it has not yet been proven that it can reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 yang 2020 so far no eye infections have been reported in patients with the sars-cov-2 but very few viruses have been seen in tears and conjunctival discharge it can be seen that the eye may not be the main entrance of sars-cov-2 into the body and cause respiratory infections sun et al 2020 however eye infections can be caused by respiratory and nasopharyngeal infections it can be very efficient especially during close contact between the patient and the clinical staff the use of masks and goggles along with hand disinfection has shown a significant reduction in person-to-person transmission yang 2020 also since sars-cov-2 is not only transmitted through the air and can survive on the surface for a while the importance of hand disinfection cannot be ignored otter et al 2016 besides infected people can contaminate the surface they touch which may include a large number of household items and appliances who 2020a in this way even infected people should disinfect their handsreviews of studies have shown that reducing the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces can reduce the amount of coronavirus load on surfaces and the rate of transmission the most important solution is to disinfect surfaces clean surfaces with water and detergents and then disinfect with ethyl alcohol 6271 or hydrogen peroxide 05 or sodium hypochlorite 01 with 1 min contact time despite the lack of evidence of sars-cov-2 transmission by blood-borne arthropods such as mosquitoes some studies have identified insects such as beetles and domestic insects which are the main mechanical carriers of pathogens through contact with contaminated surfaces and patients secretions also its transmission through the air with a minimum distance of 6 feet water and sewage and food has not been provided so faras the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic progresses one debate relates to the use of face masks by individuals in the community we previously highlighted some inconsistency in whos initial january 2020 guidance on this issue1 2 who had not yet recommended mass use of masks for healthy individuals in the community mass masking as a way to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in its interim guidance of april 6 20203 public health england phe has made a similar recommendation4 by contrast the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc now advises the wearing of cloth masks in public5 and many countries such as canada south korea and the czech republic require or advise their citizens to wear masks in public places6 7 8 an evidence review9 and analysis10 have supported mass masking in this pandemic there are suggestions that who and phe are revisiting the question11 12
people often wear masks to protect themselves but we suggest a stronger public health rationale is source control to protect others from respiratory droplets this approach is important because of possible asymptomatic transmissions of sars-cov-213 authorities such as who and phe have hitherto not recommended mass masking because they suggest there is no evidence that this approach prevents infection with respiratory viruses including sars-cov-23 4 previous research on the use of masks in non-health-care settings had predominantly focused on the protection of the wearers and was related to influenza or influenza-like illness14 these studies were not designed to evaluate mass masking in whole communities research has also not been done during a pandemic when mass masking compliance is high enough for its effectiveness to be assessed but absence of evidence of effectiveness from clinical trials on mass masking should not be equated with evidence of ineffectiveness there are mechanistic reasons for covering the mouth to reduce respiratory droplet transmission and indeed cough etiquette is based on these considerations and not on evidence from clinical trials14 evidence on non-pharmaceutical public health measures including use of masks to mitigate the risk and impact of pandemic influenza was reviewed by a workshop convened by who in 2019 the workshop concluded that although there was no evidence from trials of effectiveness in reducing transmission there is mechanistic plausibility for the potential effectiveness of this measure and it recommended that in a severe influenza pandemic use of masks in public should be considered15 dismissing a low-cost intervention such as mass masking as ineffective because there is no evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials is in our view potentially harmfulanother concern is the shortage of mask supply in the community medical masks must be reserved for health-care workers yet to control the infection source rather than to self-protect we believe that cloth masks as recommended by the cdc5 are likely to be adequate especially if everyone wears a mask cloth masks can be easily manufactured or made at home and reused after washing authorities also worry about correct techniques for wearing removal and disposal of face masks but these techniques could be learned through public educationfinally there are concerns that mask wearing could engender a false sense of security in relation to other methods of infection control such as social distancing and handwashing we are unaware of any empirical evidence that wearing masks would mean other approaches to infection control would be overlooked it is important however to emphasise the importance of this point to the public even if they choose to wear masks

mass masking is underpinned by basic public health principles that might not have been adequately appreciated by authorities or the public first controlling harms at source masking is at least as important as mitigation handwashing the population benefits of mass masking can also be conceptualised as a so-called prevention paradoxie interventions that bring moderate benefits to individuals but have large population benefits16 seatbelt wearing is one such example additionally use of masks in the community will only bring meaningful reduction of the effective reproduction number if masks are worn by most peopleakin to herd immunity after vaccination finally masking can be compared to safe driving other road users and pedestrians benefit from safe driving and if all drive carefully the risk of road traffic crashes is reducedsocial distancing and handwashing are of prime importance in the current lockdown we suggest mask wearing would complement these measures by controlling the harm at source mass masking would be of particular importance for the protection of essential workers who cannot stay at home as people return to work mass masking might help to reduce a likely increase in transmission south korea and hong kong have managed to limit their covid-19 outbreaks without lockdown17 18 it is difficult to apportion the contribution of various measures including extensive testing rigorous contact tracing and strict isolation but use of masks in public is universally practised in these two places we encourage consideration of mass masking during the coming phases of the covid-19 pandemic which are expected to occur in the absence of an effective covid-19 vaccine19 finally this practice could also be useful for control of future influenza epidemicsmass masking for source control is in our view a useful and low-cost adjunct to social distancing and hand hygiene during the covid-19 pandemic this measure shifts the focus from self-protection to altruism actively involves every citizen and is a symbol of social solidarity in the global response to the pandemican epidemic triggered by the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 has recently become the focus of the scientific community attention 1 covid-19 represents the illness generated by this virus its clinical presentation ranges from being an asymptomatic infection to developing into a severe disease with high mortality rate 2 at the time of writing may 16 2020 over 4425485 covid-19 cases and 302059 death have been registered worldwide 3 in particular in egypt there are 11228 positive individuals and 592 death cases 4 now covid-19 has been classified as a pandemic by the world health organization it is both a highly contagious and a life-threatening disease 3 its reproduction ratio rr is defined as the expected number of cases generated by a single infected individual within a susceptible population 5 it varies between 24 and 27 6 these values are high compared to influenza rr  1318 7currently a fight is being undertaken against the covid-19 pandemic adherence to control and prevention steps is paramount for ensuring a complete success over covid-19 lessons were learned from the 2003 sars outbreak these indicate that fear exists within the population awareness and attitude to infectious diseases this factor may hinder further efforts to prevent the virus spread therefore it is crucial to understand covid-19 publics awareness at this critical stage to facilitate pandemic management 8 9as members of the health care team pharmacists play an essential role in patient care this includes contributing to the decision-making process within the multidisciplinary health care team taking responsibility for medication administration and assessment of patient care 10 moreover together with physicians pharmacists knowledge attitude and practices are crucial to prevent and control the disease 11 health care teams include pharmacists are responsible for providing knowledge delivering good quality management and protecting individuals from illness during epidemic prevalence period therefore pharmacy students education should include training in precautionary measures effective treatment and follow-up this is critical together with their behavior in these fields 12 normally training in disaster medicine occupy a very small place in regular medical curricula worldwide 13 therefore the present study was carried out to evaluate knowledge about covid-19 as an attempt to identify senior students degree of awareness and its effects furthermore this study objective aims to contribute in developing a fit for purpose education program that creates awareness among future practitioners to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study directly exploring senior pharmacy students knowledge attitudes and practice regarding this topicthis is an institutional based cross sectional study conducted in faculty of pharmacy at the british university in egypt during the period from april 28 2020 to april 30 2020 the targeted population included students who had completed  85 of the credit-hours required for graduationthe sample size was calculated by using the online sample size calculator raosoft based on an estimated population of 470 students in the final years year 4 and 5 and on the anticipated response of 50 the minimum required sample size was 204 participants with a confidence level of 95 and a 5 margin of errora pre-validated questionnaire 14 was modified after a comprehensive literature search and based on the most recent available information from the world health organization the center for disease control and prevention usa and the egypt ministry of health the initial draft was sent to a group of experts chosen according to their experience and expertise in related fields to appraise the questions in terms of relativity simplicity and importance then the questionnaire was sent by email through survey monkey software a pilot study was conducted on 10 subjects to test the questionnaire validity following a group discussion the questionnaire was completed the data from the pilot study was removed from the final analysisthe questionnaire included two sections demographics and knowledge attitudes and practices questions kap demographic variables included age gender and place of current residence cairo other governorates in egypt the first part of the kap represented the knowledge investigation consisting of 12 questions fig 1 4 questions were about covid-19 clinical presentations k1-k4 3 asked about transmission routes k5-k7 and the following 5 questions quizzed on prevention and control k8-k12 these questions were answered on a truefalse basis including an additional i dont know option one point was assigned to a correct response while no points were given for an incorrectunknown answer the total score ranged from 0 to 12 with a higher score suggesting better covid-19 awareness in the pilot sample the knowledge questionnaire cronbachs alpha coefficient was 073 indicating reasonable internal consistency 15attitudes towards covid-19 were appraised with 2 questions a1-a2 fig 2 that asked about the level of agreement on the covid-19 control implementations and the confidence perception for winning the war against this coronavirus the assessment of students practices was performed through 4 questions p1-p4 fig 2 that investigated their actions towards going to a crowded place wearing masks when going out in recent days maintaining social distance between others and if they agree that patients should disclose their exposure to covid-19 finally one last question was added to inquire about the students source of covid-19 informationbefore study start-up permission was taken from the ethics committee of the faculty of pharmacy at the british university in egypt the participants were briefed about the study rationale and were reassured about the confidentiality safeguards for their personal information and responses the answered survey submission was considered as consent for study participation respondents participation was completely consensual anonymous and voluntarythe completed questionnaires data were analyzed using the statistical package for social science version 210 spss 200 chicago il the significance level was set at a value of p  005 for all analyses initially all information gathered through the questionnaire was coded into variables in the pilot study the cronbachs alpha coefficient test was used to measure internal consistency data normality was tested using the kolmogorovsmirnov test descriptive and inferential statistics involving chi-square test mannwhitney u test correlation and logistic regression were used to analyze the resultsin the present study the scoring system and categorization were utilized to assess knowledge levels towards the covid-19 pandemic the questions determination was based on one point for every correct answer and zero points for false answers by adding the results of all the knowledge questions in the survey the participants mean knowledge scores kss were determined ks ranged from 0 to 12 with the higher scores demonstrating an increased level of pandemic covid-19 knowledge knowledge level categories were defined by an 80 cut-off point as any score above 80 is good and any score below 80 is poor 16during the course of this study a total of 248 participants completed the devised online survey questions after excluding 10 respondents who participated in the pilot study the final sample consisted of 238 participant students among these the average age measured in years was 22  1 166 students 70 were females when identifying the place of residence 149 students 63 were living in greater cairo while 89 37 resided in other governorates table 1 with regards to the students source of information results disclosed that the main source of information was social media 70 followed by published articles 48 and television 48in the present study the main objective was to measure covid-19 related knowledge of pharmacy senior students the mean score of covid-19 related knowledge was 83 10  12 ranging from 4 to 12 table 1 in particular 725 of the students possessed a good knowledge level while 235 displayed poor knowledge based on an 80 cut-off point 16 the first 4 survey questions k1-k4 measured students knowledge towards covid-19 clinical presentations the highest correct answer rate 98 related to the covid-19 related knowledge items identified by 2 questions the main clinical symptoms of covid-19 are fever tiredness and dry cough true and older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure heart disease lung disease cancer or diabetes appear to develop serious illness with covid-19 more often than others truefig 1 however the item with the lowest correct-answer rates was coagulation dysfunction is one of the major causes for death in patients with severe covid-19 true 37 fig 1 the answer i dont know was selected by 12 of students for the question covid-19 may cause aches and pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea in some patients fig 1 then the following 3 questions k5-k7 measured students knowledge towards the transmission routes in this case the percentage of knowledgeable students is high k5 no transmission if fever is not present 88 k6 covid-19 can spread from person to person through small droplets 98 and k7 wear a mask only if you are ill or looking after someone who may have covid-19 96 a similar result was achieved with the next 5 questions k8-k12 which concerned assessing knowledge about covid-19 prevention and control fig 1 this study showed a significant relation between the knowledge score and published articles as source of information p  005the students attitude was measured with 2 questions the highest positive result was attained by the following covid-19-related attitude item are you confident that the health care team and scientists can win the fight against the covid-19 virus 87 answered yes however the lowest positive attitude result corresponded to the following do you agree that covid-19 will be successfully controlled only 72 answered yes fig 2the highest performance rate was attained by the following covid-19-related practice item in recent days have you gone to any crowded place 87 answered no however the item with the lowest performance rate was in recent days if you left your house have you worn a mask when leaving home 505 gave a negative answer fig 2 as expected it was found that the covid-19 practice for going out in crowded place was significantly different between males and females females displayed a lower tendency to go out than males p  005 in addition the practice for keeping social distance between students was significantly different between males and females females maintained social distance more successfully than males p  005 it is worth mentioning that significant relations existed between the two practices and the students source of information in particular the practice of wearing a mask when leaving home was directly correlated with using television as source of information p  005 furthermore the practice of keeping social distance of at least 2 m from other people was directly associated with utilizing physicians advice as source of information p  005moreover the correlation coefficient existing between the major knowledge attitude and practice variables was analyzed a weak positive correlation was observed between attitude and practice and this result appeared to be highly significant r  02 p  001 however no correlation appeared to exist between knowledge and attitudes or knowledge and practice table 2logistic regression analyses showed that students with a good knowledge score are 22 times more optimistic and agreed that covid-19 will be successfully controlled 95 confidence interval ci 103472 students who live in cairo were 17 times more likely to maintain social distance of at least 2 m from other people 95 confidence interval ci 0932 and 17 times more likely to agree that patients should disclose potential covid-19 exposure than students who live in other governorates in egypt 95 confidence interval ci 0933 moreover female students were 36 times more likely to avoid going to any crowded place than male students 95 confidence interval ci 1586 and 23 times more likely to keep their social distance of at least 2 m from other people than male students 95 confidence interval ci 1244 table 3the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an emerging contagious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus it was first detected in december 2019 in wuhan china 17 emerging infectious diseases like covid-19 can occur anywhere in the world by being part of the health care team pharmacists can be exposed to the risk of infection 18 here we present the results of a questionnaire study about the knowledge attitudes and practices of egyptian senior pharmacy students towards the covd-19 diseasein the present study one of the most significant findings was that the highest main source of covid-19 information among senior students was social media television and published articles the results strongly support similar findings in which the main source of middle east respiratory syndrome mers information was reported to be the internet and social media 19 this clearly indicates that senior pharmacy students are relying consistently on the internet social media and online information as the principal ways to obtain information compared with friends and other resources the egyptian ministry of health and population and the world health organization who have provided clusters with covid-19 information through their websites and are recommending everyone to be aware of updates relating to knowledge about covid-19 3 4 similarly a previous study reported that internet was the main source of information about mers-cov 20 therefore it is feasible to suggest that researches should urgently find ways to utilize the internet to promote health especially in emerging infectious diseases and pandemics at present the quality of the information available on the internet is insufficient and needs to be revised furthermore a very small percentage of participants reported that healthcare professionals either physicians or pharmacists were their primary source of information this scenario illustrates the lack of healthcare team engagement in increasing the public awareness regarding different aspects of covid-19the present study showed a significant relation existing between the knowledge score and published articles as source of information p  005 that may be due to the role played by the who and the egyptian ministry of health and population in providing cluster with covid-19 information through their websites therefore these organizations recommend everyone to be aware of updates about covid-19as mentioned earlier 238 senior pharmacy students participated in the present study the overall mean knowledge scored among students was 83 10  12 most of the students possessed a good covid-19 knowledge level 725 of the students possibly owing to the fact that the egyptian ministry of health and population mohp and the world health organization who are providing a significant amount of covid-19 information through their websites 3 4 the present study results showed that 98 of participants were knowledgeable about the main clinical symptoms of covid-19 in addition the same percentage of students knew that older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions were more liable to develop serious illness with covid-19 than others these findings confirm observations from previous studies which reported that the majority of participants believed that the disease is more dangerous for the elderly and for those suffering from chronic diseases 21 22the students were least knowledgeable towards the question of coagulation dysfunction being one of the major death causes in patients with severe covid-19 suitable remedial actions should be taken since vascular venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombosis risks have been documented in severe and critically ill covid-19 patients 23 24 a perceived lack of information regarding some of the covid-19 clinical presentation or preventive measures highlights the requirement for the inclusion of more training seminars in their courses this raises concerns regarding the ability of newly-graduated pharmacists to deal with the covid-19 pandemic disease or any other potential similar epidemic events also the students were least knowledgeable about when to wear masks masks and sanitizing products use has evolved since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic resulting in their rapid depletion lack of appropriate security measures represents a major concern for health workers this is a cause of concern in a highly populated country such as egypt where the public may experience anxiety and even panic feelings because basic protection measures are unavailable 25knowledge is a prerequisite for establishing positive attitudes and promoting positive behaviors therefore it makes sense to invest in individuals cognition towards the infection regarding the senior students attitude towards covid-19 in the present study 72 of them agreed that covid-19 will be successfully controlled and 87 were confident that health care teams and scientists can win the fight against the coronavirus interestingly it was found that a greater students knowledge relates to more confidence in covid-19 becoming successfully controlled or 22 95 confidence interval ci 103472correlation between the students attitude and practice indicates that their positive attitude is affecting their action towards covid-19 this present study results showed that 87 of participants did not go to any crowded place 76 of the students agreed that patients should disclose their exposure to covid-19 and 73 of the students kept the social distance of at least 2 m from other people however the students showed bad practice when using masks as a protective measure approximately 50 that was directly related to their lower level of knowledge towards the importance of wearing masks p  005 that is supported by findings from a previous study which reported that only about 35 of the participants were willing to wear face masks 21interestingly it was reported that females preferred not to go to any crowded place more than male students or 36 95 confidence interval ci 1586 in addition females preferred to keep the social distance more than male students or 23 95 confidence interval ci 1244 moreover students who live in other governorates kept social distance and agreed that patients should disclose their exposure to covid-19 rather than the students who live in the capital or 17 95 confidence interval ci 0932it is noteworthy that a significant association existed between the practice of wearing masks when leaving home and using television as source of information p  005 likewise an association existed between the practice of keeping the social distance at least 2 m from other people and utilizing physicians as a source of information p  005 this encourages the public to avoid public meetings including sports ceremonies meetings and school classes in order to prevent a global transmission of coronavirus infection 26 however many people ignore the importance of maintaining social distance because of attitudinal issuessome of the results of this study were compared with research on other new emerging infectious diseases similar to coronavirus because no analyses have been conducted concerning pharmacy students or students in generalthe year 2020 is definitely one to go down in the history books as new covid-19 cases continue to emerge with a global count of 6535354 cases and 387155 deaths as of 6th june 20201 healthy individuals have been advised to stay at home and follow self-quarantine regulations declared by local governance and world health organization who2 access to outdoor tracks has been denied and fitness centres have been closed for the prevention of community spread of the deadly virus prolonged stay at home could result in physical inactivity which could further lead to ill health sedentary behaviour any waking behaviour characterized by the energy expenditure of fewer than 15 mets in reclining or sitting postures is identified as a pleiotropic risk factor for cardiometabolic disease risks such as obesity coronary artery diseases hypertension and cancer disease3straying away from a sedentary lifestyle is essential especially in these troubled times of a global pandemic to reverse the ill effects associated with the health risks mentioned earlier exercising even at a low intensity is found to maintain the muscle mass cardiovascular fitness and prevent the bone loss that is imposed by the sedentary behaviour during this lockdown period4 owing to the current world scenario specific exercise guidelines have been proposed during the covid-19 lockdown period specifically for at-risk or chronically ill individuals 5 exercise training is anticipated to stave off or lessen the chances of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards associated with covid-196 in his systematic review zhan yan 2020 found that antioxidant extracellular superoxide dismutase ecsod associated with exercise training might be protective against covid-19 ards7 though moderate to vigorous exercise training is proposed to improve immune system8 few studies refute this proposition suggesting a window period for immunosuppression primarily reduction in cd4 cells after vigorous exercise or unaccustomed exercise performed for a longer duration  2hrsday dramatic reduction in cytotoxic t cells should be anticipated in sedentary individuals participating in the accustomed strenuous exercise9despite the conflicting evidence low-intensity exercise for sedentary individuals and moderate exercise for active individuals are recommended by center for disease control cdc and american college of sports medicine acsm to maintain cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness in global population10worldwide governments are slowly relaxing their national lockdowns even though the number of cases continues to rise although concerning it has still brought a sigh of relief to athletes as well as social exercisers who can resume their trainingfitness sessions and they can now be seen everywhere with facemasks however the wearing of facemasks to prevent the community spread of the novel covid-19 is itself debatable considering the limited evidence on the subject matter 11 who recommends masks only for covid-19 patients but the usage of masks is morally exploited among community individuals12 the present physiological hypothesis paper is an attempt to explore the unanswered questions 1 does the use of facemasks offer any benefit for social exercisers during this pandemic 2 does exercising with facemasks alter normal physiological responses to exercise 3 does exercising with facemasks increase the risk of falling prey to coronavirus 4 how could social exercisers combat the physiological alterationcoronavirus is known to spread via droplets and causes upper respiratory tract infections with ards respirator facemasks n95 serve as personal protective equipment that could filter fine airborne particles and prevent them from reaching the respiratory system as well as prevent inter-individual infections especially influenza and coronaviruses13 the current trend indicates the proclivity of coronavirus towards the nasal or oral cavity due to its lower temperature as compared to the core gupta et al 2020 proposed that facemasks may provide a therapeutic environment 95 f hot and 80 humid and act as a barrier against these viral impactions in the naso-oropharynx region14exercising with customized tight facemasks induces a hypercapnic hypoxia environment inadequate oxygen o2 and carbon dioxide co2 exchange15 this acidic environment both at the alveolar and blood vessels level induces numerous physiological alterations when exercising with facemasks 1 metabolic shift 2 cardiorespiratory stress 3 excretory system altercations 4 immune mechanism 5 brain and nervous system fig1
illustrates the possible physiological alterations while exercising with facemasksmuscle metabolism highly depends on the uninterrupted o2 supply and co2 exchange with the atmosphere the efficiency of muscle metabolism depends on patency of oropharynx autonomic stability cardiac fitness and muscle blood supply16 fat metabolism occurs at rest and low to moderate-intensity exercise sparing glucose but during moderate to vigorous intensity exercise anaerobic metabolism predominates and requires substantial o2 supply after cessation of the activity for the conversion of lactic acid the face mask forms a closed circuit for the inspired and expired air though not completely airtight rebreathing of the expired air increases arterial co2 concentrations and increases the intensity of acidity in the acidic environment17 thus individuals exercising with a mask would have physiological effects similar to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd person exercising such as discomfort fatigue dizziness headache shortness of breath muscular weakness and drowsiness18 besides light activity like walking with a met value of 2 could increase the amount of inhaled co2 and decrease the amount of o2 via an n95 mask increasing the work of breathing therefore we could assume this effect to magnify when performing any aerobic or resistance exercise at a higher workload the resistance offered to the inspiratory and expiratory flow for prolonged periods about 10 mins could result in respiratory alkalosis increased lactate levels and early fatigue 9 the aforementioned symptoms affect the exercising individuals psychologically as well as bring about physiological alterations such as muscle damage muscle fibre switch and fast-twitch fibres sizefurther poor saturation of haemoglobin would be anticipated due to increased partial pressure of co2 at higher exercise intensity19 fig2
demonstrates the extreme right shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve which would be higher than that expected during exercise this acidic environment would unload o2 faster at the muscle level but due to higher heart rate and reduced affinity at the alveolar junction the partial pressure of o2 would substantially fall creating a hypoxic environment for all vital organssubstantial evidence exists concerning the long term effects of exercise and the improvement in adaptive immunity20 though moderate exercise in the long run is found to increase natural killer cell count and downregulate inflammatory factors such as tumour necrosis factors acute bouts of vigorous exercise over a while may influence these changes negatively exercising with facemasks induces an acidic environment and thus mobility of hypoxic natural killer cells to the target cells would be affected aggravating the chances of infection during the pandemic a further change in humidity and temperature in the upper airway causes immotile cilia syndrome predisposing individuals to lower respiratory tract infections by deep seeding of oropharyngeal flora21the reduced availability of o2 and co2 would increase the heart rate and blood pressure exponentially even at low workloads this physiological alteration may increase aortic pressure and left ventricular pressures leading to an upsurge of cardiac overload and coronary demand22 further increased respiratory load against the valve breathing leads to increased respiratory muscle load and pulmonary artery pressure in turn adding to the cardiac overload these changes may be subtle in healthy individuals during exercise still in persons with established chronic illness these changes may aggravate the underlying pathophysiology leading to hospitalization or increased use of medicationhypercapnic hypoxia reduces renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate posing a risk of reduced renal functions thus aciduria and resulting tubular damage may potentially aggravate the compromised renal functions in individuals with established chronic diseases23 further the autonomic dysfunction and reduced immune responses increase the inflammatory substances such as c reactive protein interleukins il-6 il-12 resulting in generalized nephritis in chronic kidney failure patients24 additionally poor renal artery flow causes hypoxemia in nephrons perpetuating the pathophysiology of poor renal functionsacute hypercapnia a double-edged sword on the one hand elevates intracranial pressure lowers cerebral perfusion and triggers cerebral ischemia and on the other hand it is found to be neuroprotective decreasing the excitatory amino acids and minimizing the cerebral metabolism25 studies from obstructive sleep apnea26 provide irrefutable evidence of hypercapnic hypoxemia affecting the postural stability proprioception altered gait velocities and falls the above findings can be extrapolated to elderly persons as well as individuals with established respiratory diseases exercising with n95 respirator masksthough the respirator masks are perceived to be the barriers for preventing aerosol depositions to the respiratory tract the bitter reality is that masks increase the risk of more in-depth respiratory tract infections as quoted by perencevich et al 2020 the average healthy person shouldnt be wearing masks as it creates a false sense of security and people tend to touch their face more often when compared to not wearing masks 27 the surgical masks are debated to trap the droplets containing the virus inside increasing rather than reducing the risk of infectioneven with the usage of a protective face mask social distancing while exercising outdoors is essential to avoid the adverse effects of exercising with a face mask the individual should first be aware of their exercise limit low to moderate-intensity exercise would be beneficial and would help reduce the ill effects of mask breathing when experiencing symptoms of dizziness imbalance excessive fatigue 13 and shortness of breath it would be advisable to stop and take a break until symptoms subside intermittent atmospheric breathing without the mask would be beneficial to restore the normalcy of breathing and reducing the stress on the cardiopulmonary system in an area which is not densely occupied by people individuals with chronic diseases should avoid venturing outdoors to exercise home-based exercises performed under the supervision of a health professional would be preferred to avoid any adverse outcomesexercising with facemasks might increase pathophysiological risks of underlying chronic disease especially cardiovascular and metabolic risks social exercisers are recommended to do low to moderate-intensity exercise rather than vigorous exercise when they are wearing facemasks we also recommend people with chronic diseases to exercise alone at home under supervision when required without the use of facemasks given the identified and hypothesized risks social distancing and self-isolation appear to be better than wearing facemasks while exercising during this global crisisnonebaskaran

province 1 it was reported that most of these patients worked at or lived around the local huanan seafood wholesale market severe acute respiratory infection symptoms occurred in most patients with some patients rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory failure 2 on january 7 2020 a novel type of coronavirus was identified from the throat swab sample of a patient and was temporarily termed as 2019-ncov by the world health organization who on february 11 the pneumonia caused by 2019-ncov was formally named as covid-19 by who 3the 2019-ncov spreads rapidly mainly through droplet and contact transmission until march 3 2020 the number of confirmed cases reached more than 80000 according to the report from the national health commission nhc of china covid-19 was classified as one of the legal class b infectious diseases in china but taking the highest level of prevention and control measures according to the law of the peoples republic of china on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseaseson february 11 2020 diagnosis and treatment protocols of covid-19 infection 6th edition was published by nhc of china 4 it indicated that x-ray and computed tomography ct examinations were effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of this infectious disease 5 however most radiologists and radiological technologists in radiology departments had less experience when facing covid-19 patients examination with nonstandard prevention procedures will lead to high risks of hospital cross-infection in the radiology department in order to effectively reduce the infection risk of radiologists and radiological technologists a consensus on prevention and control measures in radiology department for covid-19 was presented under

emergency statements for seven prefectures saitama chiba tokyo kanagawa osaka hyogo and fukuoka where covid19 infection is spreading across the region and it expanded the national emergency declaration on april 16th facilities and stores that may come into intimate contact such as recreation facilities gyms and bars that serve alcohol at night are closed due to the governments refraining from doing business on the other hand grocery stores medical facilities public transportation banks etc which are essential to live are required to make efforts to shorten business hours and suppress heavy contact however those facilities have not been requested or instructed to be closed of the medical facilities hospitals that treat infected people are in a critical situation as in other countries because the number of infected people is increasing day by day the japanese society of infectious diseases announced that they should change the way of treatment of infectious diseases and announce the clinical response to new coronavirus infectious diseases to clinical sites involving medical treatment japanese prime minister shinzo abe emphasized that as far as possible not to go out for reasons that are not necessary or urgent but will not be blocked in order to reduce the economic pressure caused by new type covid19 to the people the government decided to issue 100000 yen per person to relieve the stress of new type covid19 on peoples livesat present the age of patients with onset in japan is widely distributed from children to the elderly but more than 90 of deaths are over 60 years old china italy and united states of america have reported cases of children dying of new type covid19 so we should pay take it as a big serious livingston  bucher 2020 sinha et al 2020 one of the three major festivals in japan gion festival held in kyoto has been cancelled in addition masks have become a necessity for people now it is difficult to get masks in japan although the japanese government has taken measures to deal with new type covid19 in the face of the epidemic it is better for us to wash our hands frequently ventilate frequently and avoid gatherings not to go out as less as possible if you have symptoms that are suspected of being infected you should do your own home isolation or follow the hospitals isolation treatment system this is an essential period for japanese fight against new covid19a few clinics and hospitals where infection has happened were already closed but most clinics that do not be required to be closed such as internal medicine ophthalmology otolaryngology and dermatology provide most of the usual medical care dental clinic is one of them for the time being the dental clinics offer the same treatment as usual what is a little different from usual is that while taking precautions to see patients with suspected covid19 infection those who have concentrated contacts with infected person or those who have symptoms due to the characteristics of the dental environment the risk of crossinfection between dentists and patients may be high in addition a large amount of droplets and aerosols may be generated during dental treatment but the standard protective measures in daily clinical work are not enough to prevent the spread of covid19 especially when the patients are in the incubation period are unknown of their infected or conceal their infection puisieux brabletz  caramel 2020 to prevent the spread of infection dentists are trying to prevent infection between patients and between patients and medical staffs

hidesuke tada writingoriginal draft wenhua shao writingoriginal draft naozumi ishimaru writingreview and editing yasusei kudo conceptualization writingreview and editingin 19 march 2020 world health organization has produced a document related to the use of medical masks in areas affected by novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 intended for control professionals healthcare managers healthcare workers and community health workers 1 regarding the use of face masks for civilians world health organization and us centers for disease control and prevention have both said that only people with covid-19 symptoms and those caring for them should wear masks 2 in details world health organization suggested to maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing as one of the basic protective measures against the new coronavirus 3 while us centers for disease control and prevention suggested about 6 feet or 2 meters distance from others 4 an interesting article has been recently published by l bourouiba in which she highlighted that these distances are based on estimates of range that have not considered the possible presence of a high-momentum cloud carrying the droplets long distances taking into account that spread during exhalations sneezes and coughs encompasses mucosalivary droplets following short-range semiballistic emission trajectories and multiphase turbulent gas cloud as well the author reported for these and other reasons wearing of appropriate personal protection equipment is vitally important for health care workers caring for patients who may be infected even if they are farther than 6 feet away from a patient 5 furthermore van doremalen et al published in the new england journal of medicine on 16 april 2020 a study regarding aerosol stability of sars-cov-2 compared with sars-cov-1 demonstrating that the results obtained indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of sars-cov-2 is plausible since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days depending on the inoculum shed
6 in this overall scenario the guardian reported on 1 april 2020 that world health organization considers changing guidance on wearing face masks because new evidence suggests wearing masks in public could help contain the pandemic 7 in addition leung et al reported in the article published in nature medicine on 03 april 2020 that our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals
8taking account the need of face masks for a huge number of people some countries have to face the issue of insufficient amount of personal protective equipment in italy this deficiency has boosted several industries to reset their production chain moving from their usually target manufacturing towards the production of personal protective equipment in order to match the large quantities requested for the safety of citizens this urgent request is encountering a barrier which entails the customization of the production to delivery effective medical and non-medical masksin this regard it is important to distinguish between medical masks for healthcare professionals and civil protection workers ffp2 and ffp3 and non-medical masks for civilians the production of medical masks needs to respect the following european standards namely i en 146832019 for the surgical masks  requirements and test methods which reports specification of construction design performance requirements and test methods for medical masks with the aim to limit the transmission of infective agents from staff to patients during surgical procedures ii en 1492009 for the respiratory protective devices ffp2 and ffp3 able to protect against particles the operator and not the patient these mask filters inhaled air but did not exhale air 9any other mask available on the market is not a medical device or an individual protection device to this purpose this type of masks can be produced based to the art 16 paragraph 2 of the italian legislative decree 182020 under the responsibility of the manufacturer who must in any case guarantee the safety of the product the materials used not cause irritation or any other harmful effect on health are not highly flammable etc these masks cannot be used in a hospital or healthcare environments as they do not have the technical requirements of medical devices and personal protective equipmentin 2002657ce concerning the performance of analytical methods and the interpretation of results european commission has defined screening method as methods that are used to detect the presence of a substance or class of substances at the level of interest these methods have the capability for a high sample throughput and are used to sift large numbers of samples for potential non-compliant results they are specifically designed to avoid false compliant results
10 the screening methods was then established as useful analytical tools for rapid and cost-effective analysis rendering the value chain of measure more sustainable indeed more analyses using screening methods rely on less analysis using confirmatory methods that required large and expensive instrumentation combined with skilled personnel 13to face the delivery of safe face masks in timely fashion arpa lazio together with department of chemical sciences and technologies of tor vergata university have collaborated to set-up a screening analytical system for fast evaluation of the capability of this type of masks to break down aerosol inspired by the activity of other groups 1112 herein we describe the set-up developed to deliver a smart analytical system able to simulate the inhalation and exhalation and measuring the aerosol able to pass through the face masks testeddifferent types of face masks fig 1
 were kindly supplied by companies whose names are omitted to avoid any form of publicity the medical masks were bought at local pharmacyanalytical instruments air cube gas was used to create a constant flow at 6 lmin while fai opc optical particle counter was used to measure the particles before and after the aerosol passes through the masksto evaluate the breaking down of aerosol through the face masks a system was built in laboratory creating two chambers divided by the tested face mask the first chamber chamber 1 highlighted in red in fig 2
b can be opened to load it with aerosol while the second one chamber 2 highlighted in green in fig 2b is closed and connected to vacuum pump for simulating the respiratory action the percentage of particles blocked by face mask tested is evaluated measuring the particles in chamber 1 loaded with aerosol and the particles in chamber 2 after the simulated respiratory action by the optical particle counterthe detailed procedure is shown in fig 2 in phase 1 the chamber 1 is filled with aqueous aerosol produced by a commercial ultrasonic vaporizer fig 2a and the particles present are measured by the optical particle counter phase 2 fig 2b after the vacuum pump is switched on for 2 seconds simulating a deep respiratory action phase 3 fig 2c which boosted the moving of the particles from chamber 1 to chamber 2 passing through the face mask then the passed particles in chamber 2 were measured phase 4 fig 2d the particle counter is able to detect particles starting from eight different dimensional ranges 028 04 05 07 11 20 30 50 m for each range the effectiveness of face mask for breaking down the aerosol was evaluated using the following equation eff  ni  nf ni  100 where ni is the count of the particles in chamber 1 while nf is the count of the particles in chamber 2 figure 2 shows the system made with material readily available in the laboratory the same apparatus made of methacrylate and equipped with the remote control of the aerosol provides the same resultsthe face masks were tested in the inhalation and exhalation direction by setting the face mask in the conventional use or in opposite sidethe analysis conditions were chosen in order to create in chamber 1 an atmosphere heavily contaminated by aerosol particles the flow rate of 6 lmin for 2 sec was chosen to simulate a deep single respiratory action the acquisition time of the particle counter was set at 1 min to deliver reproducible measurementsto assess the effectiveness of face masks at least 8 measurements for each type of masks were carried out evaluating both the response in inhalation and exhalation using different masks of the same batch in table 1
 the average filtration efficiency was reported taking into account the particles with diameters greater than 028 m the results obtained showed that the medical face mask is characterized by values higher than 97 while only the face masks fabricated with three layers mainly constituted by tnt non-woven fabric material are able to reach values higher than 95 these results are in agreement with a technical note of politecnico di milano which suggested the use of three layers and tnt as material 12to highlight the behavior of the breaking down of the aerosol particles at different dimensions in table 2
we reported all dimension ranges of particles analyzed before and after the passing through the medical mask non-medical masks type c and type d as depicted in table 2 the higher efficiency was observed at the higher particle dimensions in addition we reported also the measurement obtained when nitrogen was flown in chamber 2 observing a decrease of particles inside the chamber as expected the results obtained demonstrated that this method is able to discriminate easily the face masks suitable for aerosol breakdown suggesting that it can be used as a screening method to evaluate the produced face masks in this urgency situation in order to customize easily their productionthe issue of covid-19 is having a huge impact of in different sectors ranging from health system to agriculture in italy the deficiency of the medical face masks for the people involved in health system as well as of the non-medical face mask for the civilians has boosted several italian industries to change their value chain for medical and non-medical face mask fabrication to deliver medical face masks the produced masks needed to be subjected to different tests following the european standards namely en 146832019 and en 1492009 which required complex laboratory set-up and long analysis time herein we reported a set-up developed for screening analysis of medical face masks as well as for testing the non-medical face masks using optical particle counter technique which is used in en 7792012 to evaluate the filter filtration efficiency combined with pump able to simulate the respiratory action with the aim to deliver a simple analytical system for screening test of medical and non-medical face masks in timely fashion

 it was obtained from a survey from the hong kong public opinion research institute hkpori which carried three-cross sectional telephone survey among general adult population in hong kong with self-reporting of wearing a face mask when going out telephone numbers were randomly generated by computer system masking was not specifically defined but was generally understood by the public as surgical masks while some may use re-useable mask 1617 social distancing was widely practised by hong kong citizens with some government policy since 25th january 2020 including closure of all schools work from home policy for most government employees closure of recreational business and bars and ban on gathering of more than four people in public places 18 fig 1 as such for a city in close proximity to china hong kong has a relatively low case load of covid-19 whether universal masking can provide additional benefits on aecopd is the focus of our current studythis was a retrospective study to assess number of admissions for aecopd during the period of covid-19 in queen mary hospital qmh with reference to the admission number in the past 5 years qmh is a tertiary hospital provides acute care under hospital authority a public organization accountable for 90 of in-patient services in hong kong 19 the study period was january to march 2020 when world health organization who confirmed the novel coronavirus later called covid-19 infection on 9 january 2020 with the first imported case from wuhan to hong kong on 23 january 2020 patients above 45 years old with known copd admitted for aecopd from the period 1st january 2015 to 31st march 2020 were included in the study data was obtained by retrieval of admission records from the clinical data analysis and reporting system cdars of hospital authority principal diagnoses with icd-9 codes of 469 and 491 were searched on cdars inclusion criteria include 1 age above 45-year-old 2 with known diagnosis of copd 3 and with aecopd exclusion criteria include 1 age of 45-year-old or below 2 with copd admitted for causes of dyspnea other than aecopd 3 with coexisting pulmonary diseases including asthma-copd overlap syndrome and bronchiectasis which are being identified as the secondary diagnoses in cdars demographic data including age gender clinical datainvestigations including date of admission length of hospital stay blood and sputum culture results use of non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation were collected length of stay los and mortality were used as markers of severity of aecopd admission with longer length of stay and higher mortality indicated more severe condition of patients data on other acute admissions within the same period including heart failure icd-9 code 428 intestinal obstruction icd-9 code 560 and iron deficiency anaemia icd-9 code 280 were taken as control diagnoses these control diagnoses were taken as reference of health-seeking behavior during period of covid-19 with evaluating possibility of decreased hospital attendance due to various reasons including fear of being infected by covid-19 or not to overload hospital carepercentage of masking 16 air quality as measured by air quality health index aqhi temperature and incidence of influenza a and b in the period from january 2015 to march 2020 in hong kong were also collected and their associations with copd exacerbation were studied with highlights on the covid-19 period relationship between percentage of mask usage and aecopd was calculated with assumption of 1 on the period prior covid-19 in accounting for the pregnant lady and immunocompromised patients who were advised to wear masks aqhi was calculated by the hong kong environmental protection department hkepd based on the cumulative health risk attributable to a 3-h moving average concentrations of four air pollutants namely ozone o3 nitrogen dioxide no2 sulphur dioxide so2 and particulate matter pm25pm10 the aqhi system provided different health advice for people having different degree of susceptibility to air pollution including people with existing heart or respiratory illnesses children and the elderly outdoor workers and the general public it was reported in scale of 110 and 10 and grouped into five health risk categories namely low 13 moderate 46 high 7 very high 810 and serious 10 with different precautionary actions were advised people with respiratory illness were advised to reduced outdoor physical exertion and to minimize their stay in outdoor when aqhi was high very high or serious the aqhi was reported hourly in 13 stations located in different area of hong kong 20 the total number of hours with aqhi recorded as high very high or serious were summed up and expressed as percentage of total number of hours collected in a month log-linear model was used for statistical analysis of the possible association between aqhi and aecopd mean ambient temperature in degree celsius of each month was collected from the hong kong observatory 21 influenza incidence was collated from territory-wide laboratory surveillance data for both in-patients and out-patients in both public and private medical sectors from the centre for health protection hksar with relative static number of specimens collected over the period 22for statistical inference about the association between covariates air temperature aqhi and mask usage and admission count log-linear modeling was used in this study it was also applied for statistical inference for admission count between the three different time periods namely first three months of 2020 first three months of 20152019 and all months in 20152019 to balance the model fitness and complexity akaike information criterion aic was used for model selection both traditional asymptotic test statistics and bootstrapping were considered the later approach was a re-sampling method for statistical inference with less restrictive assumptions which can help to handle relatively small sample size it was designed to recover the distribution of model parameters and provided alternative estimates of key quantities such as confidence intervals and p-value based on some randomly shuffling the labels under the null hypothesis 2324 bootstrap sample size was set as 9999 to achieve adequate precision for significance two-sided tests were conducted for general differences and p  005 was taken as significant differences fisher exact test was used to compare the mortality rate and percentage of los of more than 5 days between the two time periods number of admission of the two time periods were classified into two categories for mortality deathalive or whether los exceeding 5 days and hence formed a 2-by-2 contingency table further details of these biostatistical methods are listed in appendix 1 the study was approved by the local institutional review board for ethical and scientific reviewfrom january 2015 to march 2020 total of 4749 admissions for aecopd were recorded of which 4627 admissions were from the period of 20152019 and 122 admissions in first three months of 2020 fig 2
 in the five-year period of 20152019 as a whole the monthly average number of admissions was 77 ranged from 66 to 89 in each year we observed that the admission for aecopd was highest in the first three months every year by averaging the total number of admissions in the first three months in each year of 20152019 the monthly admission count was 92 ranged from 81 to 105 in each year the average monthly aecopd admission was 41 in the first three months of 2020 table 1

the average monthly admission number for heart failure is 69 from 2015 to 2019 we observed a large decrease in admission between january and february 2015 and 2019 the average monthly admission number for heart failure was 73 in the first quarter of 2020 the effect of masking p  0217 aqhi p  0173 and temperature p  0250 were statistically insignificant the difference in admission number between periods was statistically insignificant table 1the average monthly admission for intestinal obstruction and iron deficiency anaemia were static over the period 2015 to 2020 average number of admissions was 24 per month for intestinal obstruction and 19 per month for iron deficiency anaemia fig 2 in the first three months of 2020 the average number of admissions for intestinal obstruction was 27 and for iron deficiency anaemia was 21 the effect of wearing facemasks aqhi and temperature were statistically insignificant the difference in admission number between periods was statistically insignificant table 1our study is the first to show the change in hospitalization number of aecopd during covid-19 pandemic and its relationship with percentage of masking temperature and air quality compared with other conditions that require hospitalization for management including heart failure intestinal obstruction and iron deficiency anaemia aecopd admission number in the first three months of 2020 was significantly lower when compared to the same periods in previous years the drastic drop in admission number cannot be fully explained by change in health-seeking behaviors in fear of attending hospitals as shown by admission of control diagnoses were not decreased the copd mortality and los more than 5 days were similar in the same period which suggested the severity of aecopd could be the same universal masking and higher temperature were shown to associate with decrease in aecopd the possible explanation could be universal masking and social distancing could effectively prevent respiratory tract infections and hence aecopd this was further supported by the drastic concomitant drop in number of influenza in hong kong in the same period the number of admissions of the conditions including heart failure intestinal obstruction and iron deficiency anaemia which are unaffected by universal masking was static these results suggested that the decrease in aecopd admission in the first quarter of 2020 was attributable to the effect from universal masking and social distancing which was vigorously practiced in hong kong in time of covid-19 pandemicworsening of air pollution with higher percentage of aqhi with high to serious was associated with more aecopd admission but was statistically insignificant in our study however air pollution is known to be associated with increase in aecopd and this should be acknowledged the statistical insignificance can be accountable by the relatively small variation of percentage with high to serious aqhi in the period ranges from 0 to 49 in the first quarter of yearsaecopd is one of the most important complications of copd which could lead to adverse outcomes prevention of recurrent aecopd is the main goal of respiratory physicians both non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies including standard treatment based on gold guideline and influenza and pneumococcal vaccine have been advocated but the number of hospitalizations for aecopd remained static over the past five years 25 26 27 28 29 the decrease in hospitalization number for aecopd in the first three months of 2020 coincided with the well-observed phenomenon of universal masking and social distancing in hong kong together with low case load and local transmission rate of covid-19 and low incidence of influenza apart from reducing covid-19 case numbers these measures were likely to bring about additional benefit for non-sars-cov-2 infected patients especially copd patients by protecting them against respiratory tract infection via air-borne or droplet transmission our study results suggested a possible link between universal masking and social distancing with decrease in aecopd admissionmasking and social distancing could also contribute to the decrease in number of influenza from january to march 2020 the number of influenza in january 2020 was close to previous years with 5154 cases with a drastic drop in february and march 2020 with commencement of universal masking and social distancing in end of january the magnitude of drop in influenza case number was not observed following an increase in influenza vaccination number from 579000 in year 20152016 to 1372300 in 20192020 hence cannot be completely accountable by seasonal influenza vaccination 30apart from the drop in aecopd in january to march 2020 we also observed there was a large decrease in admission for heart failure between january and february 2015 and 2019 yet there is no obvious reason accountable for the decrease in admission for heart failure in the period this phenomenon should be acknowledged that the drop on admission may or may not due to obvious external causeour observational study in hong kong suggested the benefits of masking and social distancing can potentially extend beyond prevention of covid-19 including early termination of influenza season and drop in the number of hospitalizations due to aecopd in the first quarter of 2020the potential limitation of this study was that it only involved a single centre qmh the centre served an area in hong kong with relatively stable population size with no major service change in the past five years 31 using districts with relatively stable population size and with only one acute hospital with accident and emergency department would remove the bias from population size change and also that from loss of patients due to admission to another centre within the same district this can also use as a reference for projection of the condition of healthcare system in hong kongmoreover our study only included patients with aecopd admitted to a regional tertiary hospital some patients with mild attack might visit outpatient clinics hence not all patients with aecopd were included however patients with severe attack who attended outpatient clinics are generally referred to emergency department and admitted hence they were included in our study our study focused on patient population with more severe symptoms who required hospital admission after triage by emergency department the severity of exacerbation was comparable with other period as shown by the length of stay and mortality dataour study showed the observational effect of decrease in aecopd with universal masking and social distancing which are both widely practiced in hong kong in covid-19 period both factors occurred together and the possible effect of each component on decrease in aecopd admission cannot be differentiated in our observational studythe number of admissions for aecopd decreased in the first three months of 2020 compared with the number in 20152019 in hong kong this was observed with the widely practice of universal masking and social distancing we postulated that universal masking and social distancing could prevented respiratory tract infections which were one of the triggers of aecopd hence was associated with decrease in aecopd during the covid-19 pandemic

china in december 2019 ghinai et al 2020 the 2019-ncov is from same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars community-acquired pneumonia cap and other common colds the 2019-ncov is a relatively large virus with a size of about 12 nm and is from a group of enveloped virus family containing a positive-sense single-stranded rna fehr and perlman 2015 ebrahimi et al 2020 the virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected persons respiratory droplets coughing and sneezing as well as contact with infected surfaces the 2019-ncov can survive for hours on surfaces but a simple disinfectant can eliminate it lai et al 2020a covid-19 signs and symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath in more severe cases the infection can lead to pneumonia or respiratory severe problems and ultimately in rare cases the disease will be fatal huang et al 2020ain the absence of a safe and effective vaccine as well as a lack of specific drug treatment the only solution is preventing its transmission performing general education and implementing appropriate prevention and control precautions can help people prevent risk of infection such as washing hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based disinfectant gel covering mouth with your bent napkin or elbow when sneezing or coughing avoiding close contact with those who have symptoms and being sure to see a doctor if have a fever cough or difficulty breathing haybar et al 2020 the virus transfers through direct and close contact with respiratory droplets of the affected person cough or sneeze or contact

temperature on prolonging the viruss half-life at high humidity could help the 2019-ncov spread under these conditions in spite of several clinical studies that claimed that spreading the virus into droplets can be prevented using appropriate masks it is challenging to prevent it from spreading into aerosol forms as well as the type of mask makes no significant difference long et al 2020 wang et al 2020b subsequent studies showed that viruses that had become airborne aerosols and spread through defective sewage were the possible cause of the sars coronavirus that killed lots of people in hong kong in 2003 yu et al 2004 in the same year only one incident in sars contaminated 22 out of 120 passengers on a 3-h flight olsen et al 2003 surprisingly the contamination included people who were outside the persons 2-m distance and viruses could not be transmitted to them through aerosols and droplets la rosa et al 2013 although it is difficult to prove that the virus has spread only through aerosols and droplets the relatively low humidity of the aircraft has undoubtedly contributed to the higher survival of the sars virus in the particles but a later study did not observe that transmission of sars-associated coronavirus and suggested that the risk of transmission is not amplified aboard aircraft vogt et al 2006a research report from canada points to the fact that open oxygen masks can help to spread disease agents such as sars in fact viruses such as sars are transmitted through the droplets emitted from these masks somogyi et al 2004 air exhaled through the oxygen masks transmits viruses in the droplets farther away increasing the risk of the respiratory disease spreading to health facilities further research is needed to fully determine that the sars virus and similar viruses can survive and stay live and spreadable in the warm and humid environment of oxygenated airresearch findings on the impact of humidity and temperature on the survival of the virus in airborne particulate matter indicate contrary to that li et al conducted a comprehensive study on the spread of the sars virus at the hong kong hospital and found evidence of the transmission of the virus aerosols they also suggested improving the air conditioning or ventilation system to reduce the risk of spreading such diseases li et al 2005 the 2019-ncov is claimed does not survive at temperatures above 26 c but it can survive for approximately 510 min on the skin 6 to 12 h on plastic materials and 12 h on metal fig 2because safety and ethical considerations do not allow the covid-19 infection test on the human specimen researchers used human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e as a surrogate to study the survival of the coronavirus on human hands initial findings from these tests show that about 45 of hand-infected viruses survive and remain viable after 1 h warnes et al 2015 such a survival time is much longer than other viruses such as the para-influenza virus type 3 which disappears after only 10 min in another study researchers used human fingers to show that by washing only with water the concentration of hcov-229e was reduced by 70 however with the use of hand-sanitized alcoholic disinfectants the concentration of this virus decreased by 9999 within 30 s geller et al 2012 this study highlights the importance of effective hygiene and disinfection preventing and controlling of infectious diseases caused by coronavirus familythere is no evidence that corona is transmitted through food or drinking water and recreational water one study shows that sars in the water can survive to a very limited degree wang et al 2005coronavirus is more stable and more resistant to environmental surfaces than other coated viruses warnes et al 2015 otter et al 2016 recently molecular methods such as pcr have been studied for the transmission of pathogens to the environmental surfaces of aircraft maris 1990 however the detection of pathogenic viruses in environmental samples seems to be necessary to assess their potential ability to infect and spread the disease mathematical simulations also confirm the fact that environmental levels play an essential role in the spread of coronavirus in health facilities ikonen et al 2018three-level biosafety has been suggested for protectivity 1 level 1 protection disposable hats disposable surgical masks disposable isolation clothing and disposable gloves wang et al 2020c 2 level 2 protection level 1 but with medical protective masks such as n95 goggles or protective masks and as outer cover a medical protective suit 3 level 3 protection level 2 but with the addition of face mask or a medical mask goggles or face mask to a full set or with an electric air filter respirator pei et al 2020wearing a face mask is suggested for healthcare workers and people who have respiratory symptoms but is not recommended for healthy people organization wh 2020a nonmedical masks made of other materials such as cotton fabric has not been well evaluated esposito and principi 2020scientific research to date on the covid-19 has yielded no conclusions that the covid-19 outbreak will decline with the start of the warm season many researchers have said it is too early to predict whether the covid-19 will decrease as the season progresses mahase 2020 studies have hypothesized that areas where covid-19 has suffered the most have similar weather patterns lipsitch et al 2020 countries located in the east and west of the globe did not have a significant impact on the prevalence of the disease among communities and on the other hand the north and south have provided a model for the relative prediction of disease outbreaks gates 2020 but now scenario has changed and countries located on east and west of globes usa  japan have already declared emergency and this statement was in contradiction with reality also it is estimated that this disease will reach saturation in the usa in july 2020 arias velsquez and meja lara 2020 and outbreak of covid-19 significantly correlated with average temperature minimum temperature and air quality bashir and ma 2020there are striking similarities between average wuhan city air temperature in january time of outbreak here and other polluted places in february as well as their humidity vetter et al 2020 the temperature at meteorological stations in these areas between 4 and 9 c and in cities due to urban factors has been slightly above and between 5 and 11 c sajadi et al 2020b it can also be predicted that with the onset of summer in northern hemisphere of the covid-19 it may be slightly influenza-like in the tropics and spread simultaneously in the southern hemisphere anderson et al 2020in addition to known factors influencing the transmission of viruses such as population displacement and human-to-human contact environmental factors can affect transmission of droplets and the viruss survival but for covid-19 disease the evidence is still very limited absolute humidity which is defined as water in the ambient air is considered a robust environmental factor for virus transmission huang et al 2020b oliveiros et al 2020 islam et al 2020 qi et al 2020 berumen et al 2020 guo et al 2020 barreca and shimshack 2012 in examining the relationship between climate and sars-cov-2 it is important to note that different regions of the world which have had a high prevalence in recent weeks have had different climates also no significant relationship has been found so far sajadi et al 2020b table 1 in analysis of regional regression countries affected by high prevalence of disease are divided into different regions and in these regions climate will be examined and recorded in several changes then for first period from first day of outbreak to day of study regression of daily aggregate growth against average temperature and relative humidity will be taken bukhari and jameel 2020b in this model we try to control variables such as population and gdp table 1 however temperature was not associated with epidemic growth of covid-19 and case counts zhu and xie 2020in a study by wang et al the effect of air temperature and relative humidity on the transmission of 2019-ncov from 105 samples of viruses carrying infected and contaminated pairs calculated the number of daily virus production per 100 chinese cities with more than 40 confirmed cases they reported that high temperatures and high humidity significantly reduced transmission of virus respectively also 1 c significantly reduces temperature increase and 1 decrease in relative humidity of daily virus production previous studies have shown that high temperature and humidity reduce the transmission of influenza and sars which is consistent with wang et als study this study showed that the arrival of summer and rain in the northern hemisphere might effectively reduce 2019-ncov transmission wang et al 2020ain a study by lou et al they looked at the number of covid-19 reproductions across chinas provinces and found that rising temperatures and humidity necessitated the arrival of spring and summer in the northern hemisphere alone without extensive public health interventions it does not reduce the number of viruses luo et al 2020 therefore it is important to understand the impact of environmental factors on the increasing prevalence of covid-19 to support disease control decisions ma et al 2020 it is especially important in areas with high temperatures and humidity where the risk of transmission is minimized shi et al 2020 distribution of significant disease prevalence in the community at limited latitude and longitude temperature and humidity is consistent with the behavior of seasonal respiratory viruses due to the fact that temperature and humidity are known factors in the survival of sars-cov mers-cov and influenza chan et al 2011 the prevalence of covid-19 in long periods of time has occurred at certain levels of temperature so that conditions of prolonged exposure to this temperature range increase the risk of disease outbreak rahman et al 2020b in addition to prolonging half-life and survival of virus other possible mechanisms related to temperature and humidity including droplet stabilization and increased virus spread in the nasal mucosa like other respiratory viruses are further evidence that these two factors affect 2019-ncov schaffer et al 1976 shirbandi et al 2020 it is important to note that although colder areas are relatively free of 2019-ncov they can affect the survival of the virus due to the low freezing cycle lamarre and talbot 1989 the researchers also found that low humidity was a factor in transmission of influenza in laboratory and onset of seasonal flu lowen et al 2007 shaman et al 2009many researchers and politicians have suggested that the covid-19 disease will go away on its own in warmer weather in the coming months in the northern hemisphere roy 2020 some have even said that the sars experience in 2003 is an evidence of this claim what can now be said in response to this claim based on existing studies is that it is possible to reduce the transmission of 2019-ncov in hot and humid weather with the closure of gathering centers such as schools and universities but it is not logical because these reductions do not occur alone or without any effective public healthrelated intervention it should be noted that even sars does not disappear for natural reasons but does not survive due to very severe public health interventions these include isolating and quarantining infected people and people in contact with them social distancing and other targeted actionstherefore it can be concluded that in case of 2019-ncov it is expected that like other beta-coronaviruses virus may be slightly more effective at low temperatures such as in winter although the underlying mechanism is not well-known therefore the size of this change in transmission and pathogenicity of the virus is expected to be moderate and will not stop by itself comparing to the pandemic the 2019-ncov is expected to be less immune to humans and even easily transmitted outside the cold season changing seasons and closing down gathering centers such as schools and universities may help but it is unlikely to stop the transmission of the virus to make effective policy it is necessary to determine whether the closure of gathering centers such as schools and universities may help to reduce the rate of transfer effectively in which if it would not be effective the resources are wasted during such closures for example recent evidence suggests that children may be as susceptible as adults bi et al 2020 so the critical question is whether the virus is easily transmitted under different temperature and humidity conditions finally except for a limited number of articles it is currently being published and shows that there is no conflict in the results regarding the effect of these two variables on the survival and transmission of the virusthe more practical and quantitative method of qct-2 showed that ethanol could kill 999 of hcov-229e policy et al nd other studies showed that alcohol-based mixture such as lozenge that contains amyl meta-cresol and dichlorobenzene alcohol could have direct and significant effects in reducing the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov oxford et al 2005 morokutti-kurz et al 2017 another research evaluated the impact of alcohol-based hand sanitizer on positive cases of mers-cov and showed that using this mixture had a significant increase in the utilized amount of virus as well as hand hygiene compliance rates increased to 88 al-tawfiq et al 2019formaldehyde 4 is used as a complete sterilizer and disinfectant however for safety reasons its use as a regular disinfectant is not recommended this disinfectant can kill the tgv virus in 99999 in 5 min and a 2 solution can kill more than 999 of hcov-229e sattar et al 1989phenolic-based ingredients have a long history of using coal tar soap with creosol although some disinfectants use the same historically active chemical changes in creosol have been made to make them more effective against germs for example o-phenyl phenol with a concentration of 200 ppm is quite effective against coronavirus sattar et al 1989 however adding detergent or ethanol can increase its effectiveness and eliminate 999 of the hcov-229e within 5 min similarly chemicals made from phenolics need other helpers to be effective shah et al 2020many studies were ongoing according to clinicaltrialsgov database according to this database bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccine which primarily used against tuberculosis tb will be intervening other vaccines such as inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine lv-smenp-dc vaccine measles-mumps-rubella vaccine autologous dendritic cells loaded with sars-cov-2 antigens av-covid-19 chadox1 ncov-19 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb igm and igg antibodies vpm1002 development of the bcg vaccine and adoptive cellular transfer act are ongoing there are no food and drug administration fdaapproved vaccines to prevent or trial covid-19 however fda issued emergency use authorization eua for emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients grein et al 2020the scientific evidence in this review article suggests that the spread of 2019-ncov may be influenced by climatic variables such as temperature and humidity apparently warm humid weather may indicate less transmission of the 2019-ncov considering the topic that seems to impose both the positive and negative data on the possible effect of environmental factors especially humidity and temperature on the stability and transmissibility of the 2019-ncov almost all available evidence revealed the possible positive effectcountries located in the east and west of the globe did not have a significant impact on the prevalence of the disease among communities and on the other hand the north and south have provided a model for the relative prediction of disease outbreaks gates 2020 the government and public health organizations can take steps to reduce the rate of covid-19 transmission in the future for example in addition to helping their people leading countries can help low- and middle-income countries lmics prepare for the epidemic and most effectively fight against the disease khadka et al 2020many lmic health systems are now vulnerable and a pathogen such as covid-19 can quickly lead to serious problems and challenges and eventually collapse of healthcare system given the natural inclination of richer countries to give priority to their own people over other countries this has led to a political and economic leverage in poor countries pioneer countries can save the lives of their own people by slowing the global transmission of the covid-19 by helping to prepare african and south asian countries to fight the disease gates 2020helping lmic is essential to strengthening the primary care system with the infrastructure to fight epidemics well-trained healthcare workers not only provide vaccines but also monitor disease patterns as part of early warning systems that warn the world of a possible outbreak given the limited testing capacity in african countries the numbers of confirmed cases of covid-19 may greatly underestimate the true burden although there was little evidence of unexplained outbreaks of the virus at face value the figures suggest that an african continent people had suffered fewer covid-19 deaths than the top list countries such as usa russia and uk zhao et al 2020b khafaie and rahim 2020baccording to epidemiologists 2019-ncov is not among the thermophile viruses so it will become inactive once the cold season begins however others suggested that 2019-ncov disappears at 30 c which is a misconception about the virus it is also reported in the multimedia that it is better to use fried food to eliminate covid-19 while the virus is cold-friendly and will survive longer with lower temperatures based on the results of new studies on the 2019-ncov the virus can survive on the surface for 4 to 28 days but if the temperature drops to less than 30 to 40 c the life span of the virus will be reduced rather than eliminated casanova et al 2010 some scholars think that if the temperature reaches 30 c the virus will not survive which is a misconception because at this temperature the viruss survival will reduce and does not mean that the virus will completely eliminate wang et al 2020a since the bats body temperature is 48 c so the 2019-ncov has nothing to do with these creatures levesque et al 2016 the virus is also sensitive to humidity in addition to temperature therefore sars coronavirus and possibly 2019-ncov have a longer life span of 50 than 30 humidity chan et al 2011 according to published data the human coronavirus can survive at temperatures of 20 c for up to 9 days and if the temperature rises to more than 30 c it perhaps decreases 2019-ncov viability but the lower the temperature is associated with the more virus activity in such a way that it can continue its activity for up to 28 days casanova et al 2010 thus the most effective way to reduce the activity of this virus is to use disinfectants such as ethanol 70 these types of substances can kill the virus within a short minutecurrently in a modeling study using the classification of covid-19 confirmed cases was investigated as one of the epidemic diseases consequentially the average daily temperature and relative humidity of hubei province in china and the number of covid-19 confirmed cases were selected they demonstrated that the relative humidity and the maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases the daily temperature and relative humidity affected 2019-ncov positively and extreme daily temperature with an average of 154 c affected this virus negatively pirouz et al 2020 recently a published evidence reports that 2019-ncov significantly contaminates air surface environment and protective equipment by droplets of an infected person meaning that environment is an important issue to consider because it is a potential medium of transmission thus it is necessary for strict adherence to environmental and personal protection and hygiene as well as social distancing ong et al 2020we are poorly aware of their survival in the environment and the precise factors of their transmission however limited studies in this field show that 2019-ncov is more resistant to environmental factors than other coated viruses the environmental conditions necessary for the survival and spread of 2019-ncov are somewhat clear but unlike animal coronaviruses the effect of humidity and temperature on the 2019-ncov activity is controversial researchers in the field of epidemiologists believe that the 2019-ncov is not a thermophilic virus so it will be activated with the onset of the cold seasonaccording to published data human coronavirus can survive for up to 9 days at 25 c and if this temperature rises to 30 c its lifespan will be shorter the 2019-ncov is sensitive to humidity and the lifespan of viruses in 50 humidity is longer than that of 30 also temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the covid-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-ncov transmission seasonal factors are recognized to play an essential role in the transmission of viruses responsible for various respiratory diseases besides most of these diseases reach epidemic proportions and key outbreak during winter recently researchers claimed that the two main causes contribute to the description of any association between viral outbreak and the seasonal factors including changes in environmental parameters and human behavior specifically changes in temperature and humidity disturb the viral stability and transmissibility thus considering the recent and available evidence it seems that low temperature as well as dry and unventilated air may affect the stability and transmissibility of the 2019-ncovthe coronavirus 2019 covid-19 pandemic presented in wuhan china and has so far affected more than 4 million people worldwide may 9 2020 with a mortality range of almost 7 1 interestingly the majority of people infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 have mild disease that does not require hospitalization 2 covid-19 appears to be transmitted human-to-human via droplets ie when a person coughs sneezes or talks loudly or via direct contact ie contact of a contaminated hand with the mouth nose or eye conjunctiva 3 infection has been estimated to have an incubation period of 214 days mean 64 days 3 asymptomatic patients in the incubation period may potentially transmit the virus 4 moreover children with covid-19 may have mild symptoms or may be asymptomatic 3 for these two reasons the temporary closure of schools and daycare facilities has been employed as a containment measureultrasonography us is widely used in children and can be performed in radiology departments of general or dedicated paediatric hospitals in private hospitals or practices in intensive care units in emergency departments in clinics or even in ambulances where available disinfecting us transducers is important because of the risks of cross infection from dirty probes which is mostly relevant when probes touch infectious material 5in the paediatric setting during the covid-19 pandemic it is important to operate with a plan designed not only to protect health care workers and thus ensure continuity of care but also to prevent transmission of infection among patients and their accompanying carers it is also important to use personal protective measures prudently so resources remain available for this reason there were discussions among radiologists trained nurses and infectious diseases specialists in two greek hospitals to formulate feasible protective measures for us in a general hospital with paediatric units and in a dedicated paediatric hospitalwe present our modified conditions of us service during the covid-19 pandemic we understand that epidemiology policies and health care conditions may vary from country to country and from hospital to hospital our modifications were based on the instructions of the national organization of public health in greece and considered protection of staff protection of the general population local settings and protection of resources we describe scenarios of us scanning not only for covid-19 patients but for all possible current settingsas of march 11 2020 containment measures to protect the general population in greece have been increasingly strict and follow the european centre for disease prevention and control social distancing measures 6these comprised closure of schools and universities closure of all stores except supermarkets and pharmacies no indoor gathering of people or outdoor activities with the exception of limited solitary exercise keeping distance 2 m from other citizens an intense stay at home campaign encouragement of work and education from home whenever possible and restrictions on transportation travellers from abroad were strictly introduced into a 14-day quarantine and expected to soon be denied entry into the country on march 23 people were told to stay home enforced lockdownregarding patient care outpatient appointments have been cancelled or postponed to reduce potential exposure to asymptomatic carriers as a result the number of us tests of outpatients has dramatically decreased to date the incidence of covid-19 in greece is less compared to other european countriesnational guidelines are written in greek and comprise among others general information recommendations on patient triage basic precautions risk assessment for health care workers and protection measures during manipulations around patients with suspected coronavirus infection 7 they are in line with the world health organization who and european centre for disease prevention and control guidelines 8 9 there are also detailed instructions about donning wearing personal protective equipment which includes mask glasses or goggles waterproof gowns long gloves and doffing undress in an ordered inside out technique to avoid dropletscontaminated material explicit instructions with photographs and sketches are mounted on the walls of all examination rooms in radiology departments 10 similar instructions in english are also available from european organizations 11 12 fig 1health care workers who provide care to covid-19 patients should be fully protected while those caring for non-covid-19 patients without respiratory symptoms should wear protective equipment according to standard precautions and risk assessment 8health care practitioners should also be aware of and apply the general preventive measures both during duty and in everyday life 7 8perform hand hygiene frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub if hands are not visibly dirty or with soap and water if hands are dirtyavoid touching eyes nose and mouthpractice respiratory hygiene by coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow or tissue and then immediately dispose the tissuewear a medical mask if you have respiratory symptoms and perform hand hygiene after disposing of the maskmaintain social distance suggestion of 12 m depending on the country from individuals with respiratory symptoms and socialize as little as possible 10 minbased on the mode of transmission of covid-19 a plan on a local level is mandatory 13 ideal personnel protection during us scanning would involve routine personal protection equipment for contact droplet and airborne transmission 8 however this is unrealistic and would cause an unnecessary and a potentially harmful waste of resources 8 12 considerations for a logical feasible plan are listed in table 1characteristics of our hospitals with emphasis on paediatric services available us machines and modifications for dedicated covid-19 areas and machine recruitment are summarized in table 2 locating all of the us machines in large hospitals can be challenging as they may be moved be uncatalogued or may be unknown to personnel 14 leaving us machines in designated covid-19 areas is a measure in line with efforts to move covid-19 patients inside the hospital as little as possible 7 us is not expected to be performed routinely in patients with covid-19 however it may be requested for emergencies hospitalized patients and selected outpatients who are all potential carriers to date the authors collective experience involves us in 27 suspected covid-19 patients 12 adults and 15 children of whom 3 all adults were eventually confirmed to have covid-19 it should be pointed out that one additional adult tested positive following the us scan and personnel were quarantined because they scanned the patient as per routine wearing only a surgical mask and gloves while the patient was not wearing any protection no us personnel have developed symptoms suggestive of covid-19triage of patients is essential 7 recognizing a symptomatic possible covid-19 patient before they enter the hospital ensures quarantine and the performance of necessary imaging tests under appropriate precautions 15 according to who and radiology expert panels trained personnel should ask about fever signssymptoms of respiratory tract infection or close contact with someone with confirmed or suspected covid-19 15 16 these inquiries are routinely asked at the entrances of both hospitals and also by radiology personnel fig 2 information either on the request formelectronic system or via phone about the child family and accompanying persons symptoms and epidemiological history provides an index of covid-19 likelihood before the patients arrival at the radiology department cancellation of us examinations that are not deemed urgent are considered on a case-by case basis and preferably following discussion with the referring physician however definitively excluding the disease cannot be achieved on the basis of history and clinical examination or even by a chest radiograph 17 this is why we apply protection measures during routine scanning and not exclusively for suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patientsstandard of practice in both hospitals has changed according to the probability of scanning a covid-19 patient we could identify three main scenarios a children and adults arriving at the emergency department with respiratory symptoms or a history of contact and also with suspected diagnoses that may require us for example febrile children with possible intussusception or appendicitis are scanned as covid-19 patients b likely not covid-19 children and adults referred for routine us scanning and c suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patients are hospitalized in a covid-19 ward or in a neonatal paediatric or intensive care unit requiring an us scan during hospitalization table 3 one should bear in mind that in highly endemic areas all patients could potentially be asymptomatic covid-19 carriers in the incubation period consequently modifications comprised the use of portable machines as much as possible use of protective equipment by patients and accompanying people use of protective equipment by personnel depending on the level of suspicion for covid-19 as prudently as possible the reduction of scan duration based on the choice of the more confidentexperienced operator the reduction of the number of individuals in the scanning room and a more meticulous selection of patients and disinfection procedures table 3 7 8 15 16 1820patients at the neonatal or paediatric intensive care units regardless of the probability of covid-19 are examined at bedside by regularly disinfected machines especially in the event of previous covid-19 patient scanning as per standard operation in these settings protection with a simple disposable gown hygiene of probes with soap water or nonalcoholic solution followed by hand hygiene use of mask and gloves and finally cleaning of used probes with disinfectant containing hydrogen peroxide ensures the protection of neonates and children from cross-contamination and are not meant to protect the radiologistssimilarly interventional procedures that are performed under us guidance including contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography cevus us-guided pneumatic or saline reduction of intussusception us-guided core needle biopsy and percutaneous drainage of various fluid collections are being performed with advanced measures of staff and patient protection probe protection with covering and subsequent disinfection due to the probes vicinity with body fluids and because they could be considered aerosol-generating procedures when children are not sedated these measures are routine in both suspectedconfirmed covid-19 children and elective outpatients due to the probability of infection by asymptomatic children as per local guidelinesthe routine use of a simple mask by patients who are asymptomatic is controversial in environments with restricted resources or low incidence for covid-19 such a measure is considered unnecessary for routine us scanning 21 however in centers with available recourses personal hand hygiene and a simple mask or facial coverage on patients especially on those with respiratory symptoms are strongly advised by local authorities 16 18 moreover correct application of a mask on a child for the duration of stay in the us suite is not always feasible we have been surprised by how well children can wear masks we have had children as young as 4 years old who tolerated the mask probably because everybody including their parents was wearing one as well in this context children ages 5 years or older may adhere while nontolerant children include mainly toddlers and uncooperative children of any agepersonal protective equipment accompanied by appropriate donning and doffing is an indispensable measure in confirmed covid-19 cases 8 the ultimate goal is to prevent infected hands from touching the face mouth nose and eye conjunctiva of us operators 17 instructions about personnel protection are continuously being revised depending on the area of the examination patient risk profile and nature of the personnel-patient contact 21 there is a consensus for protection with fitted respirator masks n95 respirators ffp2 or the equivalent eye goggles robe and appropriate shoes for aerosol-producing procedures like intubation suction turning the patient into a prone position etc in confirmed covid-19 patients 22 this is the best practice for us provided there is no shortage of respirator masks however in procedures that do not produce aerosol instructions vary and simple face masks instead of respirator masks are acceptable in the event of shortages 22in an attempt to save materials our staff dealing with non-covid-19 patients wear short-sleeved uniforms avoid touching the face with hands avoid close contact with the patient as much as possible reduce scanning time as much as possible to 14 min in the room per patient and perform personal hand hygiene from the elbows down regularly local guideline masks may remain on the examiners face for 2 h provided that they are not touched by bare hands or used gloves and they are not moved over or under the face this is in accordance with measures suggested in case of a shortage of materials 9 our teams decided to adopt these measures from the start to save protective equipment for confirmed hospitalized covid-19 cases and aerosol-generating procedures and we will potentially revise them depending on risk during the pandemic table 3 17us equipment is a possible transmitter of infectious diseases as shown in tests of probes used in emergency departments and intensive care units especially concerning interventional procedures or contact with body fluids 23 24 to date there is no consensus regarding best practice for probe disinfection even during routine us procedures 5 24 few facilities adhere to a regular disinfection plan 5 the virus sars-cov-2 is detectable in aerosols for up to 3 h and in other materials for 424 h depending on the composition of the material with simultaneous great reduction of virus titer 25 this stability likely contributes to transmission in health care settings 25 consequently probes in our hospitals are disinfected after each scan with an antiviral agent like sodium hypochlorite that is left on the probes until dry while soap is also an acceptable option in restricted resources 9 surface disinfection with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol significantly reduces coronavirus infectivity on surfaces within a minimum 1 min exposure time 26 the use of sheaths does not change the type of processing recommended for the transducer due to the potential for breakage of the probe covers and we consider them in confirmed covid-19 children especially in the event of an interventional procedure 26 the decontamination of the imaging room after caring for a suspected covid-19 patient includes a 1-h downtime for passive air exchange 15disinfecting portable machines can be the responsibility of the personnel who work in the room that hosts the machines andor the responsibility of the personnel who use the machines depending on local protocols staff availability and workload ideally a trained cleaning team is responsible for all machinery in dedicated covid-19 areas according to the local operation plan and a logbook that mentions the exact time and names of the personnel who performed each scan and disinfected the machine afterward ensures appropriate procedures we understand this may not be available in all hospitals and that trained personnel should disinfect machines and surfaces depending on local instructionswe have modified our us services following the probability of different covid-19 scenarios we hope that increased training of staff and regular simulations on the use of personal protective equipment and meticulous hand hygiene may prevent personnel infection and us-related patient contamination extra challenges for children include the necessity to triage parentsaccompanying people together with patients the appropriate application of hand hygiene and masks on symptomatic children triaged us machines in designated areas regular but selective personnel protective measures routine hand hygiene and the wiping and disinfection of probes and adjacent surfaces may prove to be successful protective measures in conclusion we tried to provide lines for action or confirmation of preparedness that readers may find relevant to their own health care systems 15on january 7 2020 china reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia associated with a novel pathogenic coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 this novel coronavirus was first identified in wuhan hubei province china on january 30 2020 the international health regulations emergency committee of the world health organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern since then on march 11 2020 the world health organization escalated the declaration to a pandemic currently this viral infection has spread to more than 180 countries with confirmed positive cases greater than 3 million people and associated deaths exceeding 210000 individuals the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was reported in the united states on january 20 20201 subsequently about 950000 patients have been confirmed to be infected and greater than 56000 patients have died with an ongoing and seriously concerning rapid increase in the number of patients and deaths associated with covid-19 many countries including the united states have now reported community spread of covid-19

the coronavirus family is a large family of single-stranded rna viruses that commonly cause infections in humans and other mammals such as bats cats cattle and camels the sars-cov2 virus that causes covid-19 is a -coronavirus with more than half of the sequence similar to previously known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov that caused epidemics in the last two decades we have a limited understanding of covid-19 infections based on the published literature and data from epidemics related to other similar viruses the majority of these infections present with influenza like symptoms with mild upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms with most cases including cough breathing difficulty fever headache altered sensation of smell or taste diarrhea vomiting body ache and rashes in some cases covid-19 can cause serious complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis multi-organ failure and death
the majority of the confirmed cases with covid-19 have been reported in adults especially older individuals with co-morbidities2 children have had relatively few infections reported in the literature to date2 3 4 5 6alt-text unlabelled box
the mode of transmission for covid-19 is known to be via exposure to respiratory droplets and fomites person-to-person transmission occurs during close exposure to a person infected with covid-19 or after contracting it from surfaces with secretions containing viable virus the role of small respirable particles aerosols or droplet nuclei to close proximity transmission is currently not clear airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely viral shedding has been noticed in the stool samples of infected patients7

8 however it is uncertain if covid-19 can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route currently there is no vaccine for covid-19 and multiple investigators across the globe are working towards creating an effective vaccine to prevent this infection9in the face of a growing pandemic with covid-19 there is an urgent need for proactive preparation and planning to combat covid-19 in the vulnerable patient population in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu and to safeguard patients their families and the healthcare personnel hcp taking care of them the aim of this article is to provide a roadmap to the various aspects of preparation needed to safely counter potential covid-19 infections in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu setting this guidance document is based on the centers for disease control and preventions cdc current recommendations for covid-19 and its adaptation to our local resourcesany person with suspected exposure or any symptoms consistent with covid-19 who is currently being investigated is placed under this categoryany procedure that may cause the release of aerosols in the environment puts the person performing them at a higher risk of exposure some of the examples include intubation extubation open airway suctioning nebulization cardiopulmonary resuscitation continuous positive airway pressure bag and mask ventilation and bronchoscopywe do not have sufficient information from the published literature regarding pregnancy outcomes birth defects and fetal loss in pregnant women with confirmed covid-19 infection there are limited case reports and retrospective reviews from china reporting premature births among mothers with covid-19 infection during pregnancy other viral respiratory infections in mothers during pregnancy may cause increased rates of congenital defects premature births and low birth weight among newborns ongoing monitoring for outcomes is important in order to learn more about the impact of covid-19 in both the short-term and the long-term period on the maternal and neonatal population
vertical transmission from pregnant women with covid-19 to fetuses during pregnancy or to newborns during and after delivery is not entirely understood but seems to be less likely based upon the currently available dataalt-text unlabelled box
in the limited data published in scientific reports outcomes among neonates born to mothers with confirmed covid-19 remain inconclusive but appear to indicate a lack of in-utero infection or vertical transmission10

11 a case series published by chen et al for nine mothers with covid-19 pneumonia all of whom had a cesarean section and had healthy newborns10 appears to confirm this four of the nine infants were born late preterm at 36 weeks and one was born early term at 37 weeks gestational age six mother-newborn dyads were tested for sars-cov-2 in the amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breast milk samples and all samples tested negative for the viruszeng et al studied 33 neonates born at wuhan childrens hospital in wuhan hubei province china to mothers with confirmed covid-19 three neonates among 33 were found to be positive for covid-19 all delivered by cesarean section12 two were born at 40 weeks gestation and developed a fever the third neonate was born prematurely at 31 weeks gestation due to fetal distress this study presented limited information regarding a detailed timing of separation of the newborns from the mother and other family members with covid-19 who may have been in close contact with the newborns after delivery there was also insufficient information on the method of feeding for the neonates all of which makes it difficult to determine if the infection among these newborns was vertically or horizontally transmitted in a case series by zhu et al outcomes of 10 neonates including two pairs of twins born to mothers with covid-19 were reported13 one neonate died six were born premature 31 to 34 weeks gestational age and two were small for their gestational age none of the newborns that got tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for sars-cov-2 were confirmed positive but the authors reported fetal distress respiratory distress fever thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver function tests in some of these newborns despite testing negative for covid-19researchers from china tested antibodies igg and igm for sars-cov-2 in a small case series involving six neonates born to mothers with covid-19 using a negative real time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test from throat swabs and blood samples they observed virus specific antibodies detected in the serum of all six newborns despite no physical contact with the mother after delivery14 two infants had igg and igm levels higher than the normal level 10 auml and inflammatory cytokine il-6 was significantly increased in all infants none of the infants presented with any symptoms as of march 8 2020 in their editorial comment regarding this case series as well another case report published on the same day14

15 kimberlin et al expressed caution in interpreting the results from these reports16 igm antibodies have a large polymeric structure and thus do not cross the placenta when igm antibodies are found in a newborn they may reflect fetal production following in-utero infection igm enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for congenital infections has a lower sensitivity  specificity than molecular diagnostic tests based on nucleic acid amplification and detection and may have higher false-positive or false-negative results one of the case reports described a very rapid decline in the level of igm antibodies in these newborns15 which is very unusual for igm levels in other congenitally acquired infections in which they typically last for a few months given this information it remains unclear if these reports represented a true congenital infection or just an artifact of resulting antibody levelsas the majority of currently reported covid-19 infections in pregnant mothers occurred during their third trimester it would be prudent to closely follow infants born to the mothers who tested positive during their first and second trimester since it is a novel infection just recently identified in humans there is no information on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes amongst infants born to mothers with confirmed covid-19 infection during pregnancy as well as for infants who get infected themselvesthe following are our recommendations to allow for optimal safety for mothers their infants family members and hcppreparation starts with identifying one of two possible scenarios a mother with confirmed infection with covid-19 or a mother with a suspected infection or a pui the obstetrics team should have guidelines in place for both triage and delivery of the fetus infectious disease id and infection prevention and control ipc teams should be consulted for any suspected or confirmed cases this should be clearly documented in the medical record and communicated to other teams taking care of these mothers in conjunction with the primary obstetrics team including neonatology obstetric teams should have a low threshold for testing of covid-19 infections in mothers with a new onset of symptoms including fever which otherwise would have been worked up for chorioamnionitis as well as for any other upper respiratory symptom at some institutions with widespread community transmission all mothers admitted to the labor and delivery ward are tested for sars-cov-2 which may be helpful in identifying asymptomatic patients this may not be possible at all institutes as it requires resources for a lot of testing with rapid turnaround timesdeliveries at-risk for super spreading events or with uncertain progressive clinical courses should be done in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room aiir with airborne contact eye-shield precautions n95 or higher respirator with eye shield or powered air-purifying respirator gown gloves mothers with suspected or confirmed infection with a stable course and unlikely to require super spreading events could alternatively stay in a neutral pressure room with droplet contact eye-shield precautions surgical mask n95 or higher respiratory preferred eye shield gown glovesteam members who would attend high-risk deliveries should be identified at the beginning of the shift in order to maintain compliance with neonatal resuscitation program guidelines while ensuring only key personnel are entering the delivery room having a fully prepared back-up team outside the delivery room which enters the room on an as needed basis only could be beneficial to limit exposure
a pre-delivery multidisciplinary team huddle with an optimal dissemination of medical history estimated infant weight and clear roles assigned to individual nicu team members especially for full neonatal codes can be extremely helpfulalt-text unlabelled box
a clear method of communication between team members inside and outside the delivery room should be established ensuring adequate supply of appropriate personal protective equipment ppe and identifying a clear location where to procure them ideally immediately outside and within identified labor and delivery rooms or the operative room is also valuable based on our experience we have developed a delivery preparation checklist that we have found to be useful and that can be modified for use by other institutions table 1
all hcp must enter the delivery room with appropriate ppe and follow recommended infection control practices based on the maternal covid-19 status and the risk factors for super spreading events infant bag-valve mask set-up should include a hepa filter to minimize aerosols produced during positive pressure ventilation as mentioned previously having an identified team available for high and low risk deliveries with back up team members outside the room may provide sufficient coverage if help is needed for the mother or infant some team members could help in other tasks such as a runner to the lab blood bank nurses and pharmacists helping with the preparation of medications after routine care or the need for resuscitation the family should be updated there should be a process outlined for cleaning the room and equipment before and after use by a suspected or confirmed covid-19 patient a detailed debriefing should be done after delivery and the safe disposition of the infant in order to review how things went and identify areas of improvement mock drills and simulation exercises with multidisciplinary teams to evaluate readiness and identify gaps as well as learning opportunities should be consideredthere are multiple scenarios that may require the transport of a newborn within a facility such as transfer from the delivery room to a newborn nursery or to the nicu for investigations eg magnetic resonance imaging to the operating room and to the mothers postpartum room infants should be isolated and separated after delivery from mothers who are suspected or confirmed with covid-19 in order to avoid exposure based upon the medical needs neonates could be transferred to the newborn nursery or to the nicu there should be clear communication between the delivery team designated elevator services if needed and the recipient unit or area regarding transfer of an infant ppe such as gloves and gowns should be changed before transporting the infant but masks can continue to be worn if not soiled or wet there should be a dedicated transport isolette that is cleaned appropriately before and after use as per hospital disinfection guidelinesmany sick newborns requiring a higher level of care are transferred to regional perinatal centers it is helpful to engage in preemptive planning such as using a checklist to prepare for transfer of a neonate born to a pui or covid-19 positive mother clear communication between the referring and accepting teams should take place including the condition of the patient and symptom history of the mother andor family members who may have close contact if unsure of the status of the patient with regards to covid-19 a discussion of the case with the pediatric id and ipc teams should take place as soon as the call for a transfer request is received in order to help in ensuring the correct designation of the newborn all members of the transport team including the driver should use appropriate ppe while transporting the infant before leaving the patients room isolation gowns and gloves should be changed but masks may continue to be worn if not soiled or wet as discussed earlierthese infants should be designated as a pui they should be temporarily separated from their mothers and placed in a separate isolation room in the interest of patients and their families this is an unfortunate but necessary undertaking there should be a clear dialogue and shared decision making between clinicians and families and the need for such intervention should be explained preferably before delivery all efforts should be made to provide support to the mother while she is separated from her newborn clinicians should document any refusal to follow recommendations of isolation and document any discussion regarding the risks of infection that could result from failure to isolate the newborn from the mother after birth infants not requiring intensive care may be admitted to the mother baby unit but remain separated as mentioned earlier these rooms should have negative pressure with clear signage outside the room and all hcp should take appropriate precautions and use ppe while taking care of these newborn infants although aiir are preferred neutral pressure rooms could be considered based on the clinical status of the mother and the infant newborns should be bathed as soon as possible to remove potential virus contained in secretions that may remain on the skin there should be a limit to the number of visitors allowed with a process in place for screening symptoms at every visit for source containment mothers should wear a mask whenever the neonate is in the roomif due to a limitation of a facilitys resources or due to the mothers wishes a newborn is rooming-in with the mother there should be a physical barrier such as a curtain with a minimum of six feet distance between both patients the mother or other caregiver should put on a mask and follow strict hand hygiene before and after feeding and when they have any close contact with the newborn breastfeeding and handling of breast milk is discussed in the later sectionsat our institution infants are tested for sars-cov-2 at 24 hours of life with a second test completed at minimum 24 hours apart or at discharge for a well newborn for patients in the nicu a second test is done five days after the first test or earlier on discretion of clinical teams if both tests are negative and the patient is doing clinically well the infant can be discharged home medical management of a neonate with covid-19 is beyond the scope of this article and should be done in consultation with the infants primary medical team and id teamsneonates born to mothers with a suspected pui or a confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 are placed in a separate aiir stable neonates with respiratory support up to 2 litres minute by nasal cannula can be placed in a neutral pressure room with droplet  contact  eye-shield precautions and a hepa filter infants on respiratory support greater than 2 litres minute nasal cannula or those that may require an aerosol generating procedure should be placed in an aiir with airborne contact eye-shield precautions there should be clear signage outside the room regarding infection prevention precautions needed before entering all hcp who enter the room of a patient with known or suspected covid-19 should adhere to aforementioned infection prevention precautions and implementing staffing policies to minimize the number of hcp who enter the room is suggested only essential personnel should enter the room for example physical exams should be limited to the attending physician facilities should consider dedicating specific hcp to care for these patients in order to minimize the risk of transmission and exposure to other patients and other hcp ideally all suspected patients would be placed in a separate room if there is more than one patient covid-19-suspected or positive patients could be cohorted together with patients of similar status based on availability of local resources and spacea log of every hcp entering and exiting the patients room should be kept in addition dedicated or disposable non-critical patient-care equipment such as blood pressure cuffs should be used all pui or positive infants should have a bag-valve mask with a hepa filter at the bedside to reduce the risk of aerosol spread if the infant requires positive pressure ventilation if equipment will be used for more than one patient cleaning and disinfection between uses should be carried out according to the manufacturers instructions similarly environmental surfaces and the room should be properly cleaned before and after use medical waste should be carefully disposed of in the same way as infectious medical waste17 every health facility should assess their own bed surge-capacity and available resources in order to develop a plan for the placement of a newborn and to adopt a locally suited approach consistent with the recommendations from the cdc see table 2
for our adaptation of cdc recommendationsso far there are only rare case reports of newborns with covid-19 sars-cov-2 attaches to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 receptors to enter cells there is a concern that due to the presence of ace2 receptor on neurons there could be a pertussis-like respiratory center suppression in neonates if they get infected with covid-19 therefore all neonates with any degree of illness who are born to mothers with covid-19 should be observed until their illness is resolved if there is a new confirmed covid-19 infection in a neonate the same guidelines should be adopted for care of a neonate by hcp and family based upon respiratory status and likelihood of infection in a newborn although currently inconclusive the majority of neonatal infections seem to follow horizontal transmission rather than vertical
breast milk is not contra-indicated for newborns with maternal pui or confirmed covid-19 infectionsit is critical to follow adequate infection prevention measures for collecting expressed breast milk in the limited available literature covid-19 has not been detected in breast milk10 and per current cdc guidelines expressed breast milk is encouraged mothers should be encouraged to express their breast milk to establish and maintain milk supplyalt-text unlabelled box
a dedicated breast pump should be given to mothers as a well as a mask to wear while pumping18 mothers should use strict hand hygiene before during and after a pumping session all parts of a breast pump should be thoroughly washed and sanitized as per the manufacturers instructions in conjunction with cdc guidelines19 an alternative caregiver or nurse can feed expressed breast milk to the infant to support breast milk feeding in infants who remain admitted to the nicu after their mothers have been discharged facilities should devise a plan to allow for breast milk drop-off from an asymptomatic partner or caregivermothers can start direct breastfeeding when they have been afebrile for a minimum of 72 hours without the use of antipyretics and the majority of their respiratory symptoms are resolved they should be instructed to wear a mask and to practice strict hand hygiene as well as the thorough cleaning of the breast before and after breastfeeding if the mother cannot provide breast milk and there is an option for donor breast milk at the facility this could be offered all accepted donor milk is pasteurized and this heat-treatment kills both bacteria and viruses feeding options and the clinical plan for an infant should be discussed with the mother ideally before deliveryalthough mothers are encouraged to use the strict infection prevention measures care and consideration to prevent covid-19 through direct contact with breast milk containers should be considered with community spread and the potential for many asymptomatic carriers of covid-19 a cleaning process should be in place when receiving breast milk from all mothers during the covid-19 pandemic every breast milk container received from a pui or covid-19 positive mother should be considered as a potential vector as a result each container should be cleaned with a disinfectant wipe and placed in a new clean plastic bagas information continues to be fluid during the covid-19 pandemic and recommendations may frequently change it can be difficult for the multidisciplinary team to continuously track and follow evolving recommendations therefore clear pathways of communication are needed to update hcp in order to provide care to mothers and infants as well as to allow hcp to educate families on the most up to date information there should be a pre-defined electronic or physical space where the latest information could be obtained by any hcp if needed some of the ways to successfully keep team members up to date may include twice daily multidisciplinary huddles daily rounding by a multidisciplinary leadership team and a synthesis document of key practice changes with links to pertinent policies education documents for families to take home should also be created and frequently updated with recommendations to allow for standardized teaching to the families another important staff education initiative includes information around ppe all hcp should receive training regarding the correct use proper donning doffing and disposal of any ppe additionally the use of safety monitors in the units which perform live observational audits and coaching allows for real time corrections and prevention of ppe breacheswhile a neonate born to a mother with a confirmed diagnosis or pui is admitted to the nicu all medical information should be regularly provided to the mother and other designated family members for medical and general updates use of video-based methods to communicate with parents would be a good alternative if available for updates requiring in-person conversations all arrangements should be made to ensure that there is a limited number of staff and family members present in the room with implementation of complete ppe precautions and adequate safe distancing between individuals to avoid the spread of infection a possible or confirmed infection in a neonate would cause psychological stress to the family17 support should be provided to them by involving social workers psychologists and palliative care teamsdue to the current covid-19 pandemic visitation to our nicu has been restricted to a maximum of two people only parents or two people as per individual family situation with only one person at a time is allowed at the bedside a similar restricted visitors policy was employed at our unit during the recent measles outbreak in the new york city metropolitan area a medical history of any sickness fever and of any upper respiratory symptoms is taken from all caregivers before entering the hospital in order to ensure that only healthy caregivers can visit the patient visitors should be asymptomatic and wear a mask while visiting the nicu or well-baby nursery family care partners or parents who are allowed to visit should strictly follow the infection control guidelines and use appropriate ppe while providing care to the newborn mothers with covid-19 should not visit the nicu until they are afebrile without the use of antipyretics for at least 72 hours with improvement of respiratory symptoms and two negative rt-pcr tests for sars-cov-2if the mother remains afebrile for greater than 24 hours and respiratory symptoms have nearly resolved consider discharge of the medically stable newborn with the mother if the mother is still febrile or has significant respiratory symptoms a caregiver who does not have symptoms can care for the infant if the infant will be discharged to a home where there is a pui or covid-19 positive mother or partner it is highly recommended that the infected person should not care for the infant unless there is no alternative a covid-19 positive mother or partner should wear a mask perform strict hand hygiene and keep a distance of at least 6 feet from the newborn until they are afebrile for 72 hours with near resolution of respiratory symptoms and 7 days have passed since the beginning of the symptoms or two rt-pcr tests for sars-cov-2 done a minimum of 24 hours apart have been negative facilities should develop a process to safely identify and discharge an infant to an alternative caregiver if the mother or partner is unable to care for the infant at the time of discharge discharge instructions should be given in the mothers room or via video phone conferencing if needed infants will be transported to the mothers room or to the family at the hospital lobby for discharge parents caregivers and other family members should engage in the usual preventive steps to avoid the spread of respiratory infection specifically practicing hand hygiene covering coughs and staying up to date on vaccinations including influenza the medical team should call the newborns outpatient pediatric practice to confirm that the office is able to see the newborn if unable to see the newborn an alternative practice should be selected it is important to emphasize that it is unusual for infants to have respiratory symptoms within the first few days of life and hcp should have a low threshold for considering covid-19 on the differential even if the initial test in the newborn may be negativethere is a widespread concern regarding the national shortage of ppe and hence limited supply to hospitals in particular many n95 masks are made in or their raw material for production is obtained primarily from hubei province in china which was the first epicenter for this outbreak therefore there was a backlog of ppe reported by multiple institutions critical supplies including identifying alternative products for ppe should be continuously assessed there should be an institution-based plan to conserve and develop re-use protocols for critical supplies including n95 respirators and surgical masks in order to prepare for extended supply chain disruptions transparency to the staff and actions to allow for the hcp team to feel confident and safe while caring for patients is of the utmost importanceat our institutions guidelines have been implemented for the use of n95 respirators by hcp when caring for a patient on airborne and airborne-combination precautions our institutions developed indications for the safe use and re-use of n95 respirators if it has a tight fit but not restricting breathing and is not wet damaged or contaminated n95 respirators can be safely stored in a clean paper bag between uses during a shiftin a scenario of widespread covid-19 in a community there may be an increase in admissions to the nicu as well as a shortage of staff and hospital beds there needs to be a local institutional plan in place for such situations so patients can be cared for safely and transferred out if needed with prior preparation for safe transports due to significant usage of oxygen while caring for patients with covid-19 throughout the hospital a back up system to ensure continuous oxygen supply should be devised our institution has established staffing and employee wellness task forces to identify external clinical resources and support our staff who may be asked to care for covid-19 patients there are daily multidisciplinary leadership and management calls to set an operational tempo assess preparedness and prioritize enterprise-wide action we developed a plan for our nicu regarding census and staffing involving clear directions for patient care and when to initiate transferring patients out if needed there should also be a plan for cohorting of suspected or confirmed cases of covid-19 in the nicu and well-baby nursery if space becomes an issue medical service providers will also be under tremendous psychological pressure due to overwork shortage of medical resources patients poor outcomes infection among their colleagues or other detrimental experiences
medical staff should be provided with adequate psychological support as their physical and mental health is crucial in the context of a pandemicalt-text unlabelled box
we share this guidance for the preparation of the nicu at a regional perinatal center during the global novel covid-19 pandemic children seem to be less affected with this infection based on the limited published literature however one of the most vulnerable pediatric patient populations is cared for in nicus current data on the effects of covid-19 in fetal life and among neonates after birth is uncertain as such there is a need for proactive preparation and planning to manage these viral infections in neonates in ways that safeguard the patients their families and the healthcare personnel providing their care our understanding of covid-19 is still evolving therefore we strongly suggest continuously monitoring the latest updates from cdc and local health authorities every health care facility should evaluate their available resources and make locally suited guidelines to take care of newborns with suspected or confirmed covid-19 consistent with recommendations from cdcprotocols and plans for emergency surgeries should be done in a hospital assigned for patients with sars-cov-2 selected surgeries should be postponed in principle the decision of whether limited surgeries should be performed requires multidisciplinary team consultation patients suspected of sars-cov-2 are treated the same way as those diagnosed with sars-cov-24 anesthesiologists need to get information from medical record and talk with supervising physician and the parents the key points that need to be known are the symptoms such as fever 373 cough sore throat and the chest ct scan which should be confirmed by anesthesiologist and surgeon5 andor positive test to sars-cov-2 by real-time pcrthe pediatric patient is prone to be anxious when separated from parents which leads to saliva spraying with sars-cov-2 midazolam or dexmedetomidine should be given before the patient enters the operating room or from his parents surgical mask should be put on all the waynegative-pressure below 5 pa or with separate entrance and exit should be ready for the surgeries laminar flow and clean air conditioning in the or should be shut off if there is no negative-pressure or air circulation system with virus inactive should be installed temporarily if possible materials and machines should be ready enough according to the type of surgery other irrelevant appliance should be removed out of or an obvious signboard of isolated surgery should be hung outside the door experienced anesthesiologists and nurses should be assigned to manage the surgery as few doctors and nurses should be required as possible two anesthesiologists should be involved one attending and one resident everyone who enters the or should receive strict training for putting on or off protective clothing one would not be permitted to manage the patient unless heshe put on the clothes with tertiary prevention correctly according to technical guideline for prevention and control of novel coronavirus infections at medical institutions6 and gets the permission from the prevention supervisordisposable supplies are the best choice three filters are recommended one is filter with heat and moisture exchanger at the top of endotracheal tube the other two are filters placed on the both sides of the breathing loop inlet and outlet respectively two anesthesiologists and three nurses are involved circulating nurse transports the patient to negative-pressure or with the help of a resident optimal transport bed is the one with increased crew protection along the assigned private route disposable surgical blanket is the substitute when increased crew protection is not acquired a surgical frame should be put above the head to keep the airway open patient would be reassessed by the attending nurse after entering the or instrument nurse and first circulating nurse should be present inside the or the second circulating nurse is responsible for delivery at the buffer room the second circulating nurse should get dressed with secondary containment participants for transportation should put on the clothes with tertiary preventionsymptoms of most children and infants with sars-cov-2 are mild such as fever and cough4 proper anesthesia plan should be given with personalized precision medicine to every infant the general principle is the adequate oxygen supply optimal anesthesia medicine with minimum side effect avoiding cough reflex and agitation and ensuring the safety of both patient and staff5 6
in order to avoid droplet and possible aerosol pollution from patients respiratory tract caused by unanticipated crying intravenous sedatives or mask-inhaled sevoflurane should be used for induction as for the american society of anesthesiologists asa class iii patients with stable cardiopulmonary function on the basis of satisfying surgical operation it is recommended to apply intravenous anesthesia without intubation combined with regional nerve block or caudal block anesthesia excluding stomach satiation brain surgery craniofacial ear-nose-throat ent surgery cardiothoracic and laparoscopic surgery maintain patients spontaneous breathing and oxygen inhalation by continuous positive airway pressure cpap with an airtight mask then keep monitoring and prepare for intubation as soon as possible as recommended patients with a preoperative asa class iii and above or in severe cases are anesthetized with tracheal intubation intravenous and inhalational technique combined with general anesthesia low flow closed air is required lung-protective ventilation should have lower tidal volume 38 mlkg and limited plateau pressure below 30 cm h2o7 intubation should be performed by an experienced anesthesiologist to ensure first-time success of intubation in cases of difficult airway the laryngeal mask should be placed after first failure for intubation to avoid the risk of infection caused by repeated attempts of intubation8 proper removal of protective equipment is recommended under the guidance of infection control protection supervision protective clothing should be discarded in a double-folded yellow medical garbage bag and wrapped in designated areathe key points of protection during endotracheal intubation are to prevent patients from coughing during the operation and to prevent the discharge of patient secretions the following necessary notes should be taken into consideration 1 o

udgment of catheter depth the distance scale of the tube to the incisor the degree of bilateral thorax undulation the co2 waveform of the ventilators expiration and the breathing parameters for comprehensive judgment should be observed it is not easy to judge the depth of the catheter by auscultation of breathing sounds 5 for patients with oral secretions if without airway obstruction it is recommended to perform airway aspiration after completing the tracheal intubation disable central suction enable electric suction device use closed suction system for tracheal suction to prevent secretion pollutionproposed medicine for anesthesia management is propofol remifentanil pump or sevoflrurane inhalation and rocuronium intermittent bolus keep intensive intraoperative monitor monitor invasive blood pressure and central venous pressure if necessary for hemodynamic stability critically ill children might have pathological conditions such as acute lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome heart failure acid-base imbalance and electrolyte disorders in which case more attention and close monitoring is needed9
patient with cpap is observed for 510 min in or and then transported to the isolated ward postoperatively those with intubation need to be reassessed after surgery if children with mild diseases and stabilized condition are under monitoring extubation could be carried out after tracheal suction under deep sedation before extubation an appropriate amount of lidocaine is injected intravenously and mouth and nose are covered with two pieces of warm and moist gauze to avoid the discharge of secretions caused by choking indications for extubation are regular spontaneous respiration tidal volume over 6 mlkg and end-expiratory carbon dioxide partial pressure petco2 below 50 mm hg antagonists are not recommended for the patient appropriate postoperative analgesia can reduce crying or agitation after extubation patient could be sent to the isolation ward directly after extubation if the steward score is 5to avoid children waking up or moving during transport it is recommended to deepen the anesthesia or to give additional muscle relaxant before the severe children leave the or the patient is transferred to the isolation ward directly after exbutation care should be provided to enhance respiratory support and organ functional support in time and prevent secondary infections extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo should be supported if necessary2 10
patient should be transported back to the ward with the same bed and the same route before surgery staff involved in transport should put on the new clothes with tertiary preventionall medical waste should be discarded into double-folded yellow medical garbage bag or buckets in strict accordance with relative rules and made sure that novel coronavirus infection logo is specifically markedanesthesia machines should be routinely disinfected with anesthesia sterilizer video laryngoscopes anesthesia carts and other anesthesia facilities should also be wiped and disinfected with hydrogen peroxide disinfection wipes the infection control team should check and record the disinfection for trace-back investigationsproper removal of protective equipment is recommended under the guidance of the infection control and protection supervisor protective clothing should be discarded in a double-folded yellow medical garbage bag and wrapped in designated areaall healthcare staffs are vulnerable to infection patients blood body fluids secretions and discharge are all contagious which must be isolated anesthesiologists must prevent blood and non-blood infections from being transmitted during the operation anesthesiologists should try to keep a certain distance from the operating bed to prevent blood contamination of children on the bed the sharp instruments in or should be carefully recovered and treated to prevent stab wounds and the iatrogenic occupational exposure iatrogenic occupational exposure treatment should be started immediately once it happened11 furthermore much attention should be paid to tracking and management after contacting with suspected or confirmed cases after exposed to those suspected of or confirmed with to sars-cov-2 ones complete blood count c reactive protein and pulmonary imaging should be evaluated individually if symptoms such as fever cough or fatigue occurr each case should be reported to the department and isolated from the outside specially trained staff should be set up in each department for recording and keeping trace of the suspected cases in order to take following measures postoperative infectious prevention should be performed in accordance with the relevant regulations of the hospital air purification management regulations and medical institution disinfection technical specificationsowing to special physiological and pathophysiological characters of children especially infants and young children it is necessary for medical staff to follow the requirements strictly for the protection from novel coronavirus infections in airway management and perioperative anesthesia management in order to avoid passive infection during airway management and other contacting operations appropriate anesthetic technique provides adequate oxygen and the best role in protecting the organ functions which contribute to the pediatric treatment and disease control of epidemic situations of novel coronavirus infectioncoronaviruses are spherically enveloped rna viruses that have club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface giving them the appearance of a solar corona2 before the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 these were primarily thought to be mild seasonal pathogens3 the virus causing the covid-19 pandemic is sars-cov-24 which has 79 homology with sars-cov and a similar receptor-binding domain5 the particle core diameter is 82 to 94 nm and spikes extend another 19 nm giving a total average size of 101 to 113 nm 01 m3 spikes are essential for infectivity6 which is thought to be via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor expressed in type ii alveolar cells57 during initial infection there are also high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract8 transmission is believed to be predominantly via inhalation of droplets the distinction between droplet 10100 m and aerosol 10 m is based on diameter of the respiratory particles leading to transmission fig 19 droplet transmission occurs during an expiratory event breathing talking coughing sneezing that deposits droplets onto a susceptible persons mucous membranes because these gravitationally settle quickly transmission is only through close contact by comparison aerosol transmission is through smaller respiratory droplets that can remain airborne10 although many respiratory pathogens can behave as airborne in a favorable environment relatively few notably tuberculosis measles and varicella are thought to have the potential to be transmitted by the long-range airborne route9 data related to transmission for covid-19 is largely inferred from data related to sars-cov11 some reports also show aerosol transmission of sars-cov1213 air samples from covid-19 patients rooms have however been very low or negative for virus therefore supporting the idea of droplet-only transmission1416 during normal breathing the falling distance of droplets is 2 cm but coughing and sneezing produce larger and higher velocity droplets1718 a 30 m droplet produced during a cough travels up to 25 m from the subject18 certain patient procedures are also considered to aerosolize respiratory secretions including endotracheal intubation cardiopulmonary resuscitation bronchoscopy open suction of the respiratory tract sputum induction use of nebulizer therapy noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and high frequency oscillatory ventilation1619 this is particularly relevant to surgical populations as nearly all of these procedures can be a part of standard perioperative care
as data are forthcoming on the asymptomatic spread of this virus each infected person on average can spread to another 22 people and an epidemic will increase as long as this value is 1 person20 therefore the goal of ppe is to protect the individual and limit this spread in the asymptomatic healthcare worker to their colleagues and respective patients who are disease freea recent report by the chinese center for disease control and prevention showed that only 38 of all cases were healthcare personnel although 15 were classified as severe or critical there was a 02 mortality rate21 earlier in the pandemic infection of healthcare workers was as high as 2921 and this dramatically decreased thereafter this decrease in infection rate is likely a reflection of the ppe measures put in place to appropriately protect healthcare workerson january 23 2020 dr wang guangfa of peking university first hospital reported that he had covid-19 and believed it was transmitted through his conjunctiva because he wore an n95 mask37 there is evidence that ace2 receptors are present in the aqueous humor of the eye38 but conjunctivitis has not been described in patients with covid-193940 and no virus was identified on the conjunctival swabs of 114 patients with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia24 laboratory studies also show that influenza can enter the nasopharynx with only ocular exposure22 but rates of transmission of influenza are unchanged by wearing goggles22 another study however showed that uninfected sars-cov healthcare workers were more likely to use goggles23 thus at this time there is limited data that transmission of covid-19 can occur through the mucous membranes of the eyes or that eye protection beyond what is already routine is helpful in preventing transmission nevertheless eye protection is recommended when caring for a patient with known or suspected covid-19 infection by the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc19 in korea in a number of different patient care situations41 and in hong kong for high-risk patient interactions16because covid-19 is thought to spread via droplets less data regarding the transmission of covid-19 are focused on gowns and gloves which are the ppe components of contact precautions handwashing has been unequivocally recognized as an essential measure to slow contact transmission its frequent practice is less reliant on new or additional healthcare resources and therefore will not be discussed in further detail here gowns are rated by american national standards instituteassociation for the advancement of medical instrumentation pb702012 standards level 1 to 4 with level 4 having the greatest protection against viruses42 during the sars epidemic 2 studies found that uninfected healthcare workers in hong kong more often wore gowns as a part of their ppe when compared to infected healthcare workers1123 one of these studies also reported a significant difference for wearing gloves22 both reported uninfected healthcare workers were more likely to wear all recommended ppe1123 it should be noted that in a laboratory environment aerosolized sars-cov-2 has a median half-life of 56 hours on stainless steel and 68 hours on plastic25 and has also been detected on surfaces in patient rooms16 therefore the use of gown and gloves may help prevent transmission from fomites to the healthcare workers mucous membranes the cdc recommends both gowns and gloves when caring for a patient with known or suspected covid-1919 full body protective suits have been used in other viral epidemics that are bloodborne and spread primarily by contact eg ebola virus43 but the authors found no data regarding their use for sars-cov or covid-19in the united states surgical masks are rated by astm astm international f2100-19 as level 1 2 or 3 based on their permeability to synthetic blood bacteria staphylococcus aureus particles latex spheres and flammability level 1 masks must have 95 filtration efficiency to bacteria and air particles 01 to 50 m for levels 2 and 3 this increases to 98 level 3 surgical masks do not have additional filtration efficiency but do have greater resistance to synthetic blood very few reports or guidelines distinguish between the different types of surgical masks though furthermore these ratings apply to the materials used in manufacturing because surgical masks fit loosely they cannot reliably prevent inhalation of all airborne particles26 but they do help to a degree one study found that a level 1 mask reduced passage of 002 to 1 m particles 27-fold44surgical masks appear to be helpful in decreasing the transmission of influenza sars-cov and covid-19 two randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare surgical masks level 326 or unspecified27 to n95 masks regarding transmission of influenza to healthcare workers the results showed no difference in the influenza infection rates between the surgical mask and n95 groups2627 another study by yen et al28 compared hospitals with and without sars-cov healthcare worker infections these authors found that zero healthcare worker infections were more likely in hospitals where surgical masks were worn upon entering the hospital on the wards and in outpatient clinics28 this is the same plan of action currently being used in hong kong singapore and taiwan164546 a recent study from singapore of 41 healthcare workers in close contact 10 min 2 m away with a critically ill covid-19 patient showed zero transmissions47 of these healthcare workers 35 of 41 85 were using a surgical mask for respiratory protection47 thus since surgical face masks filter particles larger than 01 to 50 m and the droplets that carry sars-cov-2 are larger it stands to reason that there should be adequate protection from transmission of covid-19 in low risk circumstances these findings have led many institutions to promote use of surgical face masks in lower risk patient interactions and advocate for the futility of n95 respirator masks especially during times of scarcity it should be noted however that the cdc recommends use of a surgical face mask if a respirator is not available when caring for a patient with known or suspected covid-1919ffrs are ppe designed to protect against respirable particulate matter irrespective of whether they are inert or biologic particles the most commonly used ffr do not require electricity nonpowered and function simply as a mask they are classified by the percentage of challenge particles 03 m filtered out during testing 95 99 999 and by the type of particles filtered out r rated ffr are somewhat resistant to oil p rated ffr are more strongly resistant to oil whereas n rated ffr are not resistant to oil ffrs have an assigned protection factor apf of 10 meaning they can reduce aerosol concentration to one tenth of the ambient air ie blocking 90 of airborne particles they must meet certification tests established by national institute of occupational safety and health however the fda does not perform independent testing of any ffr other than surgical n95 masks48 surgical n95 masks are constructed to prevent contamination of the sterile field while providing the same protection of conventional n95s the fda publishes certified vendors of surgical n95s as a resource for individuals and for purchasing institutions49 the different types of ffrs are presented in table 2ffrs have been tested against ultrafine viral particles 00205 m50 results varied slightly by the type of viral particle but with airflow rates for nonstrenuous breathing n95 penetration was 023 to 168 and n99 penetration was 096 to 103 of note viral penetration did increase with moderate airflow simulating strenuous breathing up to approximately 5 for n99 and n95 ffrs49 another study compared viral penetration of n95 masks to surgical masks and showed that while n95 penetration was 5 level 2 surgical mask penetration was 21 and level 1 surgical mask penetration was 85 for moderate airflow30 the extrapolation of these data to infection by droplet transmission may be flawed however due to the larger size of the droplets 10100 m that carry sars-cov-2 viral particles in a nonexperimental setting an example of this is the similar transmission rates of influenza to healthcare workers using n95 or surgical masks described above2627there are several studies that examine n95 use as it relates to transmission of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 as mentioned above yen et al28 compared hospitals with and without infected healthcare workers during the sars-cov epidemic in taiwan and found that 100 of hospitals with zero sars-cov healthcare worker infections used n95 masks in zones of risk28 a case-matched study of healthcare workers infected with sars-cov compared their ppe use to healthcare workers who were not infected23 nearly 100 of the participants used either a surgical mask or an n95 mask and there was no difference in the type of mask used when comparing infected and noninfected healthcare workers23 a study specifically examining critical care nurses also found no differences in the rates of becoming infected when using a surgical mask compared to an n95 mask29 wang et al31 published healthcare worker infection rates from wuhan university from december 2019 and showed that none of the 278 staff members who wore n95 masks became infected doctors and nurses on surgical floors who did not interact with covid-19 patients were considered low risk and did not wear masks and 10 of 215 46 of these individuals ultimately became infected31 currently the cdc recommends use of an n95 mask when caring for a patient with known or suspected covid-19 if available and recommends an n95 or higher respirator when performing or present for aerosol-generating procedures19 in korea n95 masks at minimum have been recommended for all hospital interactions except disposal of medical waste23 in hong kong they are recommended for staff working in triage with confirmed covid-19 cases and when performing aerosol generating procedures16because of the covid-19 pandemic resource scarcity has raised the prospect of reuse of ffrs extended single use of ffr is favored over limited reuse because of the risk of self-inoculation31 for extended single use this is most practical when patients are cohorted patients with a common diagnosis in the same unit51 it has been shown that donning an ffr up to 20 times maintains good fit however quality of fit decreases with subsequent uses and best fit was seen after the first 5 donnings52 a veterans administration study also revealed the median tolerance time for ffr masks to be 6 to 7 hours due to heat and facial discomfort suggesting that healthcare workers cannot be expected to work prolonged shifts 12 hours in an environment which requires continuous ffr32 it should also be noted that bleach and microwave decontamination of ffrs may damage or render masks unsafe53 conversely ultraviolet irradiation and ethylene oxide may be more suitable for decontamination53 researchers at duke university recently published a verifiable decontamination protocol for n95 respirators using hydrogen peroxide vapor54 unpublished data from stanford university suggests that heating n95 masks to 70c for 30 minutes is sufficient to destroy coronavirus particles and does not diminish filtration efficiency55alternate types of nonpowered ffr include elastomeric facepiece respirators efr either half- or full-face versions commonly known as gas masks efrs employ a reusable facepiece which covers the mouth and nose half-face or mouth nose and eyes full-face with disposable filter cartridges which can filter particulates as well as vapors and gasses when using appropriate filters advantages of efr include reusability and expanded applicability however they require adequate cleaning and are known to significantly limit verbal communication between healthcare providers33powered air-purifying respirators papr and atmosphere supplying respirators provide additional protection through fan powered and filtered airflow coupled with complete enclosure of the head one specific advantage of paprs is they may be used by individuals with facial hair or those who fail standard fit tests for ffr they also provide low-resistance breathing and often do not touch the face which may be more comfortable they have components which can be reused and an apf of 2534 more advanced forms of ppe used in industry and firefighting include supplied air respirators apf  1000 and self-contained breathing apparatus apf  1000034 the authors could not find specific data regarding these types of respirators as they pertain to the protection or transmission of sars-cov or sars-cov-2 in healthcare workersas of march 30 2020 the authors were unable to find published cases of transmission of sars-cov or sars-cov-2 from patients to surgeons or operating room staff but news sources that have reported this during transsphenoidal surgery56 all protocols for ppe use in the operating room must therefore be inferred operating rooms and airborne infectious isolation rooms must have a minimum of 20 air changes per hour and do not recirculate to other rooms which translates into 999 efficiency for the removal of air in 21 minutes57 by comparison nonisolation patient rooms have a minimum of 4 air changes per hour and may recirculate air57 it is known that aerosol transmission of infectious diseases can be influenced by ventilation958 which suggests that transmission of sars-cov-2 may be lower in an operating room this must be weighed however against the fact that aerosolizing procedures are much more likely to take place in an operating roomintubation is thought to be a particularly high-risk aerosolizing procedure viral loads of sars-cov-2 are known to be high in the upper respiratory tract of infected patients59 and a study of critical care nurses from toronto during the sars-cov epidemic found that these nurses were more likely to become infected when present during intubations29 for this reason specific recommendations regarding ppe for intubation of patients with covid-19 have been made60 sars-cov-2 is also present in bodily tissues although nearly all patients 93 have evidence of virus in their sputum some 29 also have virus in the stool61 only 1 have evidence of virus in the blood61 taken together this suggests that pulmonary and upper respiratory surgeries are likely to be higher risk but that colorectal and gastrointestinal surgeries may also have greater risk of transmission questions have been raised regarding risk during laparoscopic surgery and if cauterization can aerosolize sars-cov-262 there is evidence that hepatitis b virus and human papillomavirus may become aerosolized during electrocautery6364 although they both are dna viruses that have different mechanisms of transmission and sites of infection compared to sars-cov-2 challenging this inference nevertheless given the paucity of data and since it is known that virus rna may be within the stool every attempt should be made to minimize the evacuation of cautery smoke into the operating room per current guidelines from the society of american gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgeons65 this can be done using devices that filter released carbon dioxide65a study of 3 patients with sars-cov who underwent caesarean sections reported that no healthcare workers in the operating room were infected when using the following ppe powered air-purifying respirator with a hood covering the face and shoulders goggles gown gloves and cap66 of note 2 out of 3 of these patients developed wound infections but their being treated with high-dose steroids may have been a confounder66 before the covid-19 pandemic use of paprs in combination with body suits was already popular in orthopedic surgery a randomized controlled trial that accrued from 1974 to 1979 demonstrated that orthopedic surgeons who used paprs had significantly decreased aerosolized bacterial counts in the operating room and decreased incidence of deep joint sepsis35 the application of this study to modern operating rooms however has come into question36 a study of simulated joint surgery using fluorescein demonstrated that spread of respirable particulate matter to the proceduralist was eliminated with a powered air-purifying respirator and a level 4 gown67 a similar study also showed that individuals wearing surgical masks without a papr had evidence of particulate matter within their nostrils eyebrows and eyelashes68 although certainly not definitive these studies suggest that papr may be effective in reducing aerosolized transmission of covid-19protocols for running an operating room during the covid-19 pandemic have emerged in the last month606970 wong et al70 recommended reviewing the patient inducing anesthesia operating and recovering all within the operating room itself in contrast ti et al69 recommended anesthesia inductions in a separate negative pressure room both authors recommend or staff wear at minimum n95 masks goggles or face shield gown and boot covers with a powered air-purifying respirator for intubation and aerosol-generating procedures6970 ti et al69 recommended a runner be stationed outside the operating room to get supplies and deliver them to a trolley which is pushed into an anteroom that is then accessed by a member of the operating room team this may limit the amount of ppe used with every entry and exit from the operating room60 it has also been recommended that postoperatively all team members shower69 a covid-19 operating room coordinator and a team huddle before surgery may be used to facilitate smooth transitions of care and appropriate use of ppe6070 we have compiled a list of recommendations from our institution regarding operating room ppe use during the covid-19 pandemic table 3there is a paucity of data on the optimal postoperative management of patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection we were unable to find reliable guidance on the risks of deep breathing incentive spirometry ambulation outside the room or other maneuvers as part of pulmonary hygiene a single report in press describes 3 patients who underwent elective operations incisional hernia repair cholecystectomy hysterectomy and were found to have covid-19 in the postoperative period 2 out of these 3 patients died71 although this small series cannot truly tell what a patients risk is if they contract covid-19 in the perioperative period it suggests that strong consideration should be taken for nonemergency operations at this timeif elective or semielective surgery is not being performed on patients with covid-19 this is an additional modality to protect surgeons and operating room teams to this end many institutions including ours are utilizing multidisciplinary teams to determine which procedures can be delayed protocols are evolving to allow for preoperative testing of patients in the semielective surgical setting to ascertain the safest scenarios both for the healthcare team and for the patient as resources are made available specifically testing mechanisms this approach will certainly be adopted by mirroring the approach of countries such as china who were first to experience this pandemic ultimately the most effective mitigation of risk for the entirety of the population will be the generation of viable effective vaccines that will provide protection for the at-risk populationuse of ppe is but one of myriad factors in the effort to mitigate the transmission of hospital acquired infections other factors in transmission some mentioned above include aerosol and droplet dynamics infectious particle settling rate ventilation and air distribution patterns humidity and temperature number of infected number of susceptible length of exposure type and degree of invasive procedures uv light and chemical exposure and persistence of pathogens within a host58 use of ppe and to what extent ppe are used however can often be individually decided upon by physicians the premise of this review was not so much to make recommendations because many hospitals organizations and societies have already done so it was rather to explain the data that exist and we presume how these recommendations came to be made furthermore this body of work can serve as a reference for decision making regarding how and when ppe are used when healthcare providers feel they have a choice or when they are requesting more ppe additional data will be needed to better allocate these now very valuable resourcesat the end of 2019 the first cases of a pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology were detected in wuhan city china in the following months this new pathogen spread throughout europe and then worldwide in march 2020 the world health organization who officially declared a pandemic alertthis new virus highly infective especially through airborne transmission is responsible for an acute respiratory syndrome distinguished by an often asymptomatic but potentially lethal interstitial bilateral pneumonia
1
 this virus initially named 2019ncov and subsequently renamed sarscov2 belongs to the coronoviridae family along with the middle east respiratory syndrome merscov and the severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscov viruses
2
 the most updated epidemiological and genetic studies performed on infected chinese patients revealed that this pandemic originated from a zoonosis after a single transmission event between an animal and a human followed by subsequent rapid interhuman diffusion
1
 
3
sarscov2 expresses membrane proteins that permit adhesion between it and specific receptors expressed on the surface of host tissue cells
4
 the most common receptor involved in the viruscell interaction is angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which is present at high concentrations in lungs myocardial cells and kidney as well as on oral mucosa especially of the salivary glands and tongue
5
 
6
 these structures have been considered as early targets of sarscov2 with infection causing a disease in humans known as corona virus disease 19 covid19
7
the main infection pathways of sarscov2 are air and direct contact
1
 airborne infection occurs through droplets released by coughing sneezing exhalation or speech
1
 
8
 directcontact infection occurs through contact with contaminated surfaces and subsequent touching of the eyes nose or mouth
8
 figure 

1
 saliva also plays a crucial role in the spread of infection through both airborne and directcontact pathways
1
the incubation period of sarscov2 varies between 3 and 14 days however a 24day incubation period has also been reported
9
 in most instances the infection brought on by this new coronavirus is asymptomatic or causes few symptoms
2
 infected patients mainly exhibit night fever dry cough sore throat and asthenia patients with more severe disease can exhibit dyspnea the most severe symptoms occur in 1525 of infected patients with a relevant impairment of respiratory function that leads to hospitalisation and assisted ventilation
2
 from a clinical perspective this infection presents as a bilateral interstitial pneumonia detected radiographically as bilateral groundglass opacity
10
 
11
covid19 diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms eg asthenia dyspnea headache and hyperpyrexia and epidemiological aspects particularly involving patients who had previous contact with potentially infected individuals or who travelled throughresided in areas with high concentrations of infected people in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset
9
recently a sudden loss of smell anosmia andor taste ageusia has been encountered in many sarscov2positive patients anosmia has been reportedly observed in most sarscov2positive german swiss and italian patients data from korea suggest that 30 of sarscov2positive patients exhibited anosmia as the primary presenting symptom
12
 a highresolution chest computed tomography scan can show bilateral impairment of lung parenchyma
13
 biomolecular diagnosis is performed through reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr of samples taken from the upper airways thus far this procedure is the gold standard for correctly diagnosing sarscov2positivity
3
no vaccine is yet available infected patients are mostly treated with assisted ventilation oxygen administration 215 lmin and fluid maintenance
14
 promising results have been reported concerning the development of recombinant monoclonal antibodies for a specific viral antigen as previously tested on patients with sarscov
15
this literature overview focuses on publications regarding this new coronavirus and supplies valuable indications to dental professionals concerning protective and preventive measures that can be adoptedpubmed embase scopus web of science and cochrane databases were used to identify publications on covid19 and covid19 dentistryrelated aspects which had been published from the beginning of january 2020 to the end of april 2020 the terms used for the identification of keywords were covid19 2019ncov sarscov2 covid19 transmission coronavirus pneumonia coronavirus infection severe acute respiratory syndrome atmospheric contamination droplets aerosol ppedpi covid19 guidelines airborne contamination masks and respirators and covid19 dentalrelated aspects the inclusion criteria used for screening were papers written in the english language or in the italian language with an english abstract which reported on covid19 and dentistryrelated aspects of covid19 the exclusion criteria were papers in a language other than english or italian with no english abstract and studies not reported in the abovementioned databases studies were first screened according to titles and abstracts and examined by two reviewers vc and db studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected and their full texts were obtained the contents were analysed and results were extracted if the papers provided original data regarding sarscov2 citations in each article selected during the main search were reviewed for potential relevancedentists dental hygienists dental assistants and patients have always been at high risk of cross infections because of their exposure to pathogenic microorganisms and viruses derived from the oral cavity and airways
16
 
17
 these groups of professionals face daily risks of contagion and infection transmission because the dental environment typically involves dangerously high levels of microbes
18
 as a result of close contact with the patients oral cavity and the presence of bacteria and viruses in the aerosols created by dental instrumentation
1
 
16
a study performed on a mannequin fitted with phantom jaws and seated on a dental chair showed that the highest levels of aerosol contaminants can be found within 60 cm from the patients head mainly on the right arm of the dentist on their mask and around their nose and eyes moreover the aerosol generated by an ultrasonic device can remain suspended in the air for 30 minutes after the procedure
19
 therefore dental procedures can be considered as one of the most probable causes of sarscov2 infection because such procedures require close proximity to the patients mouth possess a risk of contact with saliva blood and other biological fluids and involve the use of instrumentation that creates large aerosols
4
 
19
 
20
an in vitro study showed that sarscov2 maintained viability in the air for at least 3 hours and that its viability halflife was nearly 1 hour
21
 moreover sarscov2 demonstrates persistent adherence for a maximum of 9 days to various surfaces
1
 
21
 therefore all surfaces and instruments in a dental clinic should be considered as potential sources of virus transmission because infected droplets from saliva or aerosols could land on any exposed surface
16
 
19
 
22
thus far many doubts remain regarding the type of mask that best protects against covid19 different types of mask have been developed in recent decades each mask offers a different degree of protection surgical masks were conceived with a oneway protection design  to capture bodily fluids leaving the wearer  thus protecting the patient from the risk of contamination by healthcare personnel
17
 
24
 however a study performed on mannequin heads showed that surgical masks were also able to provide a filtration effect for the operator in that they filtered an artificial aerosol made of water and sodium bicarbonate two different types of surgical masks  rectangular and shellshaped  were tested these showed filtering efficiencies of 92 and 96 respectively
24
in dentistry the most indicated ppe for airway protection is the filtering facepiece ffp mask which can also block virus particles ffp masks are designed to protect the wearer and are divided into the following different categories based on their filtration efficiency towards powders 03 m in diameter ffp1 80 minimal total filtration efficiency ffp2 94 minimal total filtration efficiency and ffp3 99 minimal total filtration efficiency
17
 
25
 these ffp scores are determined in accordance with en standard 1492001 and en 143 maintained by the european committee for standardisation by contrast us standards are determined by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh which classifies oral respirators as n95 95 minimal total filtration efficiency n99 99 minimal total filtration efficiency and n100 9997 minimal total filtration efficiency comparing european and us classifications an ffp2 respirator corresponds to an n95 mask while an ffp3 respirator corresponds to an n99 mask table 

1
because air droplet covid19 particles are estimated to be 006014 m in diameter
26
 the most efficient masks are presumed to be ffp2n95 ffp3n99 and n100 surgical masks however remain valid devices for all procedures that do not create an aerosolin addition to the filtration efficacy facepieces can be further distinguished as valved or nonvalved respirators valved respirators facilitate air exhalation leading to less moisture buildup inside the mask thus they can filter the entering air but do not filter the wearers exhaled air nonvalved respirators provide good twoway protection by filtering both inflow and outflow of air
25
 
27
ffp3n99 and n100 facepieces without valves seem to be the devices primarily indicated to guarantee the highest level of protection for both operator and patient but it is quite challenging to achieve normal air exhalation when these facepieces are used for an extended period of time 
23
 in dental procedures the mask should be considered as disposable and the mean surgical period does not exceed 2 hours therefore it is suggested to use a mask with the highest filtration efficacy without a valve or a valved mask covered by a surgical maskin the dental field eye protection has been consistently indicated to minimise contact of the eyes with mechanical eg slivers and foreign bodies chemical eg acids and disinfectants and biological eg saliva blood oral fluids agents
18
 the ocular pathway is known to be one of the most frequent routes of infection with sarscov2
1
 eyewear with enveloping frames should be used and should have wide lenses to cover the face as much as possible alternatively plastic shields may be preferred to glasses because of their greater capacity to protect the face from aerosol droplets these shields can be worn directly on the forehead or can be included in the surgical mask
17
 from a practical point of view the use of a shield is compatible with wearing glasses or magnification loupes it is much more difficult to achieve proper eye protection while using a microscopea triage area is mandatory for initial evaluation of patients and this area should be set up in such a way that close contact between individual patients and between patients and healthcare personnel is avoided
4
 preliminary evaluation of patients should consist of body temperature measurement and a brief survey to investigate possible fever respiratory issues cough or dyspnea in the past 14 days as well as contact with individuals who could have been potentially infected
1
patients answering yes to any of the survey questions and who have a body temperature of 375 c 995 f should be confined to their home or hospitalised
1
 patients answering yes to any of the survey questions to the survey and who have a body temperature of 375 c 995 f should not be treated for at least 14 days patients who have recovered from covid19 can be treated 30 days after symptom remission
4
 patients answering no to the survey questions and who have a body temperature of 375 c 995 f can be treated but procedures that cause aerosol production should be avoidedeach potentially contaminated surface should be cleaned and then disinfected with hydroalcoholic disinfectants containing an alcohol concentration of 60

28
 a recent review of 22 selected studies evaluated the persistence of human coronavirus on various surfaces and the effects of multiple disinfectant agents on virus inactivation this review revealed that coronaviruses can persist on plastic glass and metal surfaces and remain infective for a maximum of 9 days with a mean infective period of 45 days the authors found that coronavirus could be effectively eliminated in 1 minute when the surfaces were disinfected with 6271 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite
22
more recently the sarscov2 survival rate was studied in aerosols as well as on copper cardboard stainless steel and plastic sarscov2 was viable in aerosols with a progressive reduction of its infectious titre within the first 3 hours and a median halflife of approximately 11 hours
21
 moreover sarscov2 appeared to be more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on cardboard or copper the following differences were found regarding the duration before sarscov2 became inactive 72 hours for plastic 48 hours for stainless steel 24 hours for cardboard and 4 hours for copper
21
 table

 thus for environmental disinfection it may be useful to place a dispenser containing an alcoholic gel with an alcohol concentration of 6085 in the waiting room for hand cleansinga valid method to reduce the microbial load in the oral cavity is rinsing before dental procedures there remains controversy regarding the effectiveness of chlorhexidine against coronavirus
1
 
29
 because sarscov2 is sensitive to oxidation mouthrinses containing 1 hydrogen peroxide or 02 povidoneiodine have been proposed
1
hand hygiene is considered the most important preventive measure to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms between dentists and patients
4
 soap and cleansers must be rubbed extensively on both hands until the appearance of abundant foam this foam has been shown to dissolve the lipid sheath around the viruses causing dispersion and decomposition of viral molecules this action is mediated by the surfactant agents in soaps and cleansers which can enter the virus lipid membrane through hydrophobic interactions eventually causing it to lyse
30
 at concentrations greater than 6065 alcohol can dissolve fatty molecules of the external lipid layer of the virus which leads to disruption of the virus particle therefore friction with an alcoholic hand sanitiser is suggested after handwashingwhen possible it is recommended to avoid dental procedures that could cause cough and regurgitation orthopantomography opg or cone beam computed tomography cbct are preferred periapical xrays should be avoided because they could provoke hypersalivation coughing or vomiting
4
when handpieces or ultrasonic devices must be used the use of a rubber dam is indicated as this significantly reduces the amount of aerosol containing saliva andor blood providing a 70 reduction of droplets around the surgical field
31
 when isolation using a rubber dam is not possible manual instrumentation is preferred over highspeed handpieces
1
considerable reduction of droplet spread during dental procedures can be achieved using either highspeed saliva ejectors or surgical ejectors and the use of such devices is therefore highly recommended
31
 simultaneous assembly of two ejectors eg a highspeed ejector and a highvolume evacuator may also be usefulhandpieces generally used in dentistry can draw and then expel biological fluids and contaminants that can become deposited on the patient or the dentist leading to cross infection
1
 
32
 because it has been shown that antiretraction handpieces effectively reduce the return of bacteria and viruses into the tubing system the use of handpieces without an antiretraction system should be avoided during the covid19 pandemic
16
 
28
although there is a lack of information concerning environmental sanitation related to coronaviruses some options are always useful for reducing bacterial and viral loads in dental clinics common sensebased guidelines suggest an adequate air change after each dental procedure by opening the windows in surgical rooms and in the waiting room safe distances must be maintained between patients in the waiting roomin the early 1990s the air quality in a dental clinic was shown to become extremely polluted by aerial microbiota after the most common dental procedures
16
 when no aerosol is created most sarscov2 droplets precipitate and deposit on surfaces when handpieces or ultrasonic devices are used the aerosol generated can transmit the virus into the air where it can persist viable for more than 3 hours
21
currently there is no evidence regarding sanitation devices that are especifically effective against sarscov2 the following air sanitation systems were developed in the past and are commonly used in medical settingsair depuration systems have been developed to filter and recirculate the air of surgical rooms and medical and health clinics air is drawn through different filters the first stops bacteria and larger droplets the second reduces gas components and the third reduces the numbers of the smallest droplet particles and the smallest microorganisms these systems can filter droplet particles smaller than 00103 m with a filtration efficiency of 8599

ozone is a natural gas and one of the most effective systems for environmental sanitation it provides highly reactive free radicals that can oxidise bacteria viruses and organic and inorganic compounds thereby effecting bactericidal action towards air contaminants because ozone is heavier than oxygen it precipitates on tissues and disinfects both air and surfaces
34
germicidal ultraviolet uv radiation also represents a valid sterilisation option uv light can damage microbial dna and rna thus preventing reproduction of microbes and reducing the harmful effects of infectious organisms these uv lights can be installed with a filtration apparatus and used in water and aircirculation systems to eliminate powders bacteria and viruses

to the editorthe us centers for disease control and prevention cdc recently recommended the use of face masks in public settings to help slow the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus1 currently a mask shortage continues in the united states and around the globe in contrast taiwan has had a surplus of masks since february and exported masks in april to other countries to help fight this pandemic in this letter we discuss how taiwan ensured adequate stockpiles of masks for both healthcare workers and the general populationtaiwan registered its first case of covid-19 on january 21 20202 as of april 17 2020 taiwan has recorded just 395 cases of covid-19 in response to the emerging threat of covid-19 the taiwanese government produced a stockpile of 44 million surgical and 193 million n95 masks before the first case was reported fig 1a3 subsequently the government implemented bans on exportation and requisition of mask-manufacturing companies to ensure adequate local reserves of masks the government also introduced price fixing of masks to prevent bidding wars and to ensure universal access of masks to all citizens rationing of surgical masks was implemented to prevent panic buying of masks which would drain local supplies the mask rationing system was delicately adjusted according to the production of masks and the amount required by healthcare workers while ensuring that the entire population had adequate access fig 1a

the initial rationing system limited every person to 2 surgical masks per week the purchase was tracked using the individuals national health insurance cardhealth insurance that covers 99 of residents with the resumption of school classes on february 21 the purchase limit for surgical masks was increased to 4 masks per week for children fig 1a4 with the increased production of masks the quota increased to 5 masks for children and 3 masks for adults per week by the end of february taiwan was producing 5 million masks daily and had a substantial surplus of masks fig 1b4 as of april 9 2020 the purchase quota was increased to 9 surgical masks per person per 2 weeks the ban on the export of masks was lifted and taiwanese nationals can now send masks to relatives residing abroad to help the rest of the world to battle the pandemic taiwan also exported 10 million masks to the united states europe and its allies in april 20204
since the outbreak many asian countries have recommended or mandated the use of surgical masks in the healthy general population5 previously the us cdc recommended that masks should only be worn by healthcare workers caregivers or symptomatic individuals part of this rationale was that universal masking in the general population may limit the amount of masks available to healthcare settings however taiwans example illustrates that this supply problem may be overcome through a combination of policies such as increased mask production and rationing and ensuring that the demand and supply of masks remain in balance fig 1balthough the use of surgical masks in the healthy population has not been directly proven to reduce the spread of the coronavirus it may provide source control and protect against asymptomatic transmission5 recent mechanistic studies have suggested that surgical masks may reduce the transmission of the coronavirus if worn by patients6 furthermore a recent meta-analysis showed that masking practices may produce marginal reduction in transmission of respiratory virus in the community7 at a population level even marginal reduction in transmission may substantially slow the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus economically mask interventions have been shown to be cost saving in a pandemic setting8 taiwan created a sufficient stockpile of masks for both the healthcare settings and the general population and its example could serve as a model for other countries to learn from as we continue our fight against the covid-19 pandemiccoronavirus disease covid-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread to 216 countries in just a few months the numbers of cases and deaths have been on the rise since the first case was identified in wuhan china in early december 2019 1 the covid-19 pandemic has posed a great challenge for healthcare systems as the disease has spread explosively exceeding hospital capacities and placing healthcare workers hcws at high risk of exposure the proportion of infected hcws among confirmed cases was reported to be 10 in italy and 20 in spain 2 in the united states us approximately 3 of confirmed cases are hcws and 55 of these reported exposure to covid-19 patients only in healthcare settings 3 infected hcws could also be a source of infection for patients and other hcws protecting hcws is of paramount importance to maintain continuous patient care and keep healthcare systems functioningmeasures to prevent transmission of sars-cov-2 to hcws include all levels of hazard control administrative controls engineering controls and personal protective equipment ppe administrative controls include implementing triage early recognition of suspected patients source control providing adequate training for hcws monitoring adherence to infection control policies and procedures and implementing measures to minimize contact with covid-19 patients ie using telemedicine to initially evaluate suspected patients or designating dedicated hcws to care only for covid-19 patients engineering controls include placing suspected or confirmed patients in an airborne-infection isolation room maintaining adequate ventilation and using physical barriers to prevent transmission between patients and hcws 456 along with these control measures the use of ppe is the last line of defense and a critical component the choice of ppe is based on the nature of interactions with patients and the modes of transmission 7current data suggest sars-cov-2 is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact airborne transmission may be possible during aerosol-generating procedures agps 891011 however there is still uncertainty surrounding the modes of sars-cov-2 transmission which caused differences in the ppe recommendations of the world health organization who and those of individual countries 12 in korea the first case of covid-19 was identified on january 20 2020 and it spread throughout the country during the initial phase of the pandemic the government issued guidelines for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings selection of appropriate ppe was based on previous guidelines for the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in 2015 inconsistencies among these guidelines were also noted after several updates the ppe recommendations offered options when choosing ppe for respiratory and body protection however selection of optimal ppe is often misinterpreted and misunderstoodthis review discusses the previous and recent evidence on the mode of transmission of respiratory transmissible viruses in conjunction with sars-cov-2 the current ppe recommendations in korea in comparison with those of the who and other organizations and the standard requirements and proper selection of ppe for respiratory and body protectionin general respiratory viruses can spread through multiple modes of transmission contact respiratory droplets or aerosols 13 contact transmission can occur through direct physical contact with virus-laden respiratory secretions from infected individuals or indirectly through contact with inanimate objects or environments contaminated with the virus 13 conventionally respiratory transmission is classified as either droplet or airborne transmission 47 it is generally accepted that droplet transmission occurs through deposition of large droplets 5 m in diameter on the mucous membranes eyes nose or mouth of susceptible people it occurs when a person is in close proximity to an infected person as large droplets travel only short distances 1 m airborne transmission occurs through inhalation of aerosols 5 m in diameter generated from the respiratory tract of an infected person aerosols remain suspended in the air for a prolonged period allowing them to be transmitted over a long distance 4however mode of transmission cannot be simply dichotomized there is no clear cut-off to differentiate small and large droplets different cutoffs have been suggested based on the area of the respiratory tract where particles deposit respirable particles 10 m in diameter penetrating the lower respiratory tract or inspirable particles 10 - 100 m in diameter depositing in the upper respiratory tract 14 or based on how they behave particles 10 m in diameter suspended in the air or particles 20 m in diameter that settle fast by gravity 15 particle size is dynamic it depends on the initial size and composition the force and pressure at emission environmental conditions eg temperature relative humidity and airflow and the time spent airborne 4 the distance traveled and the length of time particles remain suspended in the air is also determined by particle size settling velocity relative humidity and airflow 16 large droplets settle faster due to gravity contaminating the near vicinity some of them can rapidly evaporate to form aerosol particles termed droplet nuclei which behave as other aerosols settled droplets may facilitate fomite transmission and can be re-suspended in the air by diverse human activities large droplets can also move horizontally for more than 2 meters from the source during coughing or up to 8 meters during sneezing 17 they can remain suspended for prolonged periods in certain environments especially where turbulent airflow is abundant such as in hospital settings where doors open constantly 15 particles of varying sizes 001  500 m are produced not only by medical procedures but also by respiratory activities such breathing speaking singing coughing or sneezing 18192021 the proportion of aerosol-size particles differs according to the respiratory activities and individuals 21 as such it is important to understand that the size of the particles and the resulting behavior follows a continuum it may overlap either side of this cut-off 21however being airborne does not in itself guarantee effective transmission through aerosols the virus in aerosols must remain viable in a sufficient quantity to be inhaled by a susceptible host the virus contained in droplets is subject to biological decay over time which is affected by the initial metabolic state of the virus genetic characteristics and the environment 2223 in this context the relative contribution of different modes of transmission should be considered albeit the possibility of airborne transmission does exist airborne transmission can be classified as obligate preferential or opportunistic in obligate airborne transmission transmission occurs only via inhalation of aerosols eg in tuberculosis though transmission occurs through multiple routes in preferential airborne transmission it predominately occurs through aerosols eg in measles varicella in opportunistic airborne transmission the virus is transmitted predominantly through other routes however the virus may be transmitted through aerosols under favorable circumstances where aerosols are generated by performing agps eg in influenza sars-cov-1 infection 72224the current consensus regarding the transmission of sars-cov-2 is that it is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and contact and that airborne transmission is possible during agps 9101125 although no study has conclusively linked sars-cov-2 transmission to contaminated environmental surfaces indirect contact with fomites is considered a possible route based on the evidence of heavy environmental contamination in healthcare settings objects used by covid-19 patients 2627 and the finding that the virus remains viable on plastic surfaces for as long as 3 days 28however there has been controversy whether sars-cov-2 can become airborne when agps are not performed some studies have suggested the potential of airborne sars-cov-2 transmission in one experimental study viable sars-cov-2 was detected in the air for 3 hours when an aerosolized environment was created using a three-jet collison nebulizer and a goldberg drum 28 however though this experimental condition may simulate circumstances when agps are performed it does not reflect real-life clinical settings a study in nebraska detected viral rna in air samples collected in covid-19 patient rooms more than 6 feet way from the source patient and in the hallway outside patient rooms but failed to detect viable virus in air samples 29 guo et al detected sars-cov-2 rna in air samples collected in intensive care units and general wards at a hospital in wuhan but the viral rna was not detected on face shields in buffer rooms or in doffing rooms 30 liu et al also found a high concentration of viral rna in air samples from patients toilet areas and staff ppe removal areas in two hospitals in wuhan suggesting re-suspension of the virus from contaminated surfaces 31 however both studies in wuhan did not investigate the infectivity of the virus in those air samples the presence of viral rna in the air does not necessarily indicate viable virus in sufficient amounts to cause infection nor does it mean that the virus can effectively be transmitted through this route 1132 further studies are needed to determine whether it is possible to detect viable sars-cov-2 in air samples from patient rooms in which no agps are performed and what role it may play in transmission more importantly in the study by liu et al viral rna was reduced to undetectable levels in staff ppe removal areas after implementation of rigorous disinfection procedures which emphasizes the importance of environmental disinfection to prevent the spread of the virus in the perspectives of infection prevention and control in contrast other studies have shown that viral rna was not detected in air samples collected from covid-19 patient rooms 26 10 cm away from the patients chin 27 or 2-5 meters away from the patient 33 transmission did not occur among hcws wearing surgical masks when they were exposed to a covid-19 patient even during endotracheal intubation 3435 no instances of transmission were observed among hcws caring for covid-19 patients when they used surgical masks as part of ppe routine care 36based on these findings it is believed that sars-cov-2 is mainly transmitted through droplets and contact and that airborne transmission is possible under certain circumstances when aerosols are generated during agps or support treatment 911 at the same time the possibility of airborne transmission should carefully be considered as new evidence emergesin this context the who currently recommends droplet and contact precautions for hcws caring for covid-19 patients and airborne precautions for settings where agps or support treatment are performed 25 for droplet precaution use of medical masks also referred to as surgical masks and eye protection goggles or face shields is recommended for contact precaution long-sleeved water-resistant gowns and gloves are recommended when agps are performed use of n95 filtering facepiece ffp2 ffp3 or equivalent respirators is recommended instead of surgical masks and additional use of aprons is suggested if gowns are not fluid-resistant 37 table 1 however there are inconsistences in the recommendations of organizations and countries ppe recommendations in canada 38 australia 39 and the united kingdom 40 are consistent with those put forth by the who the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the european center for disease control and prevention ecdc initially recommended airborne precautions for any situations involving contact with covid-19 patients however they have modified their recommendations to specify that surgical masks are acceptable alternatives if respirators are not available 910 despite this difference airborne precautions are commonly recommended when agps are performed table 1 although the transmission risk for hcws may differ based on procedure being performed 41 agps listed in the guidelines generally include endotracheal intubation bronchoscopy tracheostomy cardiopulmonary resuscitation sputum induction non-invasive ventilation manual ventilation airway suctioning and nebulizer therapy in the ecdc guidelines prone positioning of the patient and disconnecting the patient from a ventilator are also considered agps 1042 surgery or procedures in which high-speed devices are used can also generate aerosols 43 although it remains uncertain whether sars-cov-2 is transmitted through this route such procedures may impose substantial transmission risk in dental-clinic settings 44 collecting nasopharyngealoropharyngeal swabs for sars-cov-2 tests can provoke coughing and sneezing possibly leading to the production of aerosols 910 however this procedure requires less time and may pose a less significant risk than other agps for this reason the recommended respiratory protective equipment for collecting swabs differs among guidelines table 1 the australian and canadian guidelines emphasize the need for a point-of-care risk assessment to determine the likelihood of exposure based on a patients symptoms tasks and specific environments 3845in korea airborne and contact precautions continue to be recommended in any situations involving any contact with suspected or confirmed patients with some modifications initially the korea center for disease control and prevention kcdc guidelines recommended coveralls with shoe covers for contact precautions gogglesface shields for eye protection n95 or equivalent respirators for respiratory protection and powered air-purifying respirators paprs when agps are performed 46 in the march 2020 revision of these guidelines long-sleeved water-resistant gowns and kf94 masks were recommended 47 these modifications may have caused confusion and misunderstanding among hcws 48 to select appropriate ppe it is important to know the differences among respiratory protective equipment respirators surgical masks paprs and protective clothing coveralls gowns and their benefits and drawbacksmost surgical masks are composed of three-layers an outer fluid-repelling layer a middle layer serving as a high filter and an inner moisture-absorbing layer surgical masks without this three-layer feature cannot provide adequate protection 53 in the us and europe surgical masks are classified as medical devices and regulated accordingly in the us five elements are tested to standardize their quality fluid resistance to synthetic blood particulate and bacterial filtration efficiency breathing resistance pressure drop flammability and biocompatibility 5455 in europe similar standard requirements have been adopted 56 surgical masks are categorized into levels 1 2 or 3 in the us and i ii or iir in europe table 2in korea however there are no minimum standards or standardized testing methods to determine the filtering efficiency of surgical masks and the efficiency of the filters in available surgical masks may vary widely fluid resistance to water is the only performance test required for surgical masks in korea 57 fluid resistance reflects only one of the surgical masks purposes to minimize the amount of fluid that could transfer from the outer layers through to the inner layer in cases of splash or spray however the surface tension of water is greater than that of blood and blood can penetrate through fabrics more readily than water 5859 the lack of equivalent korean standards makes it difficult for hcws to choose appropriate surgical masks as recommended by the who also it is difficult to uniformly recommend the use of any surgical mask during care for patients with covid-19 in korea unless reliable korean standards for surgical masks are established healthcare facilities should cautiously check whether products meet the standard requirements when procuring surgical masks for hcwsffrs are labeled according to their filtering efficiency and the national regulations defining the standard conditions in the us there are nine classes of ffrs according to filtration efficacy 95 99 and 9997 and the filters oil resistance n r and p n95 respirators filter 95 of airborne particles 03 microns in size and are not resistant to oil they are regulated under niosh cfr part 84 60 the european standard en1492001 places ffrs into three classes ffp1 ffp2 and ffp3 according to their filtering efficiency 80 94 and 99 respectively 6162 as the korean standards follow the european standards ffrs manufactured in korea are classified similarly kf80 kf94 and kf99 table 3 6263 ffp23 and kf9499 respirators are used for hcws in addition to a filtering efficiency test a breathing resistance test pressure drop is required pressure drop is an objective measure of breathability a high pressure drop indicates more difficulty in breathing kf94 and ffp2 respirators require 70 pa at an airflow rate of 30 lmin whereas n95 respirators require 343 pa at 85 lmin since pressure drop increases with the flow rate standard pressure drop requirements are similar even though they appear different 6465 in korea and europe total inward leakage til is also tested on human subjects table 3 62 in the us the til test is not performed instead fit testing must be performed prior to working in the environment where wearing a respirator is required and be repeated annually under the occupational safety and health administration osha regulation 1910134 66 despite differences in test methods it is generally considered that us n95 eu ffp2 and kf94 respirators are equivalent for filtering non-oil based airborne particles 646567however concerns have been raised because the fit test is not regularly performed in many korean hospitals despite the korea osha recommending a fit test for wearers every year 6869 respirators must fit the face tightly for effective filtering of airborne particles noti et al demonstrated that a poorly-fitting n95 respirator was not as effective as a tightly fitting respirator at blocking infectious viruses 665 vs 996 blocked respectively and performed no better than unsealed surgical masks 665 vs 566 blocked respectively in a simulation experiment 70 in korea the til test is performed on ten human subjects doing five types of exercise 63 this til test can eliminate respirators that are inherently poorly-fitting and that do not comply with this requirement or identify that the tested respirator is generally well-fitting however fitting is affected by a wearers face shape and size age and gender as well as the respirator design 7172 fit testing helps to select a respirator model that fits an individuals face well enough to provide at least the assigned protection factor of 10 73 fit performance was also found to vary by respirator model ranging from fitting less than 5 to those fitting 95 of the test subjects 71 in addition to the model type ear-loop designs appear to be less effective in achieving a proper fit than head-band designs 67 this is worrisome since most kf94 masks have ear loops as agps may put hcws at an increased risk for virus exposure and infection the design of kf94 masks limits their use during agps kf94 masks of various shapes and sizes and with elastic head-band designs should be offered to hcws to improve the fitting of the masks a recent study on the current status of fit testing in korea showed that 82 of 52 hcws failed to meet the criteria of fit factor 100 even when using n95 respirators 68 considering these findings hcws should be fit-tested for ffrs regardless of their labels kf94 n95 or ffp2 to ensure respiratory protection though it is challenging and laborious for hospitals to implement fit testing practices for all hcws in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic protecting hcws is of paramount importanceeven so fit testing alone does not guarantee respiratory protection 74 inappropriate donning and skipping the self-seal-check after donning an ffr were found to be frequent causes of improper fit 6874 since training on the proper use of ffrs can improve fitting of the respirators among hcws 7475 training programs should be implemented along with fit testingthe risk of exposure to blood or bodily fluids should also be considered when selecting the proper ffrs because most ffrs are not water-resistant to protect hcws against the splashspray of blood or bodily fluids as well as airborne particles ie during an operation on a patient with covid-19 surgical respirators with fluid resistance properties should be used 49 a surgical n95 respirator which is approved by the niosh as an ffr and the fda as a surgical mask is one examplepaprs are increasingly used as an alternative to n95 respirators paprs use a battery-powered fan to force air through a filter cartridge or canister to a tight-fitting facepiece or loose-fitting hood 49 loose-fitting paprs are commonly used in healthcare settings as they have several advantages higher respiratory protection with an assigned protection factor of 25 as compared to 10 for n95 respirators a barrier against splash and less difficulty in breathing they are also reusable and do not require fit testing 5076however there are disadvantages to paprs use they are heavy may impede hcws ability to care for patients limit communication due to noise require batteries to be recharged or replaced and take up significant storage space 76 although a fit test is not required they do need to be properly sized as protection can decrease with oversized or stretched-out paprs 77 another disadvantage is that the wearers exhaled air is unfiltered which limits the use of paprs in close proximity to sterile fields 5076 more importantly risk of contamination during doffing procedures is high requiring hcws to receive special training and assistance in the doffing process cleaning and disinfection must be performed between uses this process must be thorough and performed by trained individualsloose-fitting paprs are suitable when agps are frequently performed such as in intensive care unit settings when hcws are not able to wear tight-fitting ffrs or when the fitting of a ffr may be compromised for safe use healthcare facilities should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages associated with paprs they must also establish a robust maintenance program including hcw training for proper papr use and the cleaning and disinfection process prior to the use of paprs 7678infectious aerosol particles are produced by diverse respiratory activities including speaking and breathing 7980 hcws in close proximity to patients with covid-19 are at risk of short-range airborne transmission as well as large-droplet transmission 81 as such there have been debates regarding the effectiveness of surgical masks against the virus in routine patient care and use of n95 respirators or the equivalent is often advocated 82 however no clinical trial has compared the effectiveness of surgical masks and n95 respirators in preventing covid-19 among hcws based on the systematic review of five observational studies on hcws wearing any mask surgical mask or n95 respirator reduced the risk of developing respiratory infection odds ratio or for surgical masks 013 95 confidence interval ci 003 - 062 vs or for n95 respirators 012 95 ci 005 - 026 83 a recent randomized clinical trial in the us demonstrated no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza between outpatient hcws wearing surgical masks and those wearing n95 respirators 84 two meta-analyses which were separately performed by different research groups reached the same conclusion surgical masks and n95 respirators offer similar protection against respiratory viral infection among hcws during non-aerosol-generating care 8586 based on these findings the infectious disease society of america recommends that hcws caring for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 use either a surgical mask or n95 or n99 or prpr respirator and that hcws involved in agps use n95 or higher-level respirators 83 chu et al investigated the effectiveness of face masks in preventing transmission of sars mers or covid-19 in healthcare and non-healthcare settings by analyzing 44 observational studies they found that the use of face masks 12 - 16-layer cotton masks surgical masks n95 or similar respirators resulted in a large reduction of infection risk in healthcare settings relative risk rr 030 95 ci 022 - 041 n95 or similar respirators had a stronger protective association rr 004 95 ci 0004 - 030 than surgical masks or 12 - 16-layer cotton masks rr 033 95 ci 017 - 061 and both n95 and surgical masks had a strong association with protection when compared to single-layer masks 87 the review however included only four studies comparing n95 or similar respirators with no mask and two of them involved situations in which agps were performed based on this review alone it is difficult to generalize that the use of n95 or similar respirators provides more protection during routine care for patients with covid-19 therefore the use of n95 ffp2 or higher-level respirators such as paprs should be prioritized when agps are performed it is also necessary to vigilantly monitor situations or procedures that may increase the possibility of aerosol transmission because many of the characteristics of sars-cov-2 remain unknownthe choice of protective clothing should be based on a thorough risk assessment of potential exposure to blood and body fluids and transmission modes the risk of exposure may depend on the stage of the disease the severity of symptoms and the types of procedures conducted once the risks are assessed selection can be guided by the type of barrier design critical properties such as seamsclosures and donning and doffing features of the clothingthe who cdc and ecdc recommend the use of long-sleeved water-resistant gowns and gloves when caring for covid-19 patients in its recent publication on the rational use of ppe the who also specifies situations in which gowns should be donned according to the who dcp for covid-19 en 13975 any performance level gowns or association for the advancement of medical instrumentation aami pb70 all level or equivalent gowns are acceptable 52 regarding coveralls as ppe against covid-19 the who stated they are neither required nor generally recommended and the cdc recommends them as an alternative in contingency situations on the other hand in korea initial recommendations recommended only coveralls for body protection the guidelines were subsequently changed to specify that either gowns or coveralls can be used this may cause confusion among frontline hcws regarding what kind of protective clothing should be chosen moreover there is no national standard for hcw protective clothing in korea therefore it is necessary to understand the relevant international standards and test methods to select and procure the proper protective clothingin the us surgical and isolation gowns are medical devices subjected to regulation ansiaami pb70 classifies surgical gowns and isolation gowns into 4 levels level 1 being the lowest level 4 being the highest based on their liquid barrier performance 88 tests for level 1 - 3 gowns use water but level 4 gowns are required to pass blood and viral penetration resistance tests at a pressure of 138 pa which is considered water-impermeable table 4 59 the designs of surgical and isolation gowns are based on the anticipated location critical zones and degree of liquid contact for isolation gowns the whole garment is anticipated to have direct contact with blood bodily fluids or pathogens and the entire gown including the seams needs to achieve barrier performance for surgical gowns the front panel and lower sleeves of the gown are required to achieve barrier performance 88 the european standard en13759 classifies gowns as either high performance or standard performance based on their resistance to liquid and microbial penetration table 4 5989 for gowns to protect hcws from infectious agents the garments must meet the standard en 14126 performance requirements which include tests for penetration resistance to bloodbodily fluids iso 16603 or to blood-borne pathogens iso 16604 under different hydrostatic pressures ranging from class 1 0 kpa to class 6 20 kpa 5989 this standard is usually also used to evaluate and classify coveralls for hcws in europe in the us the nfpa 1999 standard is used to classify clothing items including coveralls for hcws the materials and seams are tested for viral penetration resistance using astm f1671 and the overall liquid integrity strength and physical hazard resistance are also tested 59as there are various performance levels of gowns and coveralls it cannot be simply concluded that one is more protective than the other the specific barrier properties should be thoroughly reviewed and protective clothing appropriate for specific diseases should be selected accordingly for example for ebola virus disease which is mainly transmitted through contact with blood or bodily fluids gowns and coveralls should be resistant to penetration by blood and any bodily fluids or by blood-borne pathogens and compliant with the corresponding standards fluid-resistant protective clothing includes ansiaami pb70 level 3 or en 13795 high performance gowns and coveralls made of fabrics passing tests using astm 1670 138 kpa iso 16603 class 3 or higher pressure 35 kpa protective clothing resistant to blood-borne pathogen penetration includes ansiaami level 4 gowns or coveralls made of fabric passing tests using astm f1671 138 kpa iso 16604 class 2 or higher pressure 175 kpa 90 for covid-19 any water-resistant level gowns are acceptable 52 thus the proper level of gown protection should be chosen based on the risk assessment of exposure the pressure and type of contact as well as the duration and type of procedure 91no study has compared the effectiveness of gowns and coveralls in reducing transmission of the virus to hcws and gowns and coveralls are generally considered acceptable and effective 5992 one of the major differences is the design coveralls are designed to cover the whole body including the back and lower legs while gowns do not provide continuous whole body protection when wearing gowns protection of the back area can be compromised depending on the activities of hcws such as squatting or sitting down so sufficient overlap of fabric is necessary to cover the back on the other hand barrier protection can be compromised when using coveralls with a front zipper closure not covered with a flap of barrier material because seam barrier properties are essential for protection 59 gowns are easier to don and doff and they are more likely to be used correctly as hcws are relatively more familiar with gowns than with coveralls in contrast coveralls are difficult to doff and the risk of self-contamination can be higher during the doffing process 599394959697 hcws should be trained properly and should practice the use of coveralls before using them during patient care moreover coveralls generate more heat stress than do gowns which leads to discomfort fatigue and dehydration considering these differences the decision of which of the two to use should be based on availability hcw activities and the physical characteristics of the work environment 59in summary current data suggest that sars-cov-2 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact airborne transmission may occur during agps in healthcare settings ppe for droplet and contact precautions such as surgical masks with eye protection gowns and gloves are recommended for hcws in contact with suspected or confirmed covid-19 patients and n95 or equivalent respirators should to be worn by hcws whenever agps are performed although droplets and close contact are the main modes of sars-cov-2 transmission selection of the proper ppe should be based on a through risk assessment of the extent and duration of exposure and the properties of the ppe required for protection degrees of respiratory protection and barrier properties differ according to various standards and test methods therefore it is important to understand the national or international standards for respiratory protective equipment and protective clothing and ppe certified to provide effective protection against sars-cov-2 should be chosen healthcare facilities must check the specifications of products thoroughly before procuring them it is also important to ensure that hcws are well trained for the proper use of ppe because appropriate donning and doffing is essential for proper protection the overuse of ppe can lead to supply shortages when high levels of protection must be used potentially exposing hcws to greater risk of infection therefore ppe should be appropriately selected and rationally used it should bear in mind that ppe is the last line of protection and its use alone does not effectively reduce transmission risk effective administrative and engineering controls including early identification of suspected patients and source control must be implemented simultaneously furthermore basic infection prevention measures such as frequent hand washing and rigorous environmental cleaning and disinfection must be emphasized as the occurrence of airborne transmission when agps are not performed remains uncertain ppe recommendations are subject to change in accordance with future study results healthcare facilities and hcws should be vigilantly aware of such changes in recommended ppe and prepare for the futureacute respiratory tract infections artis are the most common causes of both morbidity and mortality worldwide especially in developing countries1 in saudi arabia viral pathogens are the most common of artis with the highest detection rate in children2when large numbers of people come together for a social function a huge public event or sports there is a high risk of disseminating respiratory infections most respiratory infections are easily transmitted but they have an incubation period of several days during which they are most contagious345the world has learned from the recent emerging infectious diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 highly pathogenic influenza a virus subtype h5n1 bird flu in 2005 and h1n1 influenza swine flu in 2009 about the need to cooperate in developing better surveillance and control measures public health authorities should give priority to the improvement of the awareness of the public on infection control measures the world health organization requires countries to report all new cases of emerging infectious diseases according to the international health regulations1 these global measures help countries to assess and increase their preparedness and readiness to the spread of infections6nonpharmaceutical interventions npis routinely recommended for mitigating respiratory infections include respiratory etiquette hand hygiene and routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces and objects effective use of npis depends on the acceptance and participation of individuals who implement personal protective measures and communities that implement communitywide measures7in a cross-sectional probable multistage sampling study of patients over 18 years 1600 participants 489 male were interviewed in mexico the authors concluded that there was a higher acceptance rate for the pandemic influenza vaccine with 906 willing to receive influenza a h1n1 vaccine compared to similar studies in other countries the main reason given by 465 of participants for rejecting the vaccine was distrust however 34 had previously received the seasonal flu vaccine furthermore 68 considered influenza a h1n1 a risk to their families the researchers reported that handwashing was the most common measure of infection prevention reported by 475 followed by the influenza vaccine 28 the level of education and age significantly influenced their objection to the vaccine8a descriptive analysis of a telephone survey was conducted in spain on 1627 participants 516 women 665 aged between 18 and 55 years 527 unskilled manual workers and 491 lived in cities larger than 50000 inhabitants respondents perceptions preventive measures vaccination related to influenza h1n1 were investigated only 157 felt that they were at risk of contracting influenza however in the second wave of this study after the epidemic peak the proportion of those who felt they were at risk of contracting influenza was much lower at 39 it was found that the main measures adopted were those recommended by the government9on the mississippi gulf coast when 216 residents were interviewed for the primary sources of their information during the 2009 influenza pandemic most participants 98 were aware of h1n1 influenza the most frequent sources of information cited were television tv 69 newspapers 19 and the internet 9 the preventive measure most adopted was hand hygiene 41 and that increased following the confirmation of the first influenza case10in a literature review based on the health belief model perceived susceptibility was the most significant factor that determined compliance moreover perceived benefit of mask wearing was found to have a significant effect on compliance as well experience or perception of discomfort and sense of embarrassment were perceived barriers to the wearing of masks11when elementary schools household caregivers students and their teachers were asked to participate in a survey the npi measures appeared to be high 90 among teachers and the caregivers it is essential to communicate the necessary information to the household caregivers and teachers through trusted sources12in a cross-sectional study of 340 inhabitants in florida blanca the best-known preventative actions were handwashing and use of surgical masks gender was associated with varying levels of knowledge while the awareness of preventative action was associated with exposure to the media educational attainment was related to symptom control measures and age was associated with the duration of handwashing and the use of quarantine13another cross-sectional study involving face-to-face interviews of 221 respondents in tampin negeri sembilan reported that 889 and 858 respectively indicated that they covered their mouths when coughing and sneezing with tissue paper or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing 912 and 889 respectively turned their faces away the previous respondents disposed of their used paper tissues properly in a waste bin and 912 claimed that they did not spit in public areas the vast majority used water and soap to wash their hands before eating 938 and after using the lavatory 987 however 819 washed their hands if they covered their noses and mouths when they sneezed only 358 of the interviewees claimed to follow the handwashing steps given by the ministry of health the use of face masks was moderate with 765 of the respondents using face mask during a pandemic furthermore 752 ensured that their face masks were properly fitted and covered their mouths and noses about 743 wore the ministry of health recommended face masks during the pandemic slightly more than half of the respondents 540 used face masks when they had influenza-like symptoms and 403 admitted to reusing their face masks more than once respondents practices on social distancing were appropriate those who avoided going to or taking their children unnecessarily to such crowded places as shopping areas were 889 and 832 respectively only 646 practiced safety measures such as the wearing of face masks in crowded areas and 301 used hand sanitizers when necessary as for self-health care the majority 792 avoided sharing forks and spoons with friends during a meal only 372 of the respondents took the initiative to look for additional information on influenza a h1n1 other than what was given by the government about a third of the respondents took food supplements during the pandemic phase a high percentage 686 of the respondents did not wash their hands after shaking hands with other people ethnicity education income and practice score predicted the knowledge score income and knowledge scores were predictors of practice score there was a positive correlation between knowledge and practice scores14in saudi arabia of the 1548 adult participants who were interviewed in various shopping malls in riyadh and jeddah 543 were very concerned while 608 had taken minimal or no precautionary measures educational level was the only significant predictor of the degree of concern participants who were male older better educated and more knowledgeable took more precautions than others the ministry of health reports of the characteristics of the disease were not enough to convince 383 of participants and only 161 of the participants reported receiving information from health providers frequent handwashing and face mask use in crowded areas were practiced by 577 and 562 respectively moreover 366 avoided touching their eyes noses or mouths and 380 covered their mouths and noses when sneezing or coughing used tissues were disposed of in a bin after use by 269 while 257 claimed that they avoided normal activities if they had flu-like symptoms15the objective of the present study was to measure the level of community compliance and practice of the measures for the prevention of respiratory infections and to identify the source of information of the measures for the prevention of respiratory infectionsan observational quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted in july 2014 in the five biggest shopping malls in each of the five geographic areas of riyadh the study participants were selected from these five malls the inclusion criteria were persons older than 15 years and arabic speakersthe questionnaire which was prepared in arabic by the authors had three main parts
sociodemographic including age gender employment status and the educational levels of participantsassessment of the degree of public compliance and practice regarding preventive measures against respiratory infections1 was tested using a predesigned face-to-face interview questionnaire with close-ended answers yesno to question on participants perception of susceptibility to respiratory infections and the use of masks for preventing respiratory infection the questions were do you think you are susceptible to contracting any respiratory infection which type of mask do you wear in crowded places which type of mask do you wear in your daily life which type of mask do you wear around infected people
likert scale always  5 often  4 sometimes  3 rarely  2 and never  1 was used to illustrate the questions on participants practices do you wash your hands with water and soap constantlydo you wash your hands with water and soap before eating are you keen on using antibacterial soap do you avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth directly with your handsdo you cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough with tissue paper and dispose of it in the bin if you do not have any tissue do you use your elbow when you sneeze or coughdo you avoid crowded places do you wear a mask in crowded places do you wear a mask in your daily life do you avoid people with respiratory infectionsif you are around infected people do you wear mask do you take the seasonal flu vaccinewhich type of mask do you wear in crowded places which type of mask do you wear in your daily life which type of mask do you wear around infected peoplethis scoring system was reversed in the case of questions do you share your personal stuff with others like towels do you share your personal stuff with others like utensils the total score from the 14 statements on practice for preventing respiratory infections was categorized into two as good median score and above and bad below median score practices
3populations source of information about the measures for the prevention of respiratory infections
the study instrument was reviewed by two family physicians one infectious disease consultant one community professor and one biostatistician all the above reviewers were academic staffa pilot study was conducted on 50 patients to check the applicability clarity and cultural appropriateness and to estimate the time required to complete the questionnaire the questionnaires took approximately 1520 min to complete those who participated in the pilot study were excluded from the main study assumingt 50 of persons were compliant and practiced the measures of prevention of respiratory infections with  7 precision and 95 confidence level the required sample size was 980 and 196 persons to be included from each of the five mallsethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board and informed written consent was obtained from all the participants the participants provided their information in strictly anonymous and confidential mannerdata were analyzed using spss pc version 210 statistical software ibm ny usa frequencies and percentages were used to describe categorical data and outcome variables pearson chi-square test and odds ratios were used to determine the association between independent variables and outcome variables binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with poor practice for the prevention of respiratory infection p  005 and 95 confidence intervals were used to report the statistical significance of the resultsout of 980 registered study participants 869 905 participated in this survey the age distribution indicated that 209 and 219 were in the 1520 and 2630 years age groups respectively while 54 were 45 years old overall 632 participants were female 467 had university level of education and 536 were employed table 1 about 483 of the participants thought that they were susceptible to any of the respiratory infections due to seasonal influenza 88 coronavirus infection 202 n1h1 36 and bird flu 54with regard to the participants practices 597 participants responded always washing hands with water and soap and 625 responded always washing of hands with water and soap before meals only 348 always used anti-bacterial soap and 298 reported always avoiding touching eyes nose and mouth with their hands about 635 reported always covering their noses and mouths with a tissue when they sneezed or coughed and disposed of it in a bin only 358 of them responded positively with always to the statement on using their elbow while they sneezed or coughed if they did not have a tissue paper about 71 and 490 reported never sharing their personal stuff towels and utensils with others respectively only 212 always avoided crowded places and 91 used masks in crowded places about 668 never wore masks in their daily lives moreover 45 avoided persons with respiratory infections overall only 386 always wore masks when in the presence of infected people and 628 did not take the seasonal flu vaccine furthermore a larger proportion of the participants used surgical masks or they do not know idk what to do while in crowded places in their daily lives and when infected persons were around table 2 and figure 1of all participants 497 had poor practices there was significant association between age groups gender educational level and occupation and the type of practice bad and good the unadjusted odds ratios for age groups 2125 2630 3135 3640 and 46 years gave significantly higher odds ratios 172 196 159 181 and 276 compared with the younger age group 1520 years with poor practice moreover being male showed a 140 times higher odds of having poor practice toward the prevention of respiratory infections compared with being female participants with no education had significantly higher odds of having poor practice compared with those with postgraduate education moreover the odds of having poor practice were considerably higher among retired persons employed and unemployed participants 743 258 and 213 compared with students the binary multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only low educational level and occupation other than being a student were significantly associated with the poor practice of preventing respiratory infections participants with no education intermediate education and secondary school level education had higher odds of poor practice compared with those with postgraduate education in comparison with being a student all unemployed employed and retired participants had higher odds of having poor practice for the prevention of respiratory infections table 3the multiple responses to sources of information about respiratory infections included electronic media tvradio from 479 of participants followed by social media whatsapp and twitter among 294 and 281 respectively and the least with friendsfamily doctors magazinenewspaper and campaigns figure 2table 4 shows a comparison of the practices of those who considered themselves susceptible to respiratory infections and those who did not the participants who perceived themselves susceptible to infections exhibit somewhat different preventive practices than their counterparts but the differences were not statistically significantthe behavior of the public is vital in the prevention of respiratory infections16 the present study illustrates perceptions on the prevention of infections and safety practices with regard to respiratory infections in a sample of the urban population of riyadhthe research findings reveal a high awareness of susceptibility to seasonal flu 88 but less susceptibility to coronavirus 202 n1h1 36 and bird flu 54 transmission this finding might be reasonable since seasonal influenza is well known in the community while the other flu types seem to be newly emerging communicable diseases the authorities recently initiated a public awareness campaign on the emerging flus as against the seasonal influenza which has existed for over a decadein our study 751 of participants had heard about flu earlier but this was lower than what had been reported in other studies this finding may be due to a lack of awareness and interest in health issues in our study population similar to studies done in china there were more female participants in the present study this finding may be because women are usually keener about health issues than men171819202122the majority of our participants were aware of the personal hygiene of hand washing following routine procedures and before eating a measure that is very effective in preventing the transmission of respiratory diseases however only a third used antibacterial soap which is less than found in previous studies this provides an opportunity for the adoption of the religious teaching of handwashing after using the lavatory and before eating23prophet mohammed peace be upon him always urged muslims to wash their hands before and after meals the lavatory touching a cadaver or ones shoes and handling anything soiled or suspect in any way24in this study 635 of the population always covered their noses and mouths when sneezing and coughing two of the main modes of transmission of respiratory diseases this finding is almost double what was reported in a previous study25in our study only 40 of the population used masks as a preventive measure in crowded places and only 20 used masks in daily lives which is much less than what was reported in a previous study25 in our study 321 of the participants avoided crowded places this is comparatively lower than the findings of the other study26 this may be the result of the lack of awareness of the preventive measures to be taken against the transmission of pandemic respiratory diseases in this survey only 137 had received the seasonal flu vaccine a large proportion 628 of the participants did not intend to take the vaccine their primary reasons were that they were unsure of the benefits and afraid of the adverse effects this poor attitude emphasized the importance of conveying appropriate messages to the public to make them understand better the benefits of the vaccine and improve its uptake moreover poor attitude has an impact on infection transmission therefore attitudes should be improved to prevent the spread of an outbreak this finding underpins the importance of awareness campaigns for frequenters of malls sports stadium and jummah prayers2526in the present study the majority knew about respiratory diseases similar to other studies almost half of the participants agreed that tv and radio are the most common sources of information the remaining participants obtained their information through whatsapp from the ministry of health doctors and through campaigns thus the findings suggest the urgent need for educational programs that can explicitly improve knowledge and behavioral practices in this group2728nilthere are no conflicts of interestthe cdc and world health organization instituted guidelines for routine infection prevention measures after the worldwide spread of the sars-cov-2 virus hcp are recommended to wear a simple surgical mask and perform regular hand washing when contacting low-risk individuals to protect against contamination hcps in high-risk areas should adhere to infection prevention and control practices which includes the appropriate use of engineering controls negative pressure rooms administrative controls and personal protective equipment ppe figures 13to minimize the risk of transmissibility and cross-infection the cdc has recommended airborne droplet and contact precautions this includes the mandatory use of ppe which includes gowns gloves face masks and either n-95 p100 or ffp2 respirators with a face shieldgoogles or powered air-purifying respirator papr to minimize the risk of transmissibility and cross-infection6 per cdc recommendations a clinically suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patient should wear a cloth face covering over nose and mouth and a surgical mask should be reserved for hcp and first responders6 unfortunately these ppe recommendations for both providers and patients will fail to prevent transmission if frequent surfaces decontamination enhanced hand hygiene and avoiding self-contamination are not carefully considered providers must focus on meticulous hand hygiene and disinfecting personal items such as stethoscopes phones id tags laptops dictation devices etc a route to minimize exposure and contact between triage to induction room or and then to recovery rooms should be frequently cleaned and disinfected it is recommended for an environmental services worker to increase the frequency to disinfect the most contaminated and most touched surfaces such as the elevator buttons door handles light switches grab rails and etc a recent study examined the most contaminated objects and ppe in the hospitals of wuhan china of the samples collected from hcp using ppe hand sanitizer dispensers gloves and protective eyewearfull-face shield 129 were positive for sars-cov-2 rna the highest rates of contamination were found on hand sanitizer dispensers gloves gogglesface-shields at a rate of 203 154 and 17 respectively7donning eye protection equipment is recommended because the inoculation of the conjunctival mucous membrane is a mode of transmission89 our recommendations for using protective eyewear are the followingprioritize eye protection equipment for certain selected surgical procedures ie during aerosol-generating procedures splashes sprays etc and where there is prolonged face-to-face or close contact with a suspected or confirmed covid-19 patientsfull-face shield if available or goggles can be issued to each providerconsider using safety goggles with extensions to cover the sides of eyesconsider using disposable prescription eyewear shields for those who wear prescribed glassesduring supply shortage use eye protection equipment beyond the manufacturer-designated expiration dateduring supply shortage follow and adhere to the manufacturer instructions for reuse and disinfection if these instructions are not provided consider the cdc recommendations10association of the advancement of medical instrumentation aami ratings are based on the level of fluid protection in the critical zone or chest region of the surgical gown the aami level should be checked on the packaging because they may come in several different designs materials and colorsnonsterile disposable or reusable-aami level-ii gowns frequently seen as disposable isolation gowns are appropriate for use by providers during routine covid-19 patient caresurgical gowns aami-level-iii typically those found in operating rooms or coveralls should be prioritized for surgical and aerosolized blood-generating procedurestable 1 provides our recommendation in this regard based on different settings and activitiesdouble gloves are recommended when handling covid-19 patients as an extra precaution to minimize contaminating ors items equipment and surfaces the outer pair should be pulled off before touching equipment or surfaces in other areas of or11surgical cap should be used per routine protocolssurgical hood with ties can be used for head and neck covering during aerosol-generating procedurescovid-19 is presumed to spread directly via infectious respiratory droplets and close contact because sars-cov-2 cannot survive without a carrier12 however these transmission modes do not explain all cases recent data have shown that covid-19 might survive and be transmitted indirectly from virus contamination of common surfaces and objects after virus aerosolization in a confined space with by infected individuals12 the incubation period for covid-19 is approximately 4 days and studies suggest that it may range anywhere from 2 to 14 days13-15 a recent study investigating sars-cov-2 from clinical specimens found that rna virus detected in blood samples from confirmed covid-19 patients 3 of 307 116 huang et al17 reported that 15 of patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 had viral rna in their plasma the implications of these findings are still unclear and there are no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronaviruses through april 5 2020 however continued vigilance is essential despite studies detecting viral rna in the serum or plasma of confirmedsuspected covid-19 patients blood transmission and infectivity are still not fully understood because there is little evidence and vague guidelines for blood transfusion in the current setting it is recommended to recuse anyone with symptoms or signs of respiratory illness from blood donation18 the us fda has suggested to retrieve and quarantine any blood products collected in the 28 days before or after either covid-19 disease onset or possible exposure to individuals who are covid-19 positive18 theoretically viremia in patients with asymptomatic or confirmed covid-19 patients could pose a risk of transmissibility to the orthopaedic team during aerosolized blood-generating procedures19 the use of high-speed drills bone saws reamers electrocautery and ultrasonic scalpels generate significant amounts of aerosols increasing the risk of viral contamination of the environment20 a recent canadian study described low-fidelity simulation training to evolve the modified ppe used for aerosol-generating procedures of suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patients and assess the sites of contamination21 the spread of the aerosolized respiratory secretions and contamination sites were visualized with a commercial powder product and ultraviolet light they demonstrated a significant amount of contamination on the providers neck base of the wrist and their lower pants and shoes these sites however are probably not associated with a direct method of transmission for sars-cov-2 however there are definite sources of self-contamination during ppe doffing in addition the disposable aami level-iii fluid-resistant surgical gowns or coveralls are recommended because they detected no contamination of scrubs beneath the surgical gown compared with reusable surgical gowns aami level-ii the aami level-ii gowns were permeable to aerosolized secretions the recommended ppe for performing respiratory aerosol or aerosolized

blood-generating procedure is very prudentduring the initial phase of us cases of covid-19 one washington state hospital reported that staff changed their ppe 20 times per shift23 many engineering and administrative measures should be considered especially if the current pandemic becomes prolonged these measures aim to mitigate the anticipated risk of global shortage of ppes such as surgical mask n-95 mask gowns etc extended use or limited reuse are applicable alternatives to prevent the anticipated supply shortage of face masks respirators and protective eyewear equipment and to ensure that healthcare staff have secured access to the necessary supplies for patient care limited ppe reuse refers to the practice of using the same n-95 mask for multiple encounters with patients removing it between encounters and doffing to ensure proper fit and the absence of gross contamination in the operative setting this may be done by wearing consider placing a simple surgical mask over the n-95 for preventing gross contamination n-95 respirator and change it between encounters reuse of protective eyewears such as full-face shields and goggles will be allowed if these are individually assigned to each member and regularly get disinfected reuse practice is permitted for a single person use no-sharing reuse and reprocessing of the n-95 mask guidelines have been released by the cdc and include the use of ultraviolet light processing hydrogen peroxide in either liquid or vaporized state and moist heating decontamination24 these guidelines should be reviewed at length before attempting reprocessing of equipment to prevent potentially catastrophic error extended use refers to the practice of using the same respirators for repeated close contact encounters with multiple patients without doffing it between the encounters this practice might be preferred over reuse assuming this would reduce the risk of self-contamination through frequent donning and doffing of the same equipment these practices vary between institutions especially for using n-95 masks theoretically the hcp could extend this and tolerate wearing n-95 masks for up to 8 to 12 hours2526 however most providers usually take breaks during shifts for lunchtoilets therefore extended use beyond 4 hours might be impractical in most settings27 although limited reuse practice could be adopted with negative or low-risk patients28within crisis situations and high-risk environments especially at crowded triage and ed rigor in following the designed and recommended measures for all hcp and patients is crucial29ask patients to wear a cloth face covering a scarf or bandana or face mask on the patient regardless of the covid-19 test results at arrival promoting cough etiquette and providing tissues and for hand hygienesuspected or confirmed covid-19 patients should be in negative pressure rooms if patients are coughing or procedures that create aerosols are being done if negative pressure rooms are available orclinically suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patients should separately triaged with at least 6-feet distance from other patients or nontreating staffsurgeons should not approach the triage

surgical team and for the patients with symptoms of respiratory infectionif the patient is oriented with moderate gsc score ask for the clinical and epidemiological criteria of covid-19 the presence of symptoms of a respiratory infection fever and or contact with possible covid-19 patientsit is preferred if possible to order immediate sars-cov-2 rt-pcr assay if patient is being admitted and especially before surgery and possible intubationpatient with noninjured face andor upper respiratory tract should wear a surgical face mask and be moved along a designated route with a minimal contact with others as much as possibleonly selected equipment and assessment tools should be brought into the triage room to minimize the number of items that need to be disinfected after the exposurethe main principles of the staff segregation physical restructure and the designed workflow should focus on reducing exposure and contamination ensuring adherence to ppe and subsequent decontamination ideally two types of hospital segregation should be done location-based segregation of orthopaedic staff reduces the potential risk of cross-infection orthopaedic surgeons for example should not be performing screening examinations on the general public because of the risk of exposure geographic segregation within the or complex limits the or traffic decreases the exposure and minimizes the contamination zone30 with the rapid increase in the number of covid-19 patients orthopaedic staff should be segregated into those who are treating suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patients and those who are treating noninfective patients when possible is not this however may not be possible in smaller hospital systems and practices besides screening and isolation of high-risk confirmed covid-19 patients strict and frequent screening of the segregated or staff is mandatory members of the segregated or exposed staff should immediately report any signs of illness and must be taken off duty immediately in addition all contact events between patients and staff must be recorded so that contact tracing and infection control measures can be implemented quickly in case any member of segregated staff tested positivesars-cov-2 test should be considered in high-risk individuals preferably before surgery and before intubation if possible2831-33signs must be placed at induction and or doors to alert other staff not to access the dedicated unit without donning the appropriate ppethe most experienced anesthesiologist should intubate the patients the rationale behind this recommendation is to make competent induction attempt in the shortest possible time without compromising the infection control measures or the staffs safetytry to minimize the airway manipulation face

use rapid sequence induction if it cannot be avoided administrate small tidal volumesuse deep anesthesia and neuromuscular blockagepreoxygenation should be done via a well-fitting face mask to avoid hypoxia in critically ill covid-19 patients with respiratory failureadministrate antiemetics to reduce post-op retching and vomiting that would require the mask removaluse a rigid suction catheter instead of a soft flexible one reduce contaminationthe patient should recover within the or when possibleit is a system-saving necessary act to plan and restructure our surgical care pathways and protocol during covid-19 pandemic to protect our community and patients and conserve our valuable resources the restructure should mainly focus on developing a reasonable plan for operating on emergent and urgent cases dedicating a covid-19 pre- intra- and post-operating spaces and training the administrative and surgical staff on the appropriate use of ppe and covid-19 care pathways to the best of a hospitals ability minimizes exposure and contaminationif there is suspected covid-19 diagnosis the surgical planning should be re-evaluated immediatelyprepare and set up a separate isolated or with separate ventilation system in case of confirmed covid-19 casededicated ors should have a separate atmospheric air inlet and outlet exhaust system recent studies highlighted the necessity to isolate and operate on suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patients within negative pressure orisolation room to disseminate the viral load21222832 however heating ventilation and air conditioning system in most of the us operating rooms is designed to provide positive pressure considering the current poorly controlled situation adding a portable self-contained high efficiency particulate air filtration system to the hospital heating ventilation and air conditioning systems would economically create a negative pressure that meets the osha and cdc tb guidelines34when possible entry to the or must be

should be disinfected separately followed by proper labelingpostoperative management is a crucial phase for clinically suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patients trauma infection and oncologic surgeries may be associated with slow recovery lengthier hospital stays and more complications after surgery the patients immune system may be compromised and there may be lower respiratory tract andor wound infections generally associated with fever in light of this information surgeons must be more vigilant to differentiate common postoperative complications from covid-19 infections in the presence of fever and one of the symptoms of a respiratory infection dry cough etc laboratory tests for covid-19 diagnosis must be ordered suspected cases should be reported immediately and under the premise of ensuring the safety of patient transportation to an isolation ward surgeons nurses and medical staff share an equal responsibility for the postoperative management particularly in monitoring the patients families and visitors to ensure the strict adherence to the pandemic emergency system when possible it is important to limit the visitors as much as possible in fact most hospitals have recently discontinued visitation by anyone postoperatively patients should receive adequate nutrition fluid hydration and electrolyte balance to promote immune recovery and rapid rehabilitation frequent monitoring of temperature laboratory cbc counts c-reactive protein ferritin level should be done in any patient with suspected covid-19 there is recent evidence suggesting that a subgroup of severe covid-19 might cause a cytokine storm syndrome which is an under-recognized hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia with multiorgan failure3637 an increased level of ferritin occurs in approximately 50 of patients all patients with severe covid-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation markers such as increased ferritin decreased platelet count increased ldh or crp36one of potential consequences and systemic changes of dealing with the covid-19 pandemic is the adoption and wide utilization of telemedicine in the surgical care of clinically suspectedconfirmed covid-19 patients over the past couple of months the traditional clinics or postoperative follow-up visits have been replaced with telemedicine modalities telemedicine could act as a virtual postoperative ppe to provide impeccable social distancing for patients safety and for all hcps so critically needed in frontline against the pandemic orthopaedic surgeons can use telemedicine postoperatively to follow-up with covid-19 patients in three manners38 to schedule follow-up39404142 for routine monitoring43-45 and management of recovery issues as needed46-48 in addition the use of telemedicine-based services for surgical wound care has proven to be feasible and safe in the early postoperative evaluation4950 both time and cost savings contribute toward high patient satisfaction39 a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that there was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and face-to-face follow-up visits in an orthopaedic trauma cohort41 another study after total joint arthroplasty showed that telemedicine significantly reduce the cycle appointment time with an average skype follow-up call per patient that was 271 minutes shorter than face-to-face visits42 research showed that for every 23 miles away from clinic there is 111 probability that a patient will more likely prefer using telemedicine for their postoperative follow-up48 surgeons form different specialties have expressed their satisfaction after using these telemedicine modalities to deliver postoperative care44485051 notably telemedicine revealed high levels of provider-perceived quality of medical history 82 and therapeutic management 85 compared with traditional face-to-face visits 72 and 86 respectively5253 preparation practice and following telemedicine start-up checklists would be useful to ensure effective implementation of telemedicine5455 the current focus should be directed in evolving more secured modalities to protect

prepared trained or equipped to mitigate the risk orthopaedic educators should educate their fellows residents students and ancillary teams in preventing exposure to and the spreading of covid-19 the care teams must learn how to protect themselves during a pandemic refresher training regarding the standard use of ppe is a necessity in this global pandemic a recent study at the university of illinois chicago56 assessed the ppe doffing practices of healthcare workers the study demonstrated that 90 of observed ppe doffing was incorrect regarding the doffing sequence doffing technique or use of appropriate ppe56 another survey showed that 149 of healthcare personnel did not receive previous training for appropriate ppe doffing practices57 training and education might flatten the curve of cross-infection and self-contamination training and education of the surgical staff should be continually emphasized it is imperative that all staff be taught the proper sequential methods of donning and doffing of ppe and mask-fitting techniques to minimize the risk of self-contamination frequent audits of infection control must be conducted a trained observer should be assigned for each emergent operation to identify the weaknesses and implement the necessary stepssimulation-based training might be required to improve the team communication during medical crisis58 to establish competencies in ppe donning and doffing practices and workflow in induction operating and recovery rooms simulation can mimic different clinical scenarios to integrate knowledge to practice evaluate the providers performances and build up self- and team-confidence for real-life cases lockhart et al21 demonstrated that simulation was a powerful tool to test and adapt ppe as compared to baseline recommendations alone using simulation-based training could be an effective method to replicate highly contiguous covid-19 cases in a safe yet challenging situation without jeopardizing the team safetycovid-19 is a major and sudden public health crisis followed by a series of emergency response measures for community and healthcare services the uncertainty of understanding the pandemic behavior and the definitive ways for its prevention cause psychological pressures on both the public and hcps the public panic and fear of getting infected can increase the burden and use of healthcare services the surgeons should be fully aware of the psychological pressure on the patients and their families the knowledge counseling education and support may mitigate the psychological pressure in fighting the pandemicapart from the fact that this pandemic certainly involves many important health economic and community ramifications it also requires several initiatives to mandate what measures are most appropriate to prepare for mitigating the occupational risks these initiatives include understanding the different aspects in disease and transmission control in the ongoing pandemic strict adherence to cdc and world health organization evidence-based guidelines for ppe and environmental hygiene enhances the safety and improves the mitigation of infection in emergent orthopaedic practice nevertheless we think that these recommended measures might optimize the healthcare services provided to confirmed covid-19 patients and should reduce the risk of occupational transmission to other patients and healthcare professionalsglobal supply chains have suddenly become a new buzzword in public consciousness the novel coronavirus global pandemic of 2020 has focused attention on supply chain shortages of personal protective equipment ppe and the testing kits used in the treatment and diagnosis of mushrooming numbers of covid-19 patients around the world the rapid shutdown of the

and foreign investment regimes the multilateral architecture of the postwar bretton woods system is crumbling and some question whether we have arrived at the end of globalization buruma 2016 farrell  newman 2020while global supply chains emerge as a protagonist in many of these scenarios the drivers and policy implications of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic are often unclear in large part this is because supply chain dynamics vary considerably not just by industry but also by the characteristics of specific products the strategies of the companies that make them and the distribution channels involved cattaneo gereffi  staritz 2010 staritz gereffi  cattaneo 2011 in addition the policy drivers of supply chains are different in importing versus exporting economies advanced industrial versus developing nations and the home and host countries of the large multinational enterprises mnes that typically lead and orchestrate global industries taglioni  winkler 2016 stolzenburg taglioni  winkler 2019 horner  alford 2019the covid-19 pandemic has rapidly become one of the most significant disruptive events in modern times it is simultaneously a public health crisis of unparalleled magnitude scope and speed that has circled the globe in a span of several months since the novel coronavirus outbreak in wuhan china was officially confirmed in early january 2020 medical news today 2020 there were over 128 million cases of covid-19 and 567000 reported deaths as of july 11 20201 the impact on the global economy has been equally draconian covid-19 has shuttered most of the worlds major economies for months as national governments have sought to weather the global pandemic with its disastrous and escalating toll on global trade and production skyrocketing spikes in unemployment2 and a soaring public debt due to massive stimulus packages designed to shore up moribund economies and stave off economic collapse3obviously no single country can be expected to efficiently produce all of the goods needed to fight the covid-19 pandemic however there are growing national security concerns related to acute shortages of medical supplies and other products in high demand to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus a key question related to international business and public policy is whether these current shortages in covid-19 medical products are due to structural flaws or rigidities in their supply chains as numerous critics have alleged and whether and how supply chains could be made more resilient or antifragile to confront new threats farrell  newman 2020 oleary 2020 oneil 2020 shih 2020 financial times 2020 avishai 2020 more specifically were the international trading system and global organization of production for covid-19 goods skewed to favor the interests of a small set of countries and firms that were the primary beneficiaries of globalized supply chains for these medical products is economic protectionism and the reshoring of production for essential medical supplies a likely and desirable consequence for future pandemics or major disruptions in the global economyto better comprehend these complex issues this article will cover four related topics first i will briefly outline the global value chain gvc research framework and indicate how its focus on patterns of governance and corporate strategies in global industries provides a key context in which the options and tradeoffs for national policymakers and other stakeholders can be evaluated second i will highlight the trade interdependencies for two categories of essential medical goods prior to the onset of the covid-19 pandemic the ppe used by medical staff in treating coronavirus patients such as face masks surgical gloves and medical gowns and medical devices covering more sophisticated equipment like life-saving mechanical ventilators patient monitors and x-ray machines third i will zero in on the case of face masks and n95 respirators in the us in which well-publicized shortages raise critical questions about the contentious interplay between policymakers in the current us administration of president donald trump and company strategies of leading american manufacturers that created prolonged supply shortages and distribution bottlenecks that greatly elevated the health risks for medical personnel and patients alike fourth and finally i will discuss some implications of the ppe case for more resilient supply chains and post-crisis policymaking in the futureduring the 1990s2010s an extensive literature has emerged that chronicles the growth of the global economy in terms of the decisions of major us and european companies to move production offshore and establish cross-border production networks known by various labels global commodity chains gereffi  korzeniewicz 1994 bair 2009 global production networks henderson dicken hess coe  yeung 2002 coe  yeung 2015 and gvcs gereffi  kaplinsky 2001 gereffi 2018 2019 a distinguishing feature of these studies is that they offer a network-centered perspective on the global economy that views different types of mnes as lead firms that orchestrate complex multi-tiered global supply chains these global networks leveraged the advantages of lower costs superior scale and spatial flexibility by combining a variety of factors proximity to natural resources access to large pools of low-cost and well-trained labor the increasing speed and sophistication of global logistics providers and the innovation design and marketing prowess of mne lead firms in a diverse array of agricultural manufacturing and service sectors see dicken 2015 low  pasadilla 2016 ponte gereffi  raj-reichert 2019the gvc approach has spawned a proliferation of review articles that highlight the complementarity of scholarship on gvcs global strategy and international business including the evolving capabilities of mne lead firms and domestic suppliers hernandez  pedersen 2017

of national and regional economies and the micro-level of local suppliers communities and workers the gvc framework includes several critical features relevant to our analysis of the supply chains for covid-19 goodsglobal industries have governance structures the strategies of gvc lead firms set the performance requirements eg price quality standards delivery schedule for globally dispersed tiers of suppliers a core insight of the early gvc literature was the contrast between producer-driven chains whose lead firms were multinational manufacturers in relatively technology- and capital-intensive industries such as automobiles computers and pharmaceuticals and buyer-driven chains whose lead firms were retailers such as jc penney walmart and carrefour branded merchandisers eg nike adidas liz claiborne or disney and supermarkets eg tesco and kroger gereffi 1994 subsequently a more elaborate fivefold governance typology was introduced that included hierarchies vertically integrated firms whose affiliates are bound by equity ties and competitive markets as endpoints along with three types of recurrent production networks  captive relational and modular  with varied levels of explicit coordination between lead firms and their suppliers gereffi humphrey  sturgeon 2005 sturgeon 2009global supply chains have specialized divisions of labor different locations make specific components and final products which increases the efficiency of the chain however disruptions or substandard products at one location can jeopardize the entire chain if sourcing options are not diversified sturgeon van biesebroeck  gereffi 2008 buckley  strange 2015 sun  grimes 2018the geography of supply chains can vary over time this is based on multiple factors eg country conditions company strategies technology shifts or government policies but regional and global sourcing patterns coexist and are often complimentary in many industries gereffi 1999 dicken 2015 whittaker sturgeon okita  zhu 2020 gereffi  wu 2020value is distributed unevenly across supply chains relatively high-value activities4 are increasingly located in specialized components within the production process

mudambi 2008 rehnberg  ponte 2018 fernandez-stark  gereffi 2019state policies can exert conflicting pressures on lead firms as well as suppliers in value chains while the expansion of international production networks and export-oriented industrialization for developing economies was promoted by advanced industrial states and global financial institutions like the world bank and the international monetary fund from the 1980s through the early 2000s a series of events including the global recession of 20082009 the uschina trade war resurgent economic nationalism and the novel coronavirus health crisis of 2020 have magnified the prospects for policy conflicts in the current era wade 2018 horner  alford 2019 mayer  gereffi 2019together these propositions constitute interacting dimensions and building blocks of the holistic multi-level and actor-oriented gvc framework that can be used to assess opportunities for development and upgrading for both countries and firms linked to global industries gereffi 2018 ponte gereffi  raj-reichert 2019 the next section of this article draws on this approach to examine the extent of globalization and the nature of lead firms in several of the medical supply industries associated with the covid-19 pandemicbased on the broad gvc framework we can make a few preliminary assessments to characterize the status of medical supply trade prior to the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 typically medical supplies are producer-driven value chains involved in business-to-business transactions between their lead firms or top suppliers and institutional clients such as hospitals healthcare distributors and government agencies however company strategies within this producer-driven governance structure show meaningful variations reflecting the characteristics of the industry segments or niches in which the lead firms operatein the medical devices segment global trade is led by large vertically integrated mnes headquartered in advanced industrial economies with worldwide production facilities although a number of major medical-device export industries are situated in relatively large newly industrialized global manufacturing hubs such as mexico china and the republic of korea as well as smaller more specialized locations such as ireland costa rica singapore and new zealand5 the main suppliers in these settings are usually subsidiaries of mne lead firms from the innovative centers of medical device production such as the us germany switzerland the netherlands and the united kingdom oecd 2020bin the less technologically sophisticated ppe segment of medical supplies by contrast there is more external contracting by third-party suppliers even though regulatory oversight and certification are required for all factories that sell medical devices to major markets6 bamber fernandez-stark  taglioni 2020 thus there is more scope in ppe than medical devices for supplier-centered rather than lead-firm centric company strategies7 which expands the role of external contractors and large developing economy suppliers for ppe items like face masks medical gowns and surgical gloves see bamber fernandez-stark  taglioni 2020 fig 3in general booming international demand has driven the globalization of medical supplies and devices in recent decades among the many medical products that industry experts have identified as critical in the fight against covid-19 the us imported us22 billion of these goods from the world in 2019 before the outbreak of covid-198 the us imported about 5 billion 26 of these products from china which is the leading supplier of numerous items including ppe protective goggles thermometers and medical headwear however depending on the product the main foreign supplier for the american market is often not china the european union is the primary source of ct computed tomography systems hand sanitizers patient monitors x-ray equipment and breathing masks other leading exporters for specific products include mexico medical protective clothing catheters malaysia sterile gloves singapore ventilators oxygen masks south korea ultrasound systems and canada oxygen concentrators bown 2020 fig 3the top exporters of covid-19 goods are quite varied at the global level see figure 1 a look at the overall trade structure of covid-19 products reveals that the top five global exporters which together account for 50 of trade are germany 15 the us 11 switzerland 9 china 8 and ireland 7 the us represents 18 of global imports for covid-19 products followed by germany at just under 9 of the total while the us and germany tended to specialize in the production of medical devices china and malaysia are the most specialized in ppe goods oecd 2020b thus trade interdependencies rather than pronounced asymmetries characterized the exchange of covid-19 products prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020between 2008 and 2018 global trade in ppe and medical devices has more than doubled in value bamber fernandez-stark  taglioni 2020 the driver was a large increase in demand resulting from a rapidly aging population in both rich and middle-income countries increased expenditure on healthcare in the developing world and low tariffs that resulted in a plentiful supply of low-priced and high-quality goods while exports of medical goods from the advanced industrial economies increased by 45 since 2008 the non-traditional exporters grew twice as fast 100 see figures 2 and 3notwithstanding these pre-covid-19 growth trends in the ppe and medical device gvcs it seems obvious that the outbreak and global spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the first half of 2020 and the dramatic surge in demand as the number of infected patients soared were bound to create severe shortages of covid-19-related products in the countries hardest hit by the virus the diversity of established exporters for medical supplies meant that trade was in principle an option to help meet burgeoning demand however the trade war initiated by president trump against china in early 2018 imposed an additional cost due to the tariffs bown 2020 and the more serious and widespread problem of export controls emerged in the cascade of nearly 80 countries that introduced export prohibitions or temporary restrictions for covid-19 products by the end of april 2020 wto 2020thus the arena for action for many countries shifted from the international domain to domestic terrain to find some combination of national production plus imports required to confront the urgent shortfalls of covid-19 products to explore how supply chains responded to the major disruption posed by the coronavirus pandemic i focus in the next section on us efforts to deal with the shortages of a specific ppe product face masks and in particular the n95 respirator my central research question concerns the interplay of policy by the federal government under the current us administration and the private sector response and whether there is evidence that vulnerabilities in the face mask gvc were a primary cause for the supply difficulties unleashed by the covid-19 pandemicsurgical masks and n95 respirators are both used to prevent the spread of respiratory infections they provide different levels of protection based on the effectiveness of their filtering surgical masks are loose-fitting and designed to trap sprays and droplets from coughing and sneezing while n95 respirators fit more tightly and can also protect from far smaller airborne particles such as those associated with a virus both surgical masks and n95 respirators are disposable which explains their high and recurrent demand9under normal circumstances masks are basic products and relatively cheap10 however the manufacturing process involves several types of inputs and is relatively sophisticated which accounts for their different filtering properties as well as the limited number of companies that specialize in the higher-quality masks globally see oecd 2020a for fuller descriptions the basic input for surgical masks is polypropylene a polymer derived from petroleum oil and one of the most commonly produced plastics in the world polypropylene is melt-blown in order to obtain fibers of a small diameter in a random pattern that can trap small particles11 multiple layers of non-woven and textile fabrics are then assembled through ultrasonic welding into a minimum of three layers12 n95 respirators have a similar production process with a couple of extra steps for added protection involving higher-tech machines and increased production costs after the assembly stage testing is required to guarantee the quality of the masks which must be sterilized before packing and shippingthe main bottleneck in the face mask value chain in terms of inputs has been the non-woven fabric manufactured with polypropylene oecd 2020a 4 production of this non-woven fabric is quite widespread because it is used in baby diapers feminine hygiene products and disposable wipes as well as in the automotive and construction industries however the melt-blown non-woven is a specialized fabric made by a limited number of companies worldwide due to the high capital investment required for heavy machinery such as hoppers extruders and melt-spinning systems for this reason it has been difficult to quickly increase the supply of face masks during the covid-19 crisis or to find companies that can switch to this production process within a reasonable time and without substantial new investmentchina was the main producer of surgical masks at the start of the crisis accounting for approximately one-half of world production oecd 2020a 56 because china was the epicenter of the initial covid-19 outbreak however its production was insufficient to meet its own demand related to the pandemic and china imported a huge quantity of up to 2 billion masks during the crisis although china increased its mask production tenfold in just 2 months januarymarch 2020 it was estimated that global demand for surgical masks might be ten times higher than world production capacity prior to the covid-19 crisis oecd 2020a in this context us efforts to guarantee an adequate supply of surgical and n95 masks faced an uphill battle when covid-19 infections began their precipitous rise in the us in march 2020the us was hit hard by covid-19 in mid-march 2020 about 3 months after it first appeared in china although the first reported us case of the new coronavirus was detected in mid-january 2020 the trump administration minimized the seriousness of the outbreak for a full 2 months until social distancing began to be introduced in mid-march for an exponential pandemic like covid-19 even small differences in timing could impact many lives according to disease modelers at columbia university if the us had begun imposing social distancing measures just one week earlier than it did in mid-march about 36000 fewer people would have died in the coronavirus outbreak and had stay-at-home measures been in place on march 1 2020 2 weeks earlier than most people started staying home 83 of us deaths could have been avoided glanz  robertson 2020 pei kandula  shaman 2020there were multiple missteps by the current us administration that slowed down its response to the covid-19 pandemic in the critical weeks before president trump issued his first direct social distancing advisories on march 16 in a detailed documentary of us government decision-making related to the covid-19 pandemic frontline 2020 it is reported that president trumps first briefing on covid-19 by alex azar secretary of the department of health and human services hhs occurred on january 18 several weeks after troubling initial signals about the pandemic emerged from china on january 29 white house economic advisor peter navarro wrote trump a lengthy memo warning that there was a risk of a massive loss of life that could be caused by the pandemic and the following day restrictions were imposed on some flights to the us from china in an effort to quell the spread of the virusalthough hhs secretary azar announced on january 28 that the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc had developed a rapid diagnostic test for detection of the novel coronavirus by february 8 it was discovered that the cdc test kits for covid-19 were contaminated this disastrous news meant that lack of us testing capacity would become a major obstacle that hindered subsequent us efforts to limit the exponential spread of the disease this testing failure along with other controversies cost cdc its leadership role in directing the us response to covid-1913once the us government started to take covid-19 seriously it conducted estimates in march 2020 of how many n95 respirators  which block 95 of very small particles  would be needed monthly to protect us healthcare workers to fight the pandemic the results indicated that 290 million n95 masks would be required each month whereas projected supply by the two leading us producers of the masks 3m and honeywell together with smaller suppliers like moldex-metrix and prestige ameritech would generate only 80 million masks on a monthly basis far below the target amount see figure 4 this shortfall of nearly three-quarters of the required total would have to come from the output of existing firms or new entrants into this sector as well as imports that were exceptionally difficult to find because of export controls imposed by virtually all ppe-producing nations wto 2020the top us face mask producer by far is 3m a minnesota-based conglomerate that makes over 60000 different products and has 96000 employees around the world 3m 2019 derensis 2020 while all n95 masks filter at least 95 of airborne particles respirators are produced for both industrial mainly construction and medical use prior to the onset of the covid-19 pandemic only 5 million of the 35 million n95 masks that 3m produced a month were going to us healthcare workers whalen helderman  hamburger 20203ms major n95 production facilities are located in the us and china in early 2020 3m scaled up n95 supply in its factories in south dakota and nebraska as well as its respirator production site in china to run all of its global respirator plants 24 hours per day seven days per week in anticipation of higher demand from the covid-19 virus by early may 3m brought its us production of n95 masks to 95 million units per month14 and doubled its global output of respirators since january 2020 to 11 billion per year 400 million in the us the company expects to double its current capacity again to 2 billion respirators around the world by the end of 2020 whooley 2020 newmarker 2020apparently spurred by fox news host tucker carlsons segment on 3m that criticized the company for allegedly putting consumers in other countries before healthcare workers and local governments in the us derensis 2020 president trump issued an executive order on april 2 that invoked the defense production act dpa of 1950 to require 3m to cease its export of n95 masks the us government asserted that due to the coronavirus pandemic 3m must give priority to the american market and the federal emergency management agency fema was authorized to obtain as many n95 masks as it needed from the company3m pushed back it countered by saying that cutting off exports of us-made respirators to foreign countries could actually worsen the us situation by inviting retaliation from trade partners on whom the us relies for imports of varied forms of ppe this sentiment was echoed by canadian prime minister justin trudeau and other canadian political leaders who cautioned that their countrys relationship with the us is a two-way street that involves flows of both material inputs and healthcare workers from canada that support the provision of the us medical complex cecco and borger 2020 whalen 2020 whalen morris et al 2020peter navarro the white house supply chain coordinator was tasked with procuring face masks ventilators and other ppe products from american firms in the fight against the coronavirus navarro a staunch china critic advocated use of the dpa as a weapon against us companies seen as too reluctant to expand ppe and ventilator production in the us such as general motors and 3m when patriotic volunteerism or the invisible hand of the market isnt working said navarro you may need the visible foot of the dpa swanson 2020 the question is whether navarros aggressive tactics will help the us respond to its current crisis and strengthen american industry or whether the disruption of global supply chains will cut the us off from needed medicines and other supplieson april 6 2020 3m announced plans to import 1665 million additional respirators over the next three months primarily from its manufacturing facility in china to support healthcare workers in the us 3m 2020b this plan allowed 3m to continue sending us-produced n95 respirators to canada and latin america where 3m is the primary source of supplyhowever this agreement did not resolve an ongoing controversy within the white house about how to harness american mnes to relieve acute shortages of ppe materials as the number of covid-19 cases in the us began their steep exponential ascent within the medical products industry more generally there was also debate about the vulnerabilities of their overreliance on a cost-optimizing just-in-time jit business model that prioritized foreign-made products in low-cost locations with a focus on china and declining inventories to minimize operating costswhile the political jockeying between us administration officials and 3m garnered most of the headlines there are two other significant factors that slowed 3ms ability to substantially increase its supply of n95 masks to the us market the jit business model that prevails in the healthcare market and prioritizes lean production and low inventories across the supply chain and industry demands for liability waivers in shifting from industrial to medical n95 masks to combat the covid-19 pandemicthe steady expansion of globalization in recent decades has encouraged the adoption of lean production and jit supply chains that encourage manufacturers to reduce inventories as much as possible in order to lower operating costs and the amount of cash tied up in inventory in its 2019 annual report 3m heralded its reduced inventory in order to more fully implement its new global operating model that expanded cash flow by 10 compared to the preceding year increased operating margins by 22 and reduced inventory levels by 370 million 3m 2019 2 just as manufacturers prefer to carry less inventory to be more competitive many hospitals have also adopted jit purchasing of items such as n95 masks as a cost-saving mechanism whalen helderman  hamburger 2020because industrial and medical n95 masks are made according to different specifications they vary in design and fit and they are subject to different regulations thus the conversion from industrial use to medical masks is not straightforward as some retooling is required because medical masks contain an extra material that makes them splash-proof raising long-standing industry concerns about liability lawsuits whalen helderman  hamburger 2020in 3ms negotiations with the trump administration in early march for increasing the supply of n95 masks in the us the chief concern raised by 3m chief executive officer michael roman was the need for a liability waiver from congress to shield the company from potential lawsuits as it repurposed 3ms industrial masks for medical use the liability waiver was included in president trumps emergency legislation that opened the floodgates to the 2 trillion stimulus package that included funding to produce over 1 million n95 medical masks over the next 18 months whalen helderman  hamburger 2020viewed in isolation 3ms supply response of n95 masks to meet surging us demand for respirators seems woefully inadequate to the 329 million confirmed cases of covid-19 and 137000 reported deaths as of july 11 202015 with numbers continuing to soar however prestige ameritech the last major domestic mask company in the us approached senior administration officials on january 22 2020 a day after the first case of covid-19 was detected in the us offering to ramp up production of four unused n95 manufacturing lines to make an additional 17 million n95 masks per week davis 2020 the offer was rejected because the department of health and human services did not have the money to issue contracts at that time despite orders pouring into prestige from buyers in china and hong kong and shrinking domestic production of medical masks as almost 90 of all us mask production had left the country in less than a decadeby may 2020 fema had issued over 600 million in new contracts for n95 medical masks the biggest us suppliers 3m and honeywell were each awarded contracts for over 170 million for protective gear and other large orders went to untested third-party firms willing to enter the mask market at prices many times higher than the contracts for established producers prestige ameritech finally got a 95 million contract on april 6 to provide a million n95 masks per month for one year at a unit price of 79 cents per mask davis 2020on balance the shortage of n95 masks in the us covid-19 pandemic seems more like a case of policy failure than market failure 3m the biggest american producer more than quadrupled its us output of n95 masks in the first half of 2020 to 95 million per month by may and its global capacity was projected to double from 11 billion to 2 billion masks by the end of 2020 honeywell and other us companies were also poised to fill over 400 million in us orders this is a very significant expansion of us production capacity in less than 6 monthsthe bigger problem is one of policy failure by the current administration they did not appreciate the scale and the inevitability of the pandemic problem when the first us cases were reported in january 202016 and additional policy delays related to lack of testing bureaucratic in-fighting and unwillingness to confront the health risks posed by the looming pandemic wasted valuable time to further complicate its supply-side policy agenda the trump administration sought to nullify 3ms export contracts with overseas customers in canada and latin america raising deeper sovereignty concerns with us trading partners the result of these and other us policy shortcomings in confronting the epochal challenge of the coronavirus pandemic is that the us had a record number of new covid-19 cases in a single day on july 10 2020 with 68241 diagnoses reported a startling spike that more than tripled the total in mid-june 20114 new cases on june 15 new york times 2020our analysis of the impact of covid-19 on medical supplies gvcs reveals the need to view ppe and other medical products from an evolutionary and a strategic perspective supply chains not only became more global in recent decades but they also became increasingly dependent on key exporting economies like china along with the jit business model that was optimized to maintain low costs and reduced inventories while lower inventories may be viewed as an efficient business practice when orders are steady they make supply chains fragile and brittle in times of crisis to prevent modern supply chains from snapping redundancy rather than reshoring is recommended to bolster the robustness and resiliency of supply chains oleary 2020 oneil 2020in the context of the covid-19 pandemic what do resilient supply chains look like the search for resiliency encourages mne lead firms to diversify their supply chains in multiple ways in order to retain scale economies reasonable costs and innovation opportunities strategic options could include the following measures 1 bolster capacity in the home country to address security concerns for products deemed essential17 2 expand the number of international production sites to avoid overreliance or dependence on one or two locations18 3 seek large and growing end markets that can be served from an international production network19 and 4 nurture production research and marketing partnerships with firms in related industries20while policy interventions during a crisis seek short-run solutions what is the enduring legacy of the covid-19 crisis likely to be domestic production for many ppe products will surely increase but it is not clear which ppe products or components will be prioritized nor do we know what proportion of total supply of ppe items will come from local production versus imports while offshore production will continue to be a significant feature for the ppe sector regional supply chains or near-sourcing along with other preferred suppliers will be an important mechanism for diversifying risk in the futurechina in particular remains a critical strategic actor within the ppe supply chain not merely as a source of relatively low-cost exports but even more importantly because chinas healthcare market is the second largest in the world estimated at over 1 trillion in 2020 huang 2019 us medical products companies will view the china market as critical to their long-term international competitivenesstwo additional considerations are relevant in considering post-covid-19 scenarios for medical supplies first regulatory policies are crucial for all healthcare supply chains both in the home market such as the legal liability concern over n95 masks and also in the transparency of international supply chains where informal subcontracting has often compromised quality and lowered confidence in these arrangements however gvc studies highlight that regulations for the same products can vary in their stringency or levels of enforcement in large developing economies such as china which could promote or hinder upgrading among gvc suppliers kaplinsky terheggen  tijaja 2010second contingency plans for future crises will be essential black swan events are increasingly likely but their specific features remain unknown avishai 2020 thus we

the modern world is fast-evolving interconnected and highly mobile making risk governance based on the application of harmonised biorisk mitigation measures a significant challenge after the two zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov from 2002 to 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012 mers-cov another coronavirus has crossed species to infect human populations for the third time in the 21st century perlman 2020 this virus provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov further referred to as sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan china in early january 2020 after cell culture and isolation of the viral particle zhu et al 2020 lee et al 2020 as for sars-cov and mers-cov the primary reservoir of the covid-19 is probably the bat based on sequence similarity with bat coronaviruses presumably the intermediate animal hosts of 2019-ncov should be among the wildlife species sold at the huanan seafood wholesale market ye et al 2020 despite public health risk mitigation measures and regulation efforts by many countries regions and sectors the current covid-19 outbreak reminds the world about our vulnerability to natural and man-made chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn hazards and on the importance of mitigation actions
1emerging biological hazards may include pathogens in new settings due to climate change influencing the spread of vector-borne diseases arising from the melting arctic ice sutherstet al 2004 other examples are pathogens with zoonotic potential arising from intensive or inappropriate farming such as avian or swine flu mers or spill-over of pathogens from wildlife due to the continuous expansion of human territory such as sars ebola both bringing humans and potential animal vectors in closer contact with each other mills et al2010 these new agents may cause significant threats to human health if they display high infectivity with potentially high morbidity or even lethalityon january 30 2020 a panel of experts of the world health organisation who declared the outbreak of sars-cov2 causing the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic and on march 11 2020 the ongoing covid-19 outbreak was upscaled by the who to its 6th and highest alert scale as a pandemic who 2020for many years the risk of emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential was declared a major threat to global health security and addressed by many stakeholders around the world namely who global health security initiative ghsi 2001 nuclear threat initiative nti who have been very active recently in the bio field the european parliament various national or regional centres of disease control etc mccloskey et al 2014 the degree to which countries translated these warnings and recommendations on prevention preparedness and response capacity varies in many countries priorities were given to other domains and investments into appropriate and effective personal protective equipment ppe stocks in healthcare facilities and other first responder institutions were left behind papp et al 2020 according to these authors there is also a long lasting and ongoing trend in our societies to undermine scientific facts in the domain of public health and healthcare by non-evidence based opinions or purely economic considerations one recent example is the discussion about the safety of the vaccine against the 2009 swine flu outbreak when a great deal of mistrust and unfounded theories heavily influenced peoples willingness to be vaccinated cohen and enserink 2009 seale et al 2011 for example in scandinavia great scepticism towards vaccines undermined global vaccination campaigns eg the mumps measles rubella vaccine for children
2 due to our increasingly connected world especially in the last decade a lot of misinformation spreads through social media and is accessible to all leading to the politicisation of science deming 2005 jasanoff 2005 davies 2019 and the organisation of ignorance frickel and vincent 2007 knowles 2014 wieland 2017 this adds complexity to the interface between policy science and practice and underlines the importance of knowledge management and consistent sharing of best practice in the domain of risk mitigation daszak et al 2020the challenge to achieve sharing of best practices for risk mitigation during the current covid-19 pandemic is high koonin 2020 it requires mechanisms that build upon knowing how to evaluate plan implement and maintain risk mitigation measures along with appropriately deciding who to involve renn 2008 nucci et al 2017 making decisions about the chain of command and channelling communication communication and information sharing foster democratic learning across governments and sectors amongst varied stakeholders decision-makers scientists practitioners and citizens and between different levels of society international national regional and local tompkins et al 2008 these mechanisms are especially important when they are able to bring together different regions of the world in discussing and preparing for the different phases of a pandemic quickly understanding lessons learned and applying them in the regions that are going through the earlier steps of the process an excellent example of an existing mechanism is the european unions chemical biological radiological and nuclear risk mitigation centres of excellence initiative eu cbrn coe which was launched in 2010 to strengthen and structure the institutional capacity and country mechanisms outside the european union with regard to prevention preparedness and response of chemical biological radiological and nuclear risks this initiative addresses risks of criminal origin eg the sarin attack on the japanese subway okumura et al 1998 accidentally created eg bhopal broughton 2005 or naturally occurring eg swine flu outbreak covid-19 pandemic the eu cbrn coe is led financed and implemented by the european commission in close coordination with the european external action service eeas and with the support of the united nations interregional crime and justice research institute unicri and other international organisations and local experts the eu cbrn coe is active in 61 countries in eight regions each region hosting a regional secretariat and each country with a national focal point and a cbrn national team see figure 1
through activities led by the eu cbrn coe initiative many countries have elaborated cbrn national action plans notably against biological threats creating awareness and mechanisms
3 to structure prevention preparedness and response during disasters these plans include the establishment of a chain of command the identification of national stakeholders decision-making procedures enhanced inter-agency communication stockpiles of ppes medicines drills communication procedures etc over the last ten years 25 projects out of a total of 82 to date have focused on capacity building in the domains of biosafety and biosecurity including the identification of risk mitigation measures for biological disasters
4 with the help of the eu cbrn coe network the project outcomes are being activated for quick response to the spread of the virus by quickly compiling the experiences and by keeping in touch through the regional secretariats using virtual meeting tools other initiatives could take the same approach disseminating risk mitigation actions such as the ones compiled in the present paperby studying the literature media and national information channels in light of the current pandemic we have collated and clustered the risk mitigation measures taken around the globe first in the effort to contain and since march 11 2020 to mitigate the risks of covid-19 by limiting the spread of sars-cov-2 the objective is to make this clustering globally available and to harmonise its terminology so that governments and sectors gain valuable time to put adequate measures in place furthermore the intention of this paper is to highlight the importance of building trust by improving effective communication processes with cross-country and cross-sectoral information sharing enhancing the learning process edelman trust barometer 2020 and in turn enhancing risk governance mechanismsthree adult patients with severe pneumonia were admitted to a hospital in wuhan on december 27 2019 two of whom were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market zhu et al 2020 patients 1 and 3 recovered and were discharged from the hospital on january 16 2020 patient 2 died on january 9 2020 evidence for the presence of sars-cov-2 was found by the identification in bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid in the three patients by whole-genome sequencing direct pcr and culture zhu et al 2020 before the end of december 2019 still few people knew that this new virus existedas the infection spread within the city of wuhan local health workers alarmed local authorities and the outbreak got international attention via media coverage in early january local risk mitigation measures were implemented including the closure of the huanan seafood wholesale market at that time for the rest of the world especially outside asia business continued as usual and any risk perception was considered minimal on january 12 2020 china shared the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2
5 and on january 13 2020 the first case was reported outside china a patient in thailand reported to have visited the huanan seafood wholesale market
6 due to the absence of a cure or a vaccine controlling the infection to prevent the spread of covid-19 was correctly seen as the only intervention that could be used lai et al 2020 consequent risk mitigation measures were soon after announced in wuhan holiday extension city lockdown quarantine requirements lin et al 2020 and in neighbouring cities and regions other areas and countries such as hong kong taiwan south korea and mongolia followed with almost daily announcements of ever more strict risk mitigation measures to limit the spread these comprised of travel restrictions isolation of travellers coming from the wuhan region closure of schools and universities and the prescription of hygienic measures see the timeline of the events in figure 2
 on january 30 2020 the who emergency committee convened for a second time under the ihr2005 rules world health organisation 2008 and declared the outbreak as fulfilling the criteria for being a public health emergency of international concern pheic
7 at this time related discussions started in european countries but still dramatic measures such as locking down entire cities regions or countries was not considered kervorkian et al 2020 concern grew but no real changes occurred since the perception of the risk was still low and individual and group behaviour was not affected this status started to change when two regions in italy veneto and lombardy faced a rapid growth in the number of infected people forcing the italian authorities to lockdown the most affected villages first then the entire northern part of the country and finally the entire country other countries followed albeit with a one to two week delay at the time of writing the italian health care system is still fighting the crisis and remains on the brink of collapse experiencing innumerable numbers of hospitalised patients a scarcity of intensive care beds medical staff over 60 doctors in italy have died
8 ppes ventilators and medicines although in different degrees other countries are also experiencing similar challenges including spain and the united states
9looking at what seems to be the critical points in reaching an out-of-control situation in italy we note that while many italian first responders did their utmost to contain the virus many citizens in italy did not comply with restrictions at first and it took some time and multiple efforts of the authorities to communicate to the population why compliance with the restrictions was important it is believed that one of the critical moments of spread was the champions league football match played in the san siro stadium in milan on february 19 2020 where about 40000 football fans from bergamo  which became the hotspot in the northern region of italy in the following weeks - attended and afterwards filled up the bars and restaurants around the stadium
10 most strikingly while the northern regions already had many restrictions being most importantly self-quarantine socialphysical distancing hygienic measures and a lock down of the northern region the weekend of march 7-8 is believed to have caused the collapse of the respective regional health system in the weeks thereafter by coinciding with the celebration of the international womens day following italy other european countries were experiencing rapidly increasing numbers of covid-19 patients in the time after the spring break it is believed that many people became infected in alpine ski resorts during the spring break spreading the virus upon their return consequently as another mitigation measure european ski resorts were shut down
11many countries followed italy implementing risk mitigation measures starting from advisory to recommendable and finally enforceable measures interestingly though and similarly to the experience in italy the process of risk perception and the translation to compliance and trust in taking risk mitigation measures also took time in other countries edelman trust barometer 2020 at the likely cost of additional spread and contamination as health is a national responsibility in the eu not regulated by the european union many countries have applied different levels of risk mitigation measures and followed different communication strategies these ranged from the acceptance of a propagation in view of promoting group immunity mainly in the united kingdom the netherlands and sweden
12

13 to strategies to fully protecting all individuals mainly to prevent overwhelming the healthcare systems but also in the interest of awaiting the results from ongoing medical trials on treatments and studies about individual and group immunity kwok et al 2020 in an attempt to understand these fundamental differences the authors believe that this is related to the differences of the societal structure as seen in northern regions in europe and many parts of the us northern structure versus the southern european arab asian and latin world southern structure the northern structure is based on elderly people living in retirement homes similar to parts of the us and elderly living alone the southern structure is based on larger families living under the same roof and across multiple generations because inside retirement homes disease can rapidly spread due to the higher risk group leading to segmented high mortality numbers
14 retirement homes were locked down and the assumption may have been made that the elderly living alone may stand a better chance of not contracting the disease at allrisk mitigation is an interdisciplinary decision-making process based on information from risk and exposure assessment bruinen de bruin 2007 it entails consideration of political socioeconomic epidemiological mental health and engineering data to compile regulatory options and select the appropriate regulatory societal sector or company response to covid-19 at the time of writing many countries have taken risk mitigation measures and are trying to prepare for the future by looking at countries that are ahead in the course of the pandemic and learning from their experiences wu and mcgoogan 2020to better understand the underlying differences and to harmonise terminology the risk mitigation measures were clustered into various categories the categorisation along with the timeline of events are illustrated in figure 2reviewing the risk mitigation measures implemented by numerous countries the measures were clustered according to the following categories1
mobility restrictions these aim to limit the movement of people in order to contain or to slow down the spread of the virus it reduces the number of people who can be infected by both symptomatic and non-symptomatic uncontained cases gostic et al 2020 hellewell 2020 restrictions comprise active zoning closinglimiting public transportation air traffic restrictions or even temporary closure limiting use of private cars bicycles and outdoor activities such as walking some countries only allowed walking outside with a dog and running particularly in groups of more than two people2
socio-economic restrictions these target social and economic activities where people gather for educational recreational sportive or work-related purposes restrictions comprise the closure or limiting of schoolsnurserieschild-care and homes for the elderly closure of museums swimming pools bars and restaurants indoor and outdoor sport facilities and hotels suspension of retail trade save for essential goods including food medicines and their supply chains with banking financial and insurance services also belonging to this cluster additional examples are the promotionobligation of teleworking limitingcancellation of production in factories3
physical distancing these measures have also been referred to as social distancing in fact physical distancing is regarded as a more appropriate term to avoid social isolation especially of fragile groups such as the elderly given that with a proper distance currently defined between 15-2m it is still possible to be social it also embraces virtual social connections other examples entail the prohibition of groups larger than 2-3 persons closing public outdoor spaces parks benches beaches etc and imposing regulations in terms of entrances and number of people present per square meter required distance between humansoccupants in indoor spaces comprising offices meeting places and commercial spaces4
hygiene measures these aim to limit the risk of spreading the virus and direct or indirect contamination of others recommendations comprise washing hands for at least 20 seconds sneezing in elbow avoiding touching surfaces contactless payments avoid exchanging money wearing ppes such as masks eye and hand protections household waste disposal instructions preventing contact with contaminated infectious materials by waste collectors and waste processing operators worker protection in the places where physical distancing is not feasible eg placement of protective glass in supermarkets between cashier and customer precautionary and sickness driven quarantine family vs individual targeted symptomatic screening upon arrival or entrance such as obliged temperature check or large scale testing5
communication this cluster is in the authors view the most essential part of risk mitigation measures since it drives the public understanding trust acceptance and compliance with the measures especially in societies where large-scale disasters were absent for decades as is the case in many countries since wwii where mistrust in authorities prevail andor where individual freedom became the norm above caring for the group the communication of risk mitigation measures during a major crisis situation adds significant challenges in march 2020 a who whatsapp group was set up providing information and risk mitigation instructions related to categories 1-4 countries also launched national communication measures structured in news and information websitesplatforms jointly combatting fake news aiming to encourage awareness understanding and compliance towards restrictions6
international support mechanisms as the world is fighting the same threat and many countries are limited in their capacity and resources the importance of acting internationally is acknowledged as exemplified by the following actions countries sectors and companies increased global production and international exchange of ppes raw materials for pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical formulations basic medical drugs and ventilators existing risk mitigation networks were quickly activated and new transnational platforms are being set up for knowledge exchange on clinical trials treatments lessons learned and publications

at the time of writing increasing information is being generated about the experiences in mitigating covid-19 although it is difficult to precisely understand the effectiveness of each category of risk mitigation measure the currently available literature has been studied
mobility restrictions early analysis of the wuhan covid-19 outbreak suggest that the effects of travel limitations are important for national and international agencies dealing with public health response planning chinazzi et al 2020 showed that by january 23 2020 the epidemic had already spread to other cities within china and therefore the travel quarantine around wuhan had only modestly delayed the epidemic spread to other areas of china the wuhan travel ban was initially effective at reducing international case exportations but not to limit the already ongoing spread outside china most importantly this study showed that additional travel limitations up to 90 of the traffic has a modest effect unless paired with public health interventions and behavioural changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility in the communities as also confirmed during the sars outbreak in singapore drake et al 2003 these findings underline the importance of quick response based on proper early detection and epidemiological risk analysis in combination with the application of additional risk mitigation measures in addition disease experts estimate that each covid-19 patientcarrier infects between two to three others
16 each risk mitigation measure contributes to a decrease in new infections anderson et al 2020 in order for these restrictions to be effective it is believed that testing registering number of hospitalisations and deaths in the weeks after the restrictions are key to tracking the effectiveness of the measures at present the effectiveness of each measure cannot be quantitatively assessed however the authors of this paper believe in the application of the precautionary principle meaning that application of a combination of mitigation measures  even those without current clear scientific evidence such as school closures anderson et al 2020  is the best practice to gain most time in decreasing the rate of new infections hellewell et al 2020socio-economic restrictionsthe implementation of socio-economic restrictions occurred gradually within most countries and even up to date there are major differences between countries in terms of the closing down of public places the most plausible reason is that these restrictions are expected to impose a major impact on the functioning of the current economy and way of life a recent analysis of smartphone location data by the us search engine giant google showed that visits to shops parks or railway stations fell steeply in most european countries between february 16 and march 29 2020 as governments sought to slow the explosive spread of the covid-19 disease
17 reuters reported that in italy and spain retail and recreational trips were down by 94 physical presence in workplaces also decreased by over 60 in respective countries both italy and spain along with france imposed near lockdown of their states and by the time of writing the restrictions they have imposed are with a time lag starting to flatten the curve of new infections at least in some countries financial times april 4 2020 these latest findings add to the suggestion that the combination of different categories of risk mitigation measures contribute most successfully to the fastest decrease of new infections given the geographic scale and severity of covid-19
physical distancing individual behaviour is crucial in controlling the spread of covid-19 in early march 2020 anderson et al 2020 described that in western democracies personal action rather than government action might be the most important issue comprising of early self-isolation within one day from symptom onset seeking medical advice remotely unless symptoms are severe and physical distancing the same authors described the importance of the application of a combination of mitigation measures such as physical distancing in combination with the ban of mass gatherings good diagnostic facilities and remotely accessed health advice together with specialised treatment for people with severe covid-19 infections a combination of these measures was suggested to lead to a 60 reduction in transmission at the time of writing many western democracies also experienced the effects of the lack of awareness of a significant portion of the population leading to non-compliance with the recommended or obligatory restrictions as a result in the course of days governments increasingly implemented a combination of communication strategies outdoor signs use of social media drones informing the public in combination with enforcement strategies giving increasing fines to groups that were violating the ever more stringent restriction measures germany established on march 22 2020 a fine of up to 25000 euro for gathering in groups of more than 3 persons
18 the netherlands reported on march 27 2020 the arrest of an individual coughing in the face of a police officer while claiming to be infected with covid-19
19niu et al 2020 reported that transmission by people with mild or no symptoms can undermine the effectiveness of the isolation strategy because of reduced likelihood of isolating all cases and tracing all contacts the identification and testing of potential cases needs therefore to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacityincluding the identification testing and isolation of suspected cases with no or mild disease eg influenza-like illness in the fight against covid-19 early control measures such as isolation and contact tracing could gain more power thanks to modern technology the authors believe that detection combined with contact tracing should continue to be an important measure to control the outbreak
hygiene measures wild animals were slaughtered in the wuhan market increasing the risk of human exposure to blood and to other animal fluids with high risk of being exposed to wild animal viruses wet markets such as these are poorly viewed by many countries in the world who are now combatting the consequences of the outbreak however it should be borne in mind that similar wet markets exist in several other places around the world such as in africa asia and south america with cultural habits and behaviour being hard to change the authors believe the solution lies with the avoidance of mixing wild and domestic animals in indoor and outdoor spaces and prohibition of on-the-spot slaughtering of animals in markets due to very weak hygienic measures for many years already western countries have enforced the systematic use of slaughterhouses with very strict hygienic measures and authority control in a recent announcement chinese authorities temporarily prohibited these wild life markets as of march 2020
20 adding to the long list of risk mitigation measures currently being takenwho cdc ecdc and other internationaleuropean organisations have been drawing attention to the importance of hand hygiene for many years the who began drawing up guidelines in 2004 and have produced specific guidelines for hand hygiene in health care in 2009
21 and in general
22 apart from the six languages on the who site most countries have this information available in their official languagesthe message regarding use or not of face masks has been very unclear also internationally this lack of clarity has been compounded by the lack of suitable masks such as those meeting the technical specifications of ffp2 and ffp3 covered by regulation eu 2016425 on personal protective equipment moreover surgical masks which seem effective in clinical settings at reducing the risk of infection for professionals do not provide adequate protection during aerosol generating procedures agps therefore masks need to be used in combination with other ppe measures
23 smith et al 2016 long et al 2020 for the ecdc the use of face masks is of highest priority in healthcare workers but also in symptomatic confirmedsuspected cases of covid-19 and those caring for them instead who and others health authorities do not recommend the use of face mask for the general public
24 whether the recommendation by western countries us uk and the majority of eu that the public should not wear face masks is or not motivated by the need to preserve limited supplies for professional use in health-care settings is unclear in parts of asia china japan south korea singapore and recently in some eu countries czech republic and austria all citizens have been encouraged to wear face masks in public regardless of whether they have symptoms austria and italy have joined a small but growing number of european countries making the wearing of face masks outside the home compulsory amid shifting debate over the medical gears protective utility
25 authorities started distributing millions of free face masks at the entrances to all supermarkets from april 01 2020 in austria shoppers will only be permitted inside supermarkets and other open stores such as pharmacies if they are wearing masks italy made the outdoor wearing of masks or scarfs obligatory as of april 04 2020 ordinanza n521
26 according to research on the sars epidemic face masks surgical and ffp2n95 were an effective intervention for reducing the contraction and spread of the virus jefferson et al 2011 as evidence suggests that nearly half of sars-cov-2 transmissions occur before the infected person becomes symptomatic a consistent and proper use of face masks by the general population could offer a partial additional benefit to the other essential mitigation measures such as hand hygiene and isolation of infected people moreover universal use of face masks could prevent discrimination of individuals who wear masks when unwell because everybody is wearing a mask feng et al 2020 leung et al 2020 hence there is some rationale for mask-wearing in the general population even if there is evidence disputing this however during a pandemic from a new respiratory virus such as sars-cov-2 in the absence of specific and well-tested pharmaceutical interventions masks might well play a role in reducing transmission in particular when physical distancing is not possible this is probably why in the us the cdc is reportedly contemplating a change in guidancea recent ec communication commission recommendation eu 2020 403 13 march 2020
27 clarifies many questions including for eg those of critical service providers who will not be able to avail of government supplies destined for health workers under what conditions they may provide their employees with non-ce labelled masks assuming they can import their own supply also at european level one of the risk mitigation measures taken was the creation of a strategic resceu stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks to help eu countries in the context of the covid-19 pandemic
28 part of the stockpile will include items such as i intensive care medical equipment such as ventilators ii personal protective equipment such as reusable masks iii vaccines and therapeutics and iv laboratory supplies it remains to be seen how quickly the european member states will be able to avail of this stockpile
communication during the outbreak crisis it is key to have trustworthy and well-coordinated communication channels to create community trust and compliance hong kong singapore japan and south korea are among those that stabilised the cumulative number of cases within two to three weeks after the 100th case ft analysis of john hopkins university csse march 14 2020 these countries quickly applied a combination of risk mitigation measures such as school closures strict quarantine and isolation measures and contact tracing moreover data studied at the time of march 16 2020 suggests that a strong community response to the risk mitigation measures communicated by the authorities is key to stabilising the cumulative increase of the spread of covid-19 this demonstrates the importance of citizen awareness social trust in authorities and well-coordinated risk mitigation communication
international support mechanism avoiding an uncontrollable world pandemic requires the implementation of a global mechanism built and empowered to act at an unprecedented speed niud y and xu f 2020 as hellewell et al 2020 described the time window of early response is potentially extremely short signifying that once the number of initial cases increases to a few tenths 40 cases seems to be a critical number the probability of failure to control is high ie at 80 even if 80 of contacts are traced and isolated in this context global coordination is mandatory and help should be quickly directed to the focal points of viral spread some effective measures include the pharmaceutical industry factories retailers of medicines ppe etc are collaborating better and re-directing their production lines to covid-19 related products for example high-level fashion brands such as armani gucci and others are producing masks and protective garments for healthcare workers and alcoholic beverage brands are directing their production to disinfectant gel in addition solidarity is removing some commercial confidentiality barriers forming novel supply chains or easing trade restrictions under certain circumstances while increasing them on others for example the eu introduced a temporary 6 weeks export ban on certain medicalprotective equipment to destinations outside the eu commission implementing regulation 2020402 14 march 2020
29the general lack of understanding of this new virus led to confusion and mixed advice from professionals and authorities the global community political medical and international organisations were taken by complete surprise in its rapid spread from china and establishment of community spread in italy iran spain and at present in the us at the time of writing the world is overwhelmed with covid-19 patients and countries are applying risk mitigation measures at an unprecedented level with almost daily updates in europe in the current major hotspots in italy and spain and recently in the us in new york hospitals are being overwhelmed and responders are combatting the pandemic by all possible means since the rules and policies adopted by many countries differ as well as societal and population structure and healthcare systems the mitigation measures will likely lead to various results it will be interesting to see the exact impact of the different strategies but unfortunately it is still too early and it is not yet possible to give quantitative advice the intention of this paper is to highlight the importance of building trust improving effective communication processes with cross-country and cross-sectoral information sharing enhancing the learning process and in turn enhancing risk governance mechanisms the conceptual analysis in this paper aimed to provide a structure in the countless risk mitigation measures taken around the world knowing it is a snapshot in time and lots of effort is currently being undertaken the authors collated and clustered risk mitigation measures using a harmonisation of the taxonomical approach available for countries combatting the covid-19 pandemic and investing in the limitation of the spread of the virus our work mainly focusses on the limitation of the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus causing covid-19 current knowledge reveals thatthe information published on risk mitigation measures and their effectiveness is difficult to find and more and more papers are being published every daycovid-19 demonstrates the weaknesses of the current systems the world was insufficiently prepared scientific warnings were not picked up quickly enough there were confusing messages and trust building took too much time specifically many countries started with processes such as understanding the problem from the beginning and not building upon existing knowledge and best practices of other countries this lead to similar outcomes such as disbelief underestimation of the scale and potential danger and losing valuable time in jointly implementing the best risk mitigation practices besides the differences between countries in terms of cultures or economic prosperity this pandemic demonstrates the unpreparedness of many health systems lacking mechanisms and materials to adequately respond to a quickly spreading infection relying on societal and economic improvisationit is suggested that countries where the elderly live among the general population impose more strict restrictive mitigation measures than countries where the elderly are separated from the general populationseveral restrictions have proven effective in slowing down the spread of covid-19 but the highest effect is obtained by applying a combination of measures representing different aims in this regardoit is recommended for all countries to invest in preventive risk mitigation resources limiting the spread of sars-cov-2 comprising physical distancing measures and hygienic measures this is particularly important for countries with fewer resourcesoit is recommended to impose a combination of mitigation measures limiting the spread by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening programme to this end screening programmes need to be improved and applied on a larger scale along with registering the number of hospitalisations and deaths contact tracing is important even if many countries are now believed to have passed this phase due to too high number of infections new technologies could be applied in this respectoit is believed that correctly wearing appropriate face masks is beneficial when physical distancing is not possible to ensure all the time the spread of small drops containing sars-cov-2 is difficult to predict think of air currents convections and air humidity and it is more likely that individuals will touch their face mouthnose less frequently than without a mask it seems that countries who have more effectively curtailed an expanding propagation are countries whose population used masks extensively
a clear and coordinated communication strategy on effective risk mitigation is crucial in building trust with the citizens in a quickly evolving situation using all possible channels and combatting fake newsexisting global mechanisms need strengthened benefiting from interlinked national health mechanisms being part of a network of first responders practitioners or risk mitigation stakeholders is an added value in this scenario for example several partner countries of the eu cbrn coe are reporting to have greatly benefited from the structures that were put in place thanks to the initiative and at least in some countries this mechanism has been found very useful to mobilise a coordinated responsecitizens trust related to the degree of risk mitigation measures in place and parties involved in the communication is highly variable across countries this is expected to influence citizens behaviour and respective implementation and obedience of the imposed risk mitigation measures some countries are also creating child-friendly covid 19 communication material such as comics
30 tv and online broadcasted news
31 in countries and cultures with a higher degree of trust in science authorities and with adequate science based communication faster changes are expectedthe delay in imposing risk mitigation measures is crucial and can make the difference between a local outbreak with few cases to a pandemic with countless sick and deceased citizens the window of opportunity for full containment is believed to be limited to a situation with a very low number of infected people maximum 40 casesproper early detection based on early warnings would lower the intervention time such a mechanism should be based on a response time of hours rather than days

treating infectious disease cases and at high risk of acquiring influenza and other respiratory infections 1 2 3 several outbreaks of new infectious diseases have occurred in recent decades such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 20022003 4 influenza pandemic h1n1 in 2009 5 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 6 and ebola virus diseases in 20142016 7 many healthcare workers were infected and died during these outbreaks because of a lack of infection control 4 8 9 10 various infection control strategies are used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory and other infections in healthcare settings 11 12 these strategies can be broadly classified as administrative control measures environmental control measures and the use of personal protective equipment ppe administrative control measures include developing policies and procedures implementing triage protocols and providing health education and trainings environmental control measures includes ensuring proper ventilation establishing airborne infection isolation and negative pressure rooms developing systems for cleaning and waste disposal 13 14 ppe is commonly used in healthcare settings as standard or transmission based precaution to protect healthcare workers from infections and to prevent further spread to patients around them 14 15ppe is generally ranked lowest in the infection control hierarchy due to less effectiveness compared to other control measures and high expenditure in the long run therefore most infection control guidelines recommend using ppe together with other administrative and environmental control measures however ppe is important during the early stage of an outbreak or a pandemic when drugs a vaccine and other control measures are not available or access is limited commonly used ppe to protect from respiratory infectionsare face masks respirators gloves and goggles or face shields 16 face masks or medical masks and respirators are the most commonly used ppe to protect from influenza and other respiratory infection in healthcare settings however these two products are not the same face masks are not designed for respiratory protection and are used to avoid respiratory droplet and spray of body fluids on the face they are also used by sick patients to prevent spread of pathogens to others referred to as source control or by surgeons in the operating theatre to maintain a sterile operating field face masks are not fit to the face and have varying filtration capacities 17 respirators are designed for respiratory protection and are used to protect from respiratory aerosols 18 a properly fitted respirator provides better protection again respiratory infections than a face mask gloves are used to protect hands from blood and body fluids including respiratory secretions goggles and face shields are used to prevent transfer of respiratory pathogens into the eyes from contaminated hands and other sources gowns coveralls surgical hoods and shoe covers can also be used where procedures on infectious patients generate aerosols or when a new respiratory virus has emerged 18there is an ongoing debate about the selection and use of various types of ppe in healthcare settings this is mainly because of a lack of high quality studies on the use of ppe most studies are observational and on the use of masks andor respirators 18 to date only five randomized clinical trials have been conducted on use of ppe in hospital settings and all were on face masksrespirators 18 moreover most studies on ppe use were conducted in highmiddle income countries and currently there are limited data from low-income countries where the burden of infectious diseases is high it is therefore important to examine the use of ppe in low resource countries to inform infection control policiespakistan has a population of about 200 million as a low-income country its gross domestic product is low as is its expenditure on health 19 the country has one of highest rates of infant and maternal mortality in the south asia region infectious diseases are still among the main causes of death particularly in young children health and surveillance systems are generally weak and limited data are available on infection prevention and control strategies the aim of this study was to examine the use of ppe for respiratory infections in healthcare settings in pakistana systematic review was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelineswe searched for studies on the electronic databases medline and embase using selected key words a combination of keywords were used including face mask or mask or medical mask or surgical mask or cloth mask or respirator or gloves or gowns or coverall or surgical caphood or shoeboot covers or goggles or face shield or eye protection and  respiratory infection or respiratory tract infection or respiratory diseases outbreaks or infectious disease or influenza or pandemic influenza or flu or tuberculosis or pneumonia and pakistan or punjab or sindh or balochistan or khyber pakhtunkhwa we used an open date strategy up to december 2017 we anticipated that studies published in local journals might not be indexed on the medline or embase therefore an additional search was made on google scholar using the same keywords we set a limit of 20 results per page on google scholar and first three pages were reviewed for each keyword search after the initial search we reviewed titles and abstracts and selected studies for full text review fig 1
clinical epidemiological and laboratory-based studies conducted in any part of pakistan and published in english were included in the review the focus of this systematic review was on the use of ppe for prevention of respiratory infections therefore we only included those studies which examined the use of facemask andor respirator in healthcare settings with or without other ppe we only included those studies where ppe was discussed for respiratory infections studies where ppe was examined for general infection control were also included given respiratory protective equipment face masks andor respirators was mentioned we excluded studies on the use of ppe only for bloodborne infections conference abstracts and poster presentations were also excludeda total of 137 studies were found in the initial search after reviewing titles and abstracts 46 studies were selected for full text review finally 13 articles were included in this review table 1
 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 we only found observationalcross-sectional studies on the use of ppe for infectious diseases in healthcare settings in pakistan in all studies data were collected through questionnaires or interviews no clinical trials or laboratory-based studies on the use of ppe in such settings were found seven studies examined the use of ppe in hospital 20 21 22 23 25 and among those two examined the ppe perceptions among medical students 24 or pharmacy students 32 two studies were conducted in the laboratory settings 26 27 while four in dental settings 28 29 30 31 two studies focused on the use of ppe for influenza 24 32 two were for tuberculosis 20 25 and nine studies were on multiple respiratory diseases including influenza 21 22 or general infections 23 26 27 28 29 30 31 only two studies examined the use of ppe alone 21 22 while other studies examined other infection control practices as well 20 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32guidelines and standard operating procedures on ppe do not exist in most of the hospitals 23 or laboratories 26 27 in pakistan two studies examined the guidelines and current practices on the use of face masksrespirators for influenza tuberculosis and sars in pakistan 21 22 recommendations on the use of masks were reported to be inconsistent and different types of product were recommended and used in various healthcare settings 21 22face masks were the most commonly used ppe to protect from respiratory infections in most hospitals in pakistan medical masks were generally used to protect from influenza tuberculosis and other respiratory infections while the use of respirators was limited to high-risk situations 21 22 in a cross-sectional survey among final-year pharmacy students in seven universities of karachi about 60 of 443 participants highlighted the need to cover the nose or mouth to protect from influenza and about 57 highlighted the use of face masks gloves and other ppe 32 laboratory coat and gloves were the most commonly used ppe in the laboratories in pakistan while face masks and eye covers were rarely used 26 27 a survey of dentists working in various settings dental colleges hospitals and private clinics showed that face masks and gloves were also commonly used ppe 29the use of ppe was also reported to be low among health workers according to a hospital-based survey face masks are not provided to patients with tuberculosis and respirators are not provided to the healthcare workers 23 another survey showed that 25 of participants used ppe for patients with suspected tuberculosis and 56 used ppe for patients with confirmed tuberculosis 25 a study in a ward for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis reported that 65 of the healthcare workers used n95 respirators and 58 were provided with a mask 20 a study on 253 biosafety level bsl 2 laboratory workers showed that ppe was not used by about half of the staff 462 27 a countrywide survey showed that almost one third 319 of bsl-2 laboratory workers did not routinely use ppe 26 both gloves and laboratory coats were used by only 267 of the personnel while a laboratory coat or gloves alone were used by 304 and 81 respectively less than 1 of all the respondents across pakistan reported using eye covers 26 in a survey of medical students during pandemic h1n1 2009 75 said that they would use a face mask to protect from infection students with less risk perception were more hesitant to use face masks 24 the use of face masks was common in dental practice and according to various surveys 68100 of dentists wear masks during dental procedures 28 29 30 31 across all the studies in dental settings more than 90 also used gloves among the ppe face masks were considered the most bothersome to use by wearersreuse of ppe was also reported in many studies mainly because of unavailability of ppe and lack of training gowns are shared among the healthcare workers in hospital many times 23 two surveys in dental clinics showed that more than half of the dentist reuse masks during routine work 28 29 the availability of ppe was generally low in all healthcare settings 21 22 28 and varied according to the type 23 gloves and masks were available while gowns and n95 respirators were not available in several wards 23 a shortage of ppe was also reported during sars and pandemic h1n1 2009 21 22 a lack of training was a common issue reported and most healthcare workers were not trained in the use of ppemost of the studies 1113 discussed other infection control practices as well in addition to the use of ppe other non-standard infection control practices included reuse of syringes improper waste disposal a lack of hand hygiene practices non-isolation of infectious cases and low influenza vaccination among healthcare workerswe reviewed the use of ppe in various healthcare settings in pakistan a lack of guidelines and standard operating procedures inconsistent policies and practices low compliance and non-availability and reuse of ppe were the main issues highlighted in this study evidence is lacking on the use of ppe in hospitals and other healthcare settings in pakistan and most studies are of low quality clinical studies should be conducted to examine the effectiveness of ppe and improve the compliance reuse of ppe may increase the risk of self-contamination to the wearer and this practice should be discontinued there is a need to improve the availability of ppe and healthcare workers should be trained ppe is generally considered lowest in the infection control hierarchy and is generally recommended in combination with other control measures other infection control practices in such settings should also be examineddifferent types of ppe are used by healthcare workers in pakistan which reflects a lack of standard policies and guidelines the different policies and practices may be because of the different recommendations by the world health organization who and the united states us centers for disease control and prevention cdc 33 34 debate continues about the selection and use ppe for different infections for example face masks versus respirators gowns versus coveralls face shields versus goggles 7 18 34 35 selection of ppe mainly depends on mode of transmission however several individual and organizational factors also contribute the selection and use of ppe such as risk perception presence of adverse events pre-existing medical illness availability and cost 7 respiratory infections are generally transmitted through contact droplet andor airborne routes gloves should be used to protect from infections transmitted through contact eg respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus face masks should be used for droplet infections eg influenza and coronavirus and a respirator should be used to protect form airborne infection eg tuberculosis and measles however infection transmission is rarely by only one route and most infections are transmitted by more than one route 36 for example influenza and sars primarily transmit through droplet and contact routes but airborne transmission has also been reported 37 38 similarly ebola primarily transmits through direct contact with blood and body fluids 39 but animal studies have shown that airborne transmission is also possible 7 the risk of transmission further increases during aerosol-generating and other high-risk procedures 40 41 moreover uncertainty exists about how pathogens transmit during outbreaks and pandemics 14 34 42 43 therefore superior ppe should be used where the mode of transmission is uncertain the case-fatality rate is high and pharmaceutical interventions are not available 7 infection control guidelines in pakistan need to be updated urgently to reflect these recommendations given that mers cov is circulating in the eastern mediterranean region emr policies and practices on the use of ppe in other countries of the region should also be examinedour study also reported low availability of ppe in hospital dental and laboratory settings in pakistan the availability of ppe is a challenge not only in low-resource counties but also in high-income countries particularly during outbreaks and pandemics when the use of ppe greatly increases 46 47 this may result in non-standard practices such as reuse and extended use of ppe shortages of ppe were even reported in many high-income countries during the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic and staff had to use various alternatives 46 47 48 the availability of ppe is important to ensure proper use and compliance low use of ppe among laboratory workers in pakistan may be due to non-availability and a lack of resources for example ppe use was relatively higher in laboratory workers in punjab which is an affluent province than other provinces 26 moreover ppe use was reported more in the private sector in pakistan than the public sector which has fewer resources 27 proper use of ppe depends on several factors such as availability knowledge training risk perception and comfort 7 44 45this study showed the compliance with the use of ppe was generally low among healthcare workers and was mainly due to unavailability of ppe discomfort and a lack of training while the use ppe depends on many factors a greater perception of risk was positively associated with compliance 24 continuous use of face masks and respirators may have psychological and physiological effects on the wearer and result in more adverse events 49 50 51 compliance with the use of face masks has been shown to be based on the nature of the disease infectiousness of patients and the performance of high-risk procedures 52 previous studies have tested the precede predisposing reinforcing and enabling framework to examine healthcare workers compliance with universal precautions 53 the results showed that reinforcing factors such as availability of ppe and less job hindrance and enabling factors such as safety climate and regular feedback were significant predictors of compliance with ppe 53 in addition the health belief model 54 was also used to examine the compliance and use of face mask during the sars outbreak 55 56 perceived susceptibility vulnerability to acquiring sars and close contact with case perceived benefits that face masks can prevent infection and cues to action someone asked them to use face masks were significant predictors of protective behaviour and use of face masks 55our study showed that most healthcare workers were not trained on the use of ppe in pakistan the risk of infection can be reduced with proper training and availability of policies and standard operating procedures 57 however regular monitoring is also required to make sure that healthcare workers are using ppe according to the protocols a study in the us reported many deviations from the protocols even though all healthcare workers were trained 15 this may result in self-contamination to the wearers and the spread of infection to others 58 training programmes should be arranged for newly recruited staff and then annual refresher courses should be providedour study had some limitations the initial search was made on medline and embase but very few studies were retrieved because many papers are not indexed on these databases therefore we also searched google scholar but we only reviewed the first 3 pages after each search so some studies could have been missed however we checked the references lists of the relevant studies and could not find any other studies our search was up to 2017 and studies in 2018 were not included we only considered ppe in this study and did not examine other infection control practices the use of ppe is generally recommended with other administrative and environmental control measuresthe selection and use of ppe vary according to the type of healthcare worker and working environment face masks and gloves were the most commonly used ppe to protect from respiratory and other infections overall compliance with the use of ppe was low and non-availability and reuse of ppe were reported most studies were observational and

studies are of low quality clinical studies should be conducted to examine the effectiveness of ppe and improve the compliance reuse of ppe may increase the risk of self-contamination to the wearer and this practice should be discontinued there is a need to improve the availability of ppe and healthcare workers should be trained ppe is generally considered lowest in the infection control hierarchy and is generally recommended in combination with other control measures other infection control practices in such settings should also be examineddifferent types of ppe are used by healthcare workers in pakistan which reflects a lack of standard policies and guidelines the different policies and practices may be because of the different recommendations by the world health organization who and the united states us centers for disease control and prevention cdc 33 34 debate continues about the selection and use ppe for different infections for example face masks versus respirators gowns versus coveralls face shields versus goggles 7 18 34 35 selection of ppe mainly depends on mode of transmission however several individual and organizational factors also contribute the selection and use of ppe such as risk perception presence of adverse events pre-existing medical illness availability and cost 7 respiratory infections are generally transmitted through contact droplet andor airborne routes gloves should be used to protect from infections transmitted through contact eg respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus face masks should be used for droplet infections eg influenza and coronavirus and a respirator should be used to protect form airborne infection eg tuberculosis and measles however infection transmission is rarely by only one route and most infections are transmitted by more than one route 36 for example influenza and sars primarily transmit through droplet and contact routes but airborne transmission has also been reported 37 38 similarly ebola primarily transmits through direct contact with blood and body fluids 39 but animal studies have shown that airborne transmission is also possible 7 the risk of transmission further increases during aerosol-generating and other high-risk procedures 40 41 moreover uncertainty exists about how pathogens transmit during outbreaks and pandemics 14 34 42 43 therefore superior ppe should be used where the mode of transmission is uncertain the case-fatality rate is high and pharmaceutical interventions are not available 7 infection control guidelines in pakistan need to be updated urgently to reflect these recommendations given that mers cov is circulating in the eastern mediterranean region emr policies and practices on the use of ppe in other countries of the region should also be examinedour study also reported low availability of ppe in hospital dental and laboratory settings in pakistan the availability of ppe is a challenge not only in low-resource counties but also in high-income countries particularly during outbreaks and pandemics when the use of ppe greatly increases 46 47 this may result in non-standard practices such as reuse and extended use of ppe shortages of ppe were even reported in many high-income countries during the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic and staff had to use various alternatives 46 47 48 the availability of ppe is important to ensure proper use and compliance low use of ppe among laboratory workers in pakistan may be due to non-availability and a lack of resources for example ppe use was relatively higher in laboratory workers in punjab which is an affluent province than other provinces 26 moreover ppe use was reported more in the private sector in pakistan than the public sector which has fewer resources 27 proper use of ppe depends on several factors such as availability knowledge training risk perception and comfort 7 44 45this study showed the compliance with the use of ppe was generally low among healthcare workers and was mainly due to unavailability of ppe discomfort and a lack of training while the use ppe depends on many factors a greater perception of risk was positively associated with compliance 24 continuous use of face masks and respirators may have psychological and physiological effects on the wearer and result in more adverse events 49 50 51 compliance with the use of face masks has been shown to be based on the nature of the disease infectiousness of patients and the performance of high-risk procedures 52 previous studies have tested the precede predisposing reinforcing and enabling framework to examine healthcare workers compliance with universal precautions 53 the results showed that reinforcing factors such as availability of ppe and less job hindrance and enabling factors such as safety climate and regular feedback were significant predictors of compliance with ppe 53 in addition the health belief model 54 was also used to examine the compliance and use of face mask during the sars outbreak 55 56 perceived susceptibility vulnerability to acquiring sars and close contact with case perceived benefits that face masks can prevent infection and cues to action someone asked them to use face masks were significant predictors of protective behaviour and use of face masks 55our study showed that most healthcare workers were not trained on the use of ppe in pakistan the risk of infection can be reduced with proper training and availability of policies and standard operating procedures 57 however regular monitoring is also required to make sure that healthcare workers are using ppe according to the protocols a study in the us reported many deviations from the protocols even though all healthcare workers were trained 15 this may result in self-contamination to the wearers and the spread of infection to others 58 training programmes should be arranged for newly recruited staff and then annual refresher courses should be providedour study had some limitations the initial search was made on medline and embase but very few studies were retrieved because many papers are not indexed on these databases therefore we also searched google scholar but we only reviewed the first 3 pages after each search so some studies could have been missed however we checked the references lists of the relevant studies and could not find any other studies our search was up to 2017 and studies in 2018 were not included we only considered ppe in this study and did not examine other infection control practices the use of ppe is generally recommended with other administrative and environmental control measuresthe selection and use of ppe vary according to the type of healthcare worker and working environment face masks and gloves were the most commonly used ppe to protect from respiratory and other infections overall compliance with the use of ppe was low and non-availability and reuse of ppe were reported most studies were observational and large-scale prospective studies are needed to collect more evidence about the use of ppe in healthcare settings in pakistanno funding sourcesaac tested the filtration of mask samples by 3 min in another study 3m products were not used in this study wk declares noneas this was a systematic review of published data ethics approval was not requiredaac devised the structure and topic areas for this review and made the initial search wk and aac reviewed titles and abstracts and selected studies for full text review aac prepared the first draft of manuscript and both authors contributed equally to the final manuscriptroutine hand washing between cases was routinely performed by only 50 of anaesthetists in uk and north american studies8
9 hand-mediated transmission is the major contributing factor to cross infection10 effective hand decontamination prior to every episode of patient contact will result in significant reduction in the carriage of potential pathogens and decrease the incidence of preventable infection11 alcohol denatures proteins and has good activity against enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses alcohol-based hand rubs containing at least 60 ethyl alcohol have been widely endorsed as an effective and efficient method of hand hygiene practice12 13 14
frequent hand washing is the single most important hygiene measure in protection against cross infection and must be actively enforced alcohol-glycerol-based hand wash gels are now located on every anaesthetic machine in every operating room and on every work surface within the hospitals of the university health network in toronto it is essential to wash hands before touching your face or eyes as this seems to have contributed significantly to the spread of sarsa survey of uk consultant anaesthetists revealed only 145 of the respondents routinely wore gloves8 ninety-eight per cent of anaesthetists contact with patients blood could be prevented by routine use of gloves15 guidelines emphasize the requirement for routine glove wearing6
7 blood contamination of surgeons hands decreases from 13 to 2 with the use of double gloves16 a recent cochrane database systematic review advocates double gloving to reduce surgical cross infection17 health canada advises double gloving when attending a suspected sars patient hands must be washed after deglovingonly 352 of uk anaesthetists routinely wear facemasks compared with 753 of north american anesthesiologists8
9 facemasks have two functions the first is patient protection by reducing the risk of iatrogenic infection standard surgical facemasks do reduce the volume of bacterial organisms falling to a surgical site18
19 but the cochrane database review on disposable surgical facemasks in surgery remains equivocal20 the second is self-protection by reducing the risk of nosocomial infection for this purpose standard surgical masks are inadequate because they may have up to a 50 leak and are not sufficiently tight fitting to prevent entraining of room air and aerosols some of the anaesthetists who contracted sars early in the outbreak were only wearing standard surgical facemasks when they intubated infected patientsas a result of the transmission of sars to healthcare workers n95 or equivalent masks are currently mandatory in toronto for all medical personnel they fulfil the filtering efficiency criteria of the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh n95 standard by protecting against droplet and airborne transmission of 95 of particles greater than 03 microns in size21 these masks will offer a high degree of protection against the contact and droplet spread of the coronavirus the n95 masks should be fit tested using an appropriate fit test kit according to the manufacturers instructions22 the pcm 2000 tuberculosis masks meet the n95 filtration criteria and fit the majority of wearers adequately they do not require routine fit testing n95 masks can be worn continuously for 8 h whereas pcm 2000 masks can only be worn continuously for 4 h all of these masks are uncomfortable and increase the work of breathing staff compliance therefore requires motivation and encouragement masks must not be touched or taken down and then re-used as this greatly increases the risk of contaminationtheatre caps may reduce the risk of staff potentially contaminating their hands by touching their hair the nature of the novel coronavirus is such that mucous membrane and eye spread is likely and therefore disposable fluid-resistant long sleeved gowns goggles and disposable full-face shields are recommended for frontline medical staff at risk of exposure to sars hand washing is essential after touching or removing the above itemswe have several years experience of staff using the 3m airmate 3m occupational health and environmental safety division 3m center building 023502-w-70 st paul mn 551441000 usa powered air purifying respirator papr in the bronchoscopy suite when managing patients with suspected tuberculosis the airmate consists of a belt-mounted motor-driven fan high efficiency particulate air hepa filter and a rechargeable battery pack room air is drawn into the filter and delivered under positive pressure to a 3m r-series tyvek head cover via a snap-in hose connector that is sewn into the back of the hood decontaminated air is then circulated from the top of the head cover down over the users face and together with exhaled air exits through holes on the bottom of the faceseal the airmate provides 98100 protection at 0315 microns and has a flow rate of 180 litres min123 the major advantage offered by the airmate is that it completely covers the head thus eliminating the risk of respiratory ocular or skin contamination an n95 mask and goggles are worn underneath the respirator to provide maximal protectionthis is an extremely high-risk procedure as it may result in significant exposure to a particularly high viral load the following guidelines were developed in our institution to minimize the risk to the anaesthetist when intubating a suspected sars patient the guidelines should be followed if there is a high index of suspicion that a patient may have sars1 plan ahead it takes 5 min to fully apply all barrier precautions2 apply n95 mask goggles disposable protective footwear gown and gloves put on the belt-mounted airmate and attach the respirator tubing and tyvek head cover then apply extra gown and gloves all staff assisting to follow same precautions if a powered respirator is unavailable then apply n95 mask goggles disposable theatre cap and a disposable full-face shield3 most experienced anaesthetist available to perform intubation4 standard monitoring iv access instruments drugs ventilator and suction checked5 avoid awake fibreoptic intubation unless specific indication atomized local anaesthetic will aerosolize the virus6 plan for rapid sequence induction rsi and ensure skilled assistant able to perform cricoid pressure rsi may need to be modified if patient has very high aa gradient and is unable to tolerate 30 s of apnoea or has a contraindication to succinylcholine if manual ventilation is anticipated small tidal volumes should be applied7 five minutes of preoxygenation with oxygen 100 and rsi in order to avoid manual ventilation of patients lungs and potential aerosolization of virus from airways ensure high efficiency hydrophobic filter interposed between facemask and breathing circuit or between facemask and laerdal bag8 intubate and confirm correct position of tracheal tube9 institute mechanical ventilation and stabilize patient all airway equipment to be sealed in double zip-locked plastic bag and removed for decontamination and disinfection10 assistant should then wipe down the tyvek head cover with disinfectant accelerated hydrogen peroxide is most effective after exiting the negative-pressure atmosphere the protective barrier clothing is then removed paying close attention to avoid self-contamination the outer gloves are used to remove the outer gown and protective overshoes the outer gloves are then discarded and the inner gloves remove the disinfected head cover and the inner gown the inner gloves are then removed the head cover is discarded the airmate tubing is pasteurized and the belt pack wiped down with disinfectant the n95 mask and goggles are only removed after leaving the room11 after removing protective equipment avoid touching hair or face before washing handsa dedicated operating room is required for known or suspected sars patients warning signs should be posted on the entrance to the operating room and only essential staff should be present the door to the operating room should remain closed for the duration of the case to prevent potential contamination of the corridor in a suspected sars case the breathing circuit and soda lime should all be disposable a disposable high efficiency bacterialviral hydrophobic filter must be placed on the expiratory circuit of the ventilator the patient should be induced and recovered in the operating room itself high-risk procedures or the use of power tools in an open procedure warrants the use of a powered respirator by all medical staff anaesthetists are instructed to wear barrier protection as described abovestrong consideration should be given to the use of prophylactic antiemetics in sars patients undergoing anaesthesia to reduce the risk of vomiting with subsequent contamination and viral spread care must be taken not to contaminate surfaces with the used oropharyngeal suction which should be secured in its own holder on the drip standmeticulous aseptic practice must be emphasized with attention paid to items such as stethoscopes and patients charts single-use disposable pens are supplied separately for each case and must not be removed from the operating room telephones should be used in hands-free mode and cleaned after use all airway adjuncts should be removed before transfer of the patient they should be placed in a secure receptacle directly after use and be removed for decontamination the anaesthetic machine is presumed infectious and must be decontaminatedmost operating rooms are under positive pressure with up to 20 room air exchanges per hour any viral load should therefore decrease quickly however because the coronavirus can live outside the body on inanimate surfaces for up to 24 h the entire operating room should be disinfected after a case involving a suspected sars patientattending a patient with suspected sars requires full precautions the patient should be in strict isolation in a negative-pressure room if patients require supplemental oxygen then nasal catheters should be applied and covered by a surgical facemask venturi-type masks should be avoided as they will disseminate droplet spread if the patient coughs24 continuous positive airway pressure cpap and forms of non-invasive ventilation including bi-level positive airway pressure bipap and high frequency ventilation must be similarly avoided as they increase the viral load in the room procedures in suspected sars patients that induce coughing such as nebulization of medications chest physiotherapy bronchoscopy gastroscopy and airway suctioning increase the risk of aerosolizing the virus22
25 using spacer devices instead of nebulizers and closed suctioning systems help to reduce this risk the ventilators of sars patients must have high efficiency bacterialviral hydrophobic filters placed on the expiratory circuit transportation of an intubated sars patient with a tracheal tube and a laerdal bag requires a similar filter between the tube and the bag to avoid contaminating the atmosphere strict adherence to the infection control precautions detailed above should prevent further transmission of sars to anaesthetists and other medical staffthe toronto sars outbreak has emphasized that we cannot be complacent about infection control our current infection control practices may have been adequate in the past but they have been exposed as entirely inadequate in the presence of the highly infectious sars virus anaesthetists must be rigorous about the application of standard precautions in every day practice in the presence of a known or suspected sars patient full droplet and contact precautions must be applied for additional safety until the exact nature of transmission of the coronavirus is elucidated airborne precautions should be taken with high-risk proceduressars should serve as a new red flag marking our need to change the way we practice infection control and ultimately directing us toward the evolution of a new normalcoronavirus disease covid-19 was first reported in wuhan china wuhan municipal health commission 2019 as of june 30 2020 the number of confirmed cases exceeded 101 million with over 05 million mortalities in particular in the united states the number of confirmed cases has all exceeded 2 million accounting for approximately 25 of total confirmed cases in the globe the proportions of confirmed cases in chile 148 peru 92 united states 77 brazil 64 and spain 53 have all exceeded 5 with the increasing number of covid-19 cases globally countries have utilized precautionary measures against this pandemic main transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 include droplet and contact transmissions airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures agp are performed world health organization 2020b the aerosol deposition on the surface and subsequent resuspension could also be a potential transmission route additionally sars-cov-2 could remain viable in aerosols for 3 hours and has shown to be viable on various surfaces for a period of time plastic 72 h stainless steel 48 h copper 4 h and cardboard 24 h surfaces van doremalen et al 2020sars-cov-2 can spread quickly in relatively confined spaces such as nursing homes orphanages and prisons for examples over 200 infections were reported in a womens prison in wuhan china the epicenter of the outbreak 100 m from a local hospital for pulmonary diseases yang 2020 as of april 12 2020 a total of 306 inmates and 218 staffs in a prison were tested positive for the covid-19 in cook county the united states cook county sheriffs office 2020 in arkansas 51 of 280 confirmed covid-19 cases were found in nursing homes thv11 digital 2020 in louisiana at least 61 nursing homes have confirmed covid-19 cases totally 261 nursing home residents have tested positive for the virus with 60 deaths wbrz 2020 these are reinforcing evidence that people over the age of 65 are at a higher risk of developing life-threatening complications due to covid-19 looking at the transmission characteristics of sars-cov-2 the most efficient protection measures are mask use and hand hygiene according to previous studies on influenza virus and coronavirus aiello et al 2010 jefferson et al 2011 leung et al 2020 in the globe it is estimated that 8 million children browne 2017 and 1074 million inmates walmsley 2018 live in orphanages and prisons respectively it was estimated that there are approximately 703 million persons aged 65 years or over in the globe and 2 of them are living in the nursing home lloyd-sherlock et al 2020 united nations 2019 elderly people children and inmates in these facilities are people either with limited mobility or deprived of liberty they live in close proximity with others thus close contact is unavoidable although entrance to these facilities is strictly limited which could protect them from outside infectious agents inadequate prevention and control measures taken inside may still exacerbate covid-19 transmissions from within the purpose of this study is to illustrate the rationale of prevention and control measures in nursing homes orphanages and prisons and provide suggestions for general measures health management personal protection measures and prevention measures in specific facilitiesthe elderly in nursing homes are vulnerable populations who are at a higher risk of infection and adverse outcome because they usually live in close proximity to others world health organization 2020a covid-19 has an increased mortality in older people and in those with chronic diseases or immunosuppression in italy the mean age of patients dying for covid-2019 infection was 785 which was 15 years higher as compared with the national sample diagnosed with covid-2019 infection covid-19 surveillance group 2020 the lack of knowledge and proper care may make them more vulnerable therefore to protect residents employees and visitors prevention and control measures should be taken in nursing homes to prevent sars-cov-2 from entering the facility and spreading inside and outside the facilitythe covid-19 outbreak has led to a level of heightened vigilance in the community which involves the extra responsibility of caring for children in need of protection and those who cannot be cared for by their biological parents as an orphanage although the confirmed covid-19 cases in children account for a relatively small proportion at this point there is evidence that children are also susceptible to covid-19 infection kelvin and halperin 2020 pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children and distinct immunological responses to viral infections might exist in children which can cause severe damage to vital organs campbell and nair 2015 recent study suggests that children with covid-19 are at risk for a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children mis-c with cardiovascular manifestations beroukhim and friedman 2020 in addition children in orphanages live in congregated and relatively confined environment with limited health protection awareness thus the importance to promote the welfare protection and care for children and staffs within the orphanage facility could never be overemphasizedinmates in prisons and other custodial settings live in close proximity with each other under poor ventilation conditions thus the risk level of person-to-person transmission through droplet and aerosol transmissions are higher kamarulzaman et al 2016 in addition inmates generally have a higher number of co-morbid conditions and are in worse health conditions this is made worse by general poorer hygiene and weaker immune defense due to stress and poorer nutrition who regional office for europe 2020 infections can be transmitted between prisoners staffs and visitors between prisons through transfers and staff cross-deployment to and from the community many scholars have appealed for revision of prison guidelines on infection control because most prisoners will eventually be released back into their communities and may further spread infectious diseases moazen et al 2019 moreover during covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 clusters in this setting have the potential to overwhelm prison health-care services kinner et al 2020the nursing homes orphanages and prisons should establish the prevention and control system and develop emergency plans during covid-19 pandemic the establishment of health monitoring is helpful in early detection of covid-19 cases especially those with mild symptoms heymann and shindo 2020 close management should be adopted during the covid-19 pandemic and personnel in and out especially visits should be reduced since as high as 60 of all infections were converted from cases with mild symptom or asymptotic cases admission health screening should be carried out to mitigate asymptomatic transmission qiu 2020 it is also suggested to set isolation observation area in each facility for people who develop symptoms in particular people who are new to nursing homes orphanages and prisons should be isolated for at least 14 days similarly children or the elderly who leave or relocate from facilities as well as people who are released from prisons should be isolated for 14 days for facilities providing shuttles for workers measurement of body temperature should be carried out before getting on people with suspected symptoms of fever cough sneezing should not be allowed to enter these facilities since the control of covid-19 needs at least a couple of months the preparation of sufficient protection products masks disinfectants gloves etc is highly recommended meanwhile distribution priority of medical supplies should be given to healthcare workers providing care services eg front-line healthcare workers nursing staff in institutions and healthcare personnel in private clinics personnel who provide essential services and who are required to have contact with the public at work eg those providing public transport emergency services and immigration services and marginalized and vulnerable groups in the society eg unaccompanied children elderly people without family support and disabled persons health education should also be carried out to increase the protection awareness via training posters videos etc during the covid-19 pandemic nursing homes orphanages and prisons should provide psychological consulting services to the elderly children inmates and workers to mitigate probable negative emotions such as anxiety and panic under the stressventilation is one of the most effective measures to significantly reduce the exposure to infectious diseases zhai 2020 therefore the ventilation during covid-19 should be strengthened under the prerequisite of thermal comfort natural ventilation is preferred it is recommended to open the window 2 or more times a day with duration of 05 h for facilities using air conditioners for ventilation and indoor temperature adjustment it is suggested to regularly clean and disinfect the air inlet and outlet of the air conditioner using chlorine containing disinfectant with available chlorine content of 500mgl and strengthen the cleaning and disinfection of the condensate pan and cooling water of the fan coil unit the operation of hand washing facilities should be maintained regularly also the wastes should be classified before disposal and the disinfection frequency of waste containers could be increased spraying or wiping disinfections using chlorine containing disinfectant with available chlorine content of 500 mgl are recommended in addition since sars-cov-2 may spread through contaminated waste surfaces and aerosols from wastewater systems it is necessary to assess disease prevalence and spread by monitoring the viral rna in wastewater for early warning of covid-19 outbreaks nghiem et al 2020indoor and outdoor environment of facilities should be kept clean and hygienic daily cleaning and disinfection measures should be recorded the floor could be kept clean using chlorine containing disinfectant with available chlorine content of 250500 mgl vomitus could be covered and disinfected using disposal water absorbing materials and adequate disinfectant or effective disinfection towel after removal of vomitus the object surface should be disinfected using quaternary ammonium salt disinfectant or chlorine containing disinfectantthe restroom should be kept clean and dry in addition ideal ventilation and disinfection frequency should be adjusted according to actual situation the sink shower and other drainage pipes should be frequently checked to ensure the effect of water seal of u-shaped pipe and sewer the surface of public table sink door handle and other objects should be disinfected using chlorine containing disinfectant with available chlorine content of 500 mgl after then wipe the surface with clean water 30 minutes after spraying or wiping disinfection gatherings leisure activity having meal workout etc should be reduced and the personnel density should be well controlled bedford et al 2020 the dining room in use as well as used kitchen utensils should be disinfected after each meal food debris must be removed before the disinfection of tableware because the presence of organic matters would weaken the disinfection performance it is recommended to disinfect the kitchen utensils via boiling or steam for 15 min disinfection cabinet or soaking in chlorine containing disinfectant with available chlorine content of 250 mgl and wash completely after disinfectin congregated places people are encouraged to correctly wear the mask and enhance hand hygiene simultaneously to stop the spread of sars-cov-2 it is recommended to avoid large gatherings direct contact with public facilities or public objects and maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other people fiorino et al 2020 avoid touching face with hands or gloves to minimize spread of sars-cov-2 and other pathogens when cough or sneezing people are suggested to cover their mouth and nose using the napkin or elbow and wash hands completely using soap or liquid soap after throwing the used napkin into the dustbin when communicating with others direct contact without mask should be avoided under the condition of sufficient protection products supply people could consider to use hand sanitizer and keep hands clean all the time in orphanages specific masks or face shield should be prepared for children because the use of adult masks might lead to air leak and expose them to infection the care givers should also rationally guide children to wear the mask or face shield in certain scenarios such as before eating before and after playing after sneezing etc the protection of infants is indirect because they are not required to wear the mask thus the personal protection of care givers must be strengthenedonce covid-19 case is found in a nursing home the confirmed case and suspected case if any should be immediately isolated from others before entering the isolation area cases should change their clothes throughout the healthcare workers should adopt proper personal protection measures unnecessary personnel in and out should be forbidden in isolation area strict disinfection should be carried out for isolation area and contaminated objects as shown in table 1
personnel with abnormal body temperature cough fatigue diarrhea sore throat or with potential exposure to sars-cov-2 should be isolated in temporary isolation area confirmed and suspected covid-19 cases should be sent to designated hospitals for further treatment the orphanage facility must report the situation to relevant government departments and local cdcs in time in addition orphanages should also conduct investigations on close contacts under the guidance of local health departments a 14-day isolation should also be required for close contacts children and staffs who get back from hospital should be isolated for at least 14 days at the same time the orphanages need to be thoroughly disinfected and the personal belongings should be handled properly all clothes bedding sheets and other textiles should be kept clean and washed regularly if disinfection treatment is required steam or boiling for 30 minutes are recommended it is also feasible to soak with chlorine-containing disinfectants with available chlorine content of 500 mgl for 30 minutes followed by routine cleaning world health organization 2020c restrooms bathrooms and laundries in orphanages should be disinfected on a daily basis with chlorine-containing disinfectants with available chlorine content of 500 mgl then rinsed under running waterif a covid-19 case was found in a prison it is suggested to immediately organize screening for all inmates and staffs people with abnormal symptoms fever cough diarrhea etc should be recorded and examined via computed tomography ct close contacts could be evacuated to other custodial facilities without cases in order to block the transmission routes and reduce the risk of cross infection isolation requirements should be strictly implemented and health monitoring should be enhanced to these close contacts the prison should be divided into case area isolation area isolation observation area and general area it is also recommended to distribute disposable masks to inmates and staffs and guide the use and disposal of the mask the ventilation regular disinfection and personal protection measures should be strengthened and unnecessary personnel in and out should be avoided it is recommended to provide sufficient soap or liquid soap in order to strengthen hand hygiene moreover if the hand hygiene product supply is limited 75 alcohol hand sanitizer could also be utilized to clean hands terminal disinfection must be provided for the places where covid-19 cases lived or stayed for relatively long timeif a covid-19 cluster was found in a prison in addition to prevention measures mentioned above partition management is also recommended cases with severe and moderate symptoms should be arranged in case area cases with mild symptoms those who with positive results of pharyngeal swab viral nucleic acid detection but do not have obvious clinical symptoms such as fever fatigue pneumonia etc should be arranged in isolation area suspected cases close contacts and other people with symptoms of fever cough diarrhea etc should be arranged in isolation observation area the rest could stay in general area from the perspective of security the partition management for prison staffs and inmates should be separated healthcare area of other diseases should be strictly separated with case area isolation area isolation observation area and general area to avoid cross infection if the prison has limited isolation and medical conditions it is recommended to transfer confirmed cases and suspected cases to covid-19 designated hospitals and strengthen the custody during the treatmentthe elderly in nursing homes children in orphanages and inmates in prisons are marginalized and vulnerable groups in the society however they live in congregated and relatively confined environment due to specific management which significantly increase their risks exposed to covid-19 therefore it is crucial to strictly implement routine cleaning and disinfection measures and publicize health protection knowledge to improve the awareness the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the pathogens which requires all to work together and comply with the rules fig 1
 inter-intra-national cooperation should be encouraged each country should establish nationwide prevention and control strategies and health departments should provide technical support to nursing homes orphanages and prisons facilities should have sufficient management oversight of practice previously proposed on a daily basis and arrangements in place to ensure proper scrutiny of the well-being of the elderly children and inmates apart from these everyone should stay informed and vigilant and update information from health departments or other official channels in a timely way on the other hand social activities and interactions are reduced dramatically during the covid-19 pandemic and people in these facilities become much more socially isolated which might cause more psychological harm therefore close attention must be paid to their mental health especially those who are isolated moreover the health monitoring of people in these facilities should be further improved at national scale it is recommended to establish an access for nursing homes orphanages and prisons in order to directly report outbreak information to the health departmentthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papercoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has struck the world with over 1 million people confirmed with the virus and 56985 attributed deaths as of april 5 2020 1 the causative organism is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 which belongs to the betacoronavirus genus 23 however compared to previous coronavirus infections such as sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers covid-19 has shown a higher transmission rate and rapid progression over a short duration of time 45 due to the alarming level of spread and severity of disease the world health organization who has declared covid-19 a pandemickorea was the one of the earliest countries to experience a large covid-19 outbreak since the first patient was diagnosed as covid-19 positive on january 20 2020 10237 patients have been diagnosed with the infection through april 5th 2020 6 among them 14 patients 8 healthcare workers and 2 caregivers were diagnosed with covid-19 in a hemodialysis hd unit hd patients receive treatment three times a week in a limited space and are particularly vulnerable to infection due to impaired immunity and environmental susceptibility 7 our previous experience fighting mers 8 and developing infection control guidelines for hd facilities 9 was useful as we promptly responded to the covid-19 outbreak this special article introduces our effort to prevent further viral transmission within hd facilities and describes key recommendations for clinical practicewhen the first index case was confirmed in korea on january 20 2020 the joint committee was established immediately to respond to the outbreak and prevent transmission of the disease among hd facilities the joint committee was comprised of nephrologists from the korean society of nephrology and the korean society of dialysis therapy together with the korea centers for disease control  prevention kcdc the committee established and announced the first draft of clinical practice guidelines on january 31 2020 in addition the committee delivered policies of the kcdc to regional nephrologists and arranged for patient referral and transfer together with government authorities owing to the effort of the committee the nephrologists could reference the manual without frustration when the first case was confirmed in an hd facility on february 19 2020case definitions are from the covid-19 response guidelines of the kcdc with cases classified as confirmed case suspected case patient under investigation and contacts table 2 a confirmed case refers to a person who has tested positive for the covid-19 pathogen irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms a suspected case refers to a person who develops a fever  375c or respiratory symptoms within 14 days after contact with a confirmed patient a patient under investigation refers to a suspected case based on a physicians opinion or one who develops a fever  375c or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travelling to a region or country with local transmission of covid-19 lastly contacts within hd facilities are determined after epidemiological investigation by the central and local government under the guidance of the kcdc and are defined in more detail as one of the following 1 a patient who received hd treatment at the same time as a confirmed case 2 a patient who received hd treatment without proper disinfection after hd of a confirmed case or 3 a patient or healthcare worker who was exposed to a confirmed case within 2 metersall medical staffs hd patients and their caregivers should be educated about personal hygiene including washing hands wearing masks and avoiding unnecessary contact surgical masks and hand sanitizer should be available at the entrance of the hd unit healthcare workers hd patients and their caregivers should perform standard contact and droplet precautions including hand hygiene and wearing masks each hd unit should prepare an environment suited to minimize infection transmission such as keeping proper distance between beds the waiting room or resting area should be closed and each hd patient should come in at a reserved time to minimize patient-to-patient contact before arrival at the hd unit all hd patients should be asked about their prior visit to other countries and domestic outbreak regions any patient contact history and their clinical symptomsif a patient is classified as a suspected case or patient under investigation they should contact the local public health center or kcdc call center area number120 or 1339 and follow the instructions in addition if the patient has a fever cough or shortness of breath they should call first and let the healthcare workers know about their symptoms before they visit the hd unit all hd patients should enter the hd unit under the permission of the physician only if they do not have suspicious signs or symptoms of covid-19 it is most important that suspected or confirmed covid-19 patients do not enter the hd unit each hd unit should also prevent secondary transmission of infection by restricting caregivers or visitors in the hd unitlastly inter-hospital transfer should be essentially prohibited during the outbreak unless the transfer of the patient to the other institution has no risk of infection transmission if a confirmed or suspected case should be transferred to another hospital the hd unit should consult in advance with the regional public health center and the hospital that will receive the patientwhen a suspected case visits the hd unit the patient should wear a surgical mask and be isolated temporarily until a decision can be made about their care if the hd unit has the capacity of performing dialysis therapy in a negative-pressure isolation room with a portable dialysis machine the hd unit may perform isolation dialysis therapy until the patient is released from quarantine however if the hd unit cannot accommodate isolation dialysis as is most often the case the patient should be transferred to another hospital with a facility for isolation dialysis each hd unit should establish a transfer plan in consultation with the regional public health center or the infection control department and should secure a separate route to evacuate the patient from the hd unit transportation between the hd unit and the referral hospital should be determined by the regional public health center after transfer of the suspected case the hd room and other spaces where the patient stayed should be appropriately disinfected immediatelywhen a patient is confirmed or suspected to have covid-19 they should be isolated in a single room with negative pressure the hd patient should receive hd therapy regularly and separately from other uninfected hd patients therefore the confirmedsuspected case should receive hd therapy in an isolated room with a portable dialysis machine healthcare workers who perform the hd therapy should wear personal protective equipment ppe that includes a mask kf94 or n95 respirator mask with a highly efficient filter function gloves goggles or facial shield and gown level d healthcare workers should perform hand hygiene before and after contacting the patient and after removing ppe the dialysis machine should be disinfected after use according to the manufacturers recommendations the room should be properly cleaned and disinfected after each dialysis session and should be emptied for a few hours before the next use all medical waste should be disposed of according to relevant guidelines the confirmedsuspected case can be released from quarantine if symptoms improve and tests for covid-19 are negative twice with a 24-hour interval if respiratory symptoms later become aggravated a confirmatory test can be repeated until symptoms improvepatients under investigation must not enter the hd unit but should contact the local public health center or kcdc call center area number120 or 1339 and visit a screening center to receive a covid-19 test if such a patient has already visited the hd unit healthcare workers should secure an evacuation route to ensure the patient does not contact other patients the patient under investigation should not receive hd therapy until covid-19 test results turn out negative the patient should receive hd therapy apart from other patients after the test turns negative if respiratory symptoms improve and tests are negative for twice with a 24-hour interval the patient can receive hd therapy together with other patients however if symptoms persist the patient should maintain separate hd therapy even with a twice negative testasymptomatic contacts who have had contact with a confirmed or suspected case should receive screening tests for covid-19 and be referred to the hd with cohort isolation when the test results are negative an hd with cohort isolation is a method of dialysis therapy provided to asymptomatic contacts in the affected hospital at a different time apart from other patients if the contact patient develops fever or respiratory symptoms they are classified as a suspected case and should follow the respective response measures healthcare workers should wear ppe including masks kf94 or n95 gloves goggles or facial shield and a disposable water-proof gown during hd therapy standard contact and droplet precautions should be followed hd with cohort isolation should be maintained for 14 days from the date of contact all asymptomatic contacts should receive a covid-19 screening test on the 13th day from the date of contact and may be released from cohort isolation if the tests are negativethe covid-19 pandemic has posed a global health threat affecting over 1 million people globally with thousands of deaths patients on hd treatment are more vulnerable to infection due to low immune function and high comorbidities since they receive routine treatment usually three times a week in the same hd unit all possible measures should be taken to prevent and eradicate infection transmission there recently a few guidelines from affected countries have been published 511-13 although they describe general principles to prevent viral transmission in hd units they are too broad for real world application the main difference in our korean guidelines is the classification by transmission risk and associated recommended strategy the current guidelines direct clinicians and patients to follow measures of prevention protection screening and isolation and describe the circumstances for release from quarantine we hope these guidelines play a key role in the prevention of secondary transmission of covid-19 during this pandemicthe number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 ie the virus causing coronavirus disease covid-19 is dramatically increasing worldwide since it was first identified and described in china on 31 december 2019 who 2020a reaching therefore the size of a public health emergency of international concern who 2020b and then of a pandemic who 2020c at the time of writing 29 march 2020 the total global number of covid-19 cases has surpassed 570 000 26 000 deaths italy ranks first both in terms of number of covid-19 cases 86 498 and number of deaths 9136 who 2020d at the time of reviewing the manuscript 7 april 2020 the total global number of covid-19 cases has surpassed 1 200 000 67 000 deaths and italy ranks third in terms of number of covid-19 cases 128 948 and first for number of deaths 15 889 who 2020e in italy the first person-to-person transmission was reported on 21 february 2020 since then legal measures regarding the covid-19 emergency have been issued by the italian government civil protection department health minister the istituto superiore di sanit national institute of health other ministries and regional governments the list of these legal measures is continuously updated and is available at presidenza del consiglio dei ministridipartimento della protezione civile 2020a and the chronology of the main steps and actions taken by the italian government for the containment of the covid-19 epidemiological emergency is available at presidenza del consiglio dei ministridipartimento della protezione civile 2020b these extraordinary measures initially concerned the interruption of air traffic to and from china the organization of repatriation flights quarantines for italian travellers returning from china and strict controls at international airports arrival terminals later more stringent measures have been applied including limitation of the mobility of residents suspension of school activities and public events closure of commercial and non-essential production activities initially only in the areas of the first outbreaks and then progressively to the whole national territory spina et al 2020 already documented the response to the covid-19 outbreak of the emergency medical system of the of the area where the outbreak occurred ie metropolitan area of milan lombardy region italy similar measures have been then extended to the whole national territoryas highlighted by semple and cherrie 2020 such a wide spread of covid-19 has led to anxiety and concern among workers who worry about becoming infected during their work andor infecting co-workers customers and family members as a result in this regard despite the many uncertainties about how transmission of respiratory infections like covid-19 occur within workplace settings to date it is assumed that contagion during work activities can be lower or higher depending on several factors eg the work sector the need for close contactless than 1 mof people known to be or suspected of being infected or the need for repeated or extended contact with persons known to be or suspected of being infected of course the risk of infection at work adds to the risk of being infected outside the occupational context thus i very high exposure risk jobs are those with high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of covid-19 during specific medical post-mortem or laboratory procedures eg healthcare laboratory and morgue workers performing aerosol-generating procedures ii high exposure risk jobs are those with high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of covid-19 ie healthcare delivery and support staff medical transport and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected covid-19 patients iii medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent contact with other co-workers the general public andor close contact with people who may be infected with sars-cov-2 but who are not known or suspected covid-19 patients eg schools high-population-density work environments some high-volume retail settings iv lower exposure risk jobs do not require contact with other co-workers the general public andor frequent close contact with people known to be or suspected of being infected with sars-cov-2 osha 2020thus for work sectors in which a low or medium risk of contagion is defined all the prevention and protection provisions established with national and regional rules and directives valid for the general population for the purpose of limiting the spread of the virus ie social distancing proper hands hygiene respiratory hygiene etc who 2020f should be applied further regular housekeeping practices including routine cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces equipment and other elements of the work environment should be adopted regular cleaning with neutral detergent followed by disinfection is recommended using hospital disinfectants active against viruses 01 sodium hypochlorite solution or a 70 ethanol solution ecdc 2020 for working conditions that foresee a medium risk of contagion and in particular in cases where the practice of social distancing is not strictly applicable the use of personal protective equipment ppe for the protection of the respiratory tract such as medicalsurgical masks or filter masks at least as protective as a us national institute for occupational safety and health niosh-certified n95 european union eu standard ffp2 or equivalent must also be consideredfor jobs where an occupational biological risk exists a priori due to deliberate use of biological agents andor because of the presence of biological risk inherent in the type of activity carried out ie those jobs that were classified as of very high or high risk of exposure it is advisable that the employerswith the support of professionals in the field of occupational hygiene and risk assessmentcheck whether in their risk assessment procedure the prevention and protection measures already adopted are sufficiently adequate for the purpose of controlling exposure to sars-cov-2 and its transmission for these types of work further control measures are envisaged which follow the classic hierarchy of containmentisolation of the risk factor use of engineering measures to favour the proper ventilation of the rooms the definition of procedural and organizational measures and the use of suitable ppe eg disposable gowns and gloves eye protection and respiratory protection ecdc 2020 istituto superiore di sanit 2020 osha 2020 who 2020ghconcerning the use of respiratory ppe several references invite a rational use of these resources also considering their limited availability and the possibility for structures in need of such equipment to be in conditions of shortage and lack of supplies thus ppe such as ffp2 or n95 masks or other analogous ppe with equivalent classification such as reported in cdc 2020a should be used specifically and primarily by healthcare workers involved in aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation non-invasive ventilation tracheotomy cardiopulmonary resuscitation manual ventilation before intubation and bronchoscopy which as told have been associated with an increased risk of transmission of coronavirus ecdc 2020 istituto superiore di sanit 2020 osha 2020 who 2020gh regarding the use of this equipment by other categories of workers or by the general population not occupationally exposed the general guidelines distributed by authoritative bodies on the behaviour to be followed during the virus emergency should be primarily considered who 2020g the utmost attention in the use and management of medicalsurgical masks and respiratory ppe is recommended also to compensate for any supply problems in this sense various indications have been provided for the rational use of these resources in workplaces to meet the needs of masks and ppe in conditions of limited availability generally by suggesting priority criteria for the allocation of available resources according to the activities to be carried out but also suggesting the limited re-use and the extended use of ppe in certain circumstances and ensuring compliance with some rules of good practice cdc 2020ab ecdc 2020 who 2020h based on the information currently available we are not aware of recognized efficacy methods that have been adequately studied to safely disinfect or sterilize disposable ppe with a facial filter numerous studies have been conducted showing that some efficient disinfection methods are able to make infectious agents non-viable for some models of respirators viscusi et al 2009 2011 bergman et al 2010 fisher et al 2010 2011 fisher and shaffer 2011 heimbuch et al 2011 2014 lindsley et al 2015 mills et al 2018 although the effect of these methods on the level of degradation of the materials that constitute the ppe and in particular on the filter itself is not known bailar et al 2006 have not been determined individual ppe manufacturers may provide reliable recommendations on this particular issue disinfection methods can lead to ppe alterations which can affect the level of protection these changes may relate to performance eg filtration efficiency or adaptability eg degradation of laces nose strap material strap accessories or a combination of these eg metal components which when heated damage the filter material around to them finally it should be noted that recently pilot studies have been carried out to identify treatment methods for ffp2 masks which do not damage the masks structure and which make it possible to re-use them under certain conditions at present these methodologies have not been sufficiently testedin particular for covid-19and the results although interesting do not lead to generalizable conclusions on a large scale rivm 2020in italy concerning the current shortage of medical masks and respiratory protective devices legislative decree no 92020 art 34 paragraph 3 disposes that in relation to the covid-19 emergency in accordance with the guidelines of the world health organization and in accordance with current scientific evidence it is allowed to resort to surgical masks as a suitable device to protect health workers masks without the ce marking can also be used after evaluation by the istituto superiore di sanit further law n 18 17 march 2020 also disposes the extraordinary and derogation validation of the ppe in particular article 15 of this decree dictates extraordinary provisions for the management of the covid-19 emergency and attributes to inail the national institute for insurance against accidents at work the function of extraordinary validation and in derogation of the ppe the ppe affected by the provision are only those functional to mitigate the risks connected to the current covid-19 presidenza del consiglio dei ministridipartimento della protezione civile 2020abhowever the decision to adopt procedural measures for the rational use of ppe involving for example prolonged use or limited re-use of ppe for the respiratory tract should be made on a case-by-case basis by professionals managing the institutions prevention and protection programme in accordance with the indications provided by the competent authorities taking into account the known characteristics of the sars-cov-2 and some specific conditions eg number of devices available rate of use etc of the considered scenario in any case all deviations from the standard and consolidated regulatory practice must be taken only as temporary emergency measuresfor what has been said in addition to the scientific research topics already suggested by semple and cherrie 2020 concerning i the relevant importance of inhaled exposure compared with surface contamination and hand-to-peri-oral routes in the transmission of covid-19 ii the efficiency of different types of ppe in reducing both inhaled and surface transmission iii simple structural and behavioural changes in the workplace to be encouraged to reduce the risk of transmission we believe it is useful to address the need for professional expertise in the field of occupational hygiene this is urgently needed in particular in this emergency context since the available evidence as well as the indications that are provided by numerous international bodies by research groups and by the scientific literature as well as the legal provisions are constantly and rapidly evolving it is of fundamental importance to be able to effectively analyse and rationalize all these inputs to provide very precise and focussed indications to health safety and environmental managers and prevention operators in workplaces that would struggle to manage a constantly changing situation in this regard not only a constant update of the regulatory situation is needed but also the formulation and effective distribution to all the stakeholders of operational guidance to translate general indications into actual operating procedures and implementation tools to be adopted in workplaces in choosing the most correct protection measures to be adopted to prevent the exposure to the risk of contagion and to protect the health of the workers the professional expertise of occupational hygienists will also be fundamental in the phase following the current emergency phase once the limitations in force today will be gradually revoked and commercial and non-essential production activities will start again at this stage it will still be necessary to guarantee adequate conditions health and safety for workers and the whole public to avoid a new spread of infectionswe believe it useful to underline the fundamental role of scientific associations in the field of occupational hygiene and prevention which must play this fundamental role of guide for prevention professionals for this reason the italian association of industrial hygienists aidiiassociazione italiana degli igienisti industriali published documents containing operational guidelines to provide correct and constantly updated information for i workers employed in essential activities with low and medium risk of contagion ii health workers and other workers at high or very high risk contagion and iii for the correct use and management of ppe for workers and for the population in general these documents are based on the systematic review of the scientific literature but also on national and international regulations guidelines technical reports on the practices to be implemented to contain the risk of covid-19 in occupational environments and healthcare facilities these documents are regularly updated and freely accessible on the website wwwaidiiit and the social networks of the association and have been distributed to all its members it is necessary to point out that the documents produced are not intended to replace those produced by authoritative bodies but intend to support them by reporting an effective summary and enhancing them they recommend measures that are to be taken in light of the italian legislation on the subject to prevent and protect workers health and provide instructions for specific aspects such as detailed procedures for correctly wearing and handling ppe we agree with semple and cherrie 2020 that there is considerable expertise in the occupational hygiene and exposure science and professional communities that can contribute helping employers and workers to contain and delay the spread of covid-19 the challenge is to produce appropriate knowledge tools and methodologies possibly by coordinating the initiatives of different scientific associations and to effectively transfer them to employers and workersat present humanity is threatened by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic the risk of severe infection with the virus depends heavily on physical factors of the infected persons and the quality of the medical system according to a recent study the estimated infection fatality ratio ifr averaged over all age-groups including those who dont have symptoms is between 02 and 16 with an average of 066 verity et al 2020 these numbers look small and the fatality risk may seem acceptable and therefore the danger is often marginalized this is surprising considering that the apollo crew the space shuttle astronauts and the allied soldiers during the 2003 iraq war took a deadly risk of this magnitude only very few people take such risks voluntarily and with full consciousness for comparison the lethal risk of a fatal accident with a commercial aircraft was 17700000 in 2008 and even such a small risk is not taken by some people considering that the ifr of the seasonal flu is about 00401 centers for disease 2010 or even much lower wong et al 2013 the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 appears to be significantly higher than for influenza flu although the numbers for sars-cov-2 are quite preliminary and the estimates may drop over time verity et al 2020 faust et al 2020 it is quite clear that the strategy of herd immunization of the population is not an option as the number of victims would be far too high great hopes for coping with the pandemic currently rest on the development of a vaccine unfortunately it is completely uncertain when an effective and well-tolerated vaccine will be generally available to contain the pandemic drugs such as chloroquine remdesivir lopinavir and ritonavir are also considered to be great sources of hope in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 grein at al 2020 however even if one of the drugs should prove to be effective there is no guarantee that the drug can be made available to the world population in sufficient quantities in addition it is possible that despite the use of drugs going through a severe course of disease can lead to lifelong neuropsychiatric sequelae troyer et al 2020 zandifar  badrfam 2020 or cause other diseases ackermann et al 2020 varga et al 2020containing the pandemic is therefore the only viable way to quench the spread of the virus but containing the pandemic is a difficult task as about 44 of sars-cov-2 infections are caused by people with a presymptomatic and asymptomatic course of infection he et al 2020 therefore due to the absence of symptoms many people do not know that they are infected and are spreading the virus and these people make it very difficult to trace the transmission chains furthermore about 10 of infected people are responsible for 80 of infections kupferschmidt 2020 lloyd-smith et al 2005 people who have many social contacts at work or in their private lives and who do not protect themselves and others sufficiently by observing the rules of distance and hygiene or who consider the risk of the virus to be low appear to be a serious problem in the actual pandemic for these reasons the government must act at various levels to avert great harm to the population the effectiveness of the containment strategy depends on1how societies are able to protect themselves personally against infection through hygiene social distance and technical aids such as protective masks glasses gloves2how well the infrastructure is in place to identify the infection chains and effectively contain the spread eg through mobile data collection isolation or a lockdown3how well the seriously ill can be treated in hospitals
in view of these prospects it seems necessary for the time being to prevent the spread of the virus and to treat those infected as well as possible in order to ensure the latter the capacities of the health system must not be overloaded but it is clear that this condition means that the pandemic will last for years without a vaccine to not overload the medical system governments are pursuing the concept of containment by means of a lockdown because it proved successful in st louis during the spanish flu of 1918 this approach is quite effective when the population obeys the rules but the impact on the state economy and society is devastating when the lockdown lasts longer than a few weeks therefore this concept is not a viable way to contain the pandemic in the long term consequently it is necessary to fight the infection where it occursunderstanding the transmission pathways is the key to finding effective measures to block the infection and to reliably protect healthcare workers and the population contact infection were initially assumed to be the main transmission route of sars-cov-2 today hygiene measures and the avoidance of shaking hands effectively prevent this path of infection droplet infection is currently assumed to be the main transmission route over short distances wang et al 2020 since this path of infection is via the air the rules of distance are effective soper 1919 and wells et al 1936 but it is also known that sars-cov-2 can remain infectious in aerosols for more than 3 h at least under laboratory conditions at high humidity van doremalen et al 2020 and pyankov et al 2018 it is therefore conceivable that infections can also occur under special conditions over long distances provided that the local virus concentration reaches the minimum infection dose due to poor air exchange in roomsa significant proportion of the aerosol exhaled by humans has a diameter of less than 10 m johnson et al 2011 when breathing speaking singing and coughing it is also known that the size and number of droplets increases with the volume of the voice asadi et al 2019 loudon  roberts 1968 and it is known that upper respiratory tract diseases increase the production of aerosol particles lee et al 2019 water droplets of this size evaporate within a few seconds at normal humidity liu et al 2019 and rensink 2004 droplets with a diameter of 10 m for instance are evaporated after about 1 s at 50 relative humidity and larger droplets sink quickly to the ground and evaporate marin et al 2016 2019 rossi et al 2019 if the viruses are released as naked viruses together with the salt after the droplets have evaporated the spatial concentration decreases rapidly over time as the viruses no longer move in a correlated manner but quickly separate due to the chaotic turbulent flow motion the viral load thus decreases rapidly in time and space making infections over long distances or long periods of time increasingly unlikely for this reason it is most important to understand the transmission of the virus over short distanceshygiene regulations and social distancing are very effective in blocking short distance infections during the lockdown the distance rules can usually be adhered to but what happens when the actual lockdown is over and the people meet again in a confined space then additional effective and efficient protection is essential to stabilise infection rates since the viruses are spread by contact and droplet infection technical devices are required that effectively intervene in the chain of infection and effectively block infection an effective protection is the respiratory mask as known since 100 years soper 1919 the sars outbreak in hong kong suggested that the use of simple face masks may have contributed to an overall reduction in the incidence of viral respiratory infections leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 another study has shown that even a simple surgical mask can effectively reduce sars infection seto et al 2003 these results are supported by recent articles chu et al 2020 howard et al 2020 leung et al 2020b zhang et al 2020it was surprizing that for months who the cdc and many public health professionals in europe advised against wearing face masks unless someone has covid-19 or cares for someone who has covid-19 feng et al 2020 leung et al 2020a this recommendation was based on three allegations first it was said that there is no scientific evidence that face masks can protect against dropletaerosol infections second it was argued that the population will not be able to wear the masks properly third the statement that people will feel safe when wearing masks and then become careless and take risks was frequently made at the same time these experts have stressed that health professionals urgently need face masks to protect themselves effectively this contradiction has created uncertainty among the population and called into question the credibility of the experts it is a fact that particle filtration masks are recognized as legal occupational safety equipment and that the wearing of these masks in contaminated areas is required by labor law there is therefore no doubt that these masks when used correctly provide effective protection within the specification range the effectiveness of simple mouth-and-nose covers and surgical masks is less well accepted the international council of nurses icn estimates that on average 7 of all confirmed cases of covid-19 are among healthcare workers icn 2020 this illustrates that surgical masks may not provide the reliable protection against droplet infection as anticipated it is therefore very important to distinguish clearly between the different mask types when talking about their protective function unfortunately this was not done sufficiently by the virologists and politically responsible persons in the initial phase of the pandemic also the second argument is questionable why should the people of western societies not be able to protect themselves as many people in east asian countries have long been doing many people in east asian countries have already recognized through numerous pandemics that proper masks work effectively it does not seem right to regard the western population as unteachable or even incapable the third argument is also false because the opposite is true according to scientific studies kimberly et al 2020 scott et al 2007 and ruedl et al 2012 if people protect themselves personally they have dealt with the danger and therefore they benefit from the protection of the safety device and from the less risky behaviour due to insight the reason why these facts were not appreciated by the experts is due to the attempt to prevent competition for protective masks between medical personnel and the publicin the meantime the general perception of the protective effect of face masks has become generally accepted in the usa the cdc has changed its guidelines and recommended that the public wear fabric face masks in other countries too it is now recommended to protect themselves with suitable masks however it is recommended by governments and professionals to wear only simple mouse-and-nose covers that can be manufactured by the people themselves or surgical masks to avoid distribution battles with medical staff for certified and comfortable particle filtration masks but the big question is how effectively these homemade mouth-and-nose covers and surgical masks can protect against droplet infection the answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour leung et al 2020 one study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with covid-19 bae et al 2020 another study suggests that any mask no matter how efficiently it filters or how well it is sealed has minimal effect unless used in conjunction with other preventive measures such as isolation of infected cases immunization good respiratory etiquette and regular hand hygiene kwok et al 2015 these findings contradict the results in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 seto et al 2003 due to the contradiction it is understandable that experts in the media have expressed the opinion that there is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of masks and therefore the wearing of masks in public was not recommended for a long time the fallacy of politicians and virologists however was to generalize the results obtained with simple mouth-and-nose covers to all masks without differentiationin order to clarify whether or to what extent these masks offer effective protection against droplet infection and to understand why research results differ on this simple scientific question we have carried out these tests first we analyse the flow blockage caused by surgical masks when coughing as this is essential for the protection of others and because coughing is a typical symptom of covid-19 second we qualify the effectiveness of different filter materials and masks to determine the protection ability against droplets finally we prove the effect of gap flows at the edge of surgical and particle filtrating respiratory masks in contrast to the medical studies cited we apply engineering research methods of fluid mechanics the use of this research approach has several reasons firstly the detachment of droplets in the lungs and throat and their convective transport through the mouth into the atmosphere until inhalation as well as the deposit and evaporation of droplets is a purely fluid mechanical process secondly the effective blocking of the flow with suitable masks is a research subject of fluid mechanics thirdly the filtering of particles from an air stream with the aid of suitable materials is also a purely fluid mechanical problem as well as the gap flow finally this approach also has the advantage that the results are reproducible in a statistical sense since the boundary conditions are well defined we are not studying whether an infection really occurs in a special case but whether an infection is physically possible in generalin the first sets of the experiments outlined in section 31 the flow field generated by coughing without and with a surgical mask is examined as coughing sets the air strongly in motion and because coughing is a typical symptom of covid-19 to measure the flow field quantitatively in space and time we use particle image velocimetry piv raffel et al 2018 for the measurements a 8 m long testing room with a cross section of 2 m  2 m was seeded with dehs di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacat tracer particles with a mean diameter of 1 m khler et al 2002 dehs was used as these droplets do not evaporate as quickly as water droplets the tracer particles provided by a seeding generator pivtec gmbh germany were illuminated in a light-sheet generated with a frequency doubled ndyag laser spitlight piv 100015 innolas laser gmbh germany the light-sheet was oriented normal to the mouth opening and parallel to the symmetry axis of the body and the longitudinal axis of the room the light scattered by the tracer particles were recorded with back illuminated scientific cmos cameras pcoedge 55 pco ag germany equipped with zeiss distagon t lens with a focal length of 35 mm and 50 mm the triggering of the system components was achieved with a programmable timing unit lavision gmbh germany the recorded series of images were evaluated with a commercial computer program davis lavision gmbh germany these quantitative piv measurements allow to determine the area that can be contaminated due to the exhaled air the velocity of the exhaled droplets and the turbulence properties of the flowin the second set of experiments discussed in section 32 common household materials currently used by the population and some medical staff to make simple masks at home were tested but also a surgical mask and a ffp3 mask to visualize their filtering properties the tested materials are given in table 1
 for the investigation a test set-up was installed which largely fulfilled the officially prescribed test conditions in europe din en 149 2009 the materials were installed one after the other in a fixed position in front of the inlet of a rectangular flow channel with a cross-section of 01 m  01 m as shown in fig 1
 the material was held in place with a special clamping device that seals tightly to the duct to avoid leakage flows to explore the filtering performance of the different materials the movement of small aerosol droplets passing through the media was observed visually in front of and behind the filter material with a digital camera we only use droplets whose diameter is less than 2 m since the removal of the smallest droplets in an air stream is the greatest challenge in mask development if these droplets can be effectively filtered out effectively then all droplets larger than 2 m can also be filtered the droplets were generated from dehs with an aerosol generator agf 20 palas gmbh dehs was used again as these droplets are long lasting consequently bias errors due to evaporation effects can be neglected a ndyag double-pulse laser evergreen 200 quantel france was used to illuminate the droplets the output beam was fanned out with a few lenses to form a 1 mm thin light-sheet the light-sheet was located in the middle of the flow channel parallel to the flow direction as indicated in fig 1the scattered light emitted by the illuminated aerosol in the light-sheet plane was recorded with a highly sensitive pco edge 55 scmos camera equipped with a zeiss distagon t lens with a focal length of 50 mm the triggering of the system components and the data recording was realized again with the software davis from lavision the flow velocity was driven by the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the flow box the flow rate through the filter material was adjusted approximately according to the din en 149 2009 test standard 90 lmin the volume flow rate and the movement of the droplets through the filter material was measured optically with high spatial and temporal resolution using piv to calculate the volume flow rate the average flow velocity within the light-sheet plane in the flow channel was measured and it was assumed that this velocity is homogeneous over the cross section of the channel this assumption is justified as the filtering materials are homogeneous and the inflow condition is constant across the filtering material with the know size of the cross section the volume flow rate can be calculated the pressure drops provided in table 1 are calculated from the measured pressure drops and the volume flow rate it is assumed that the pressure loss is proportional to the square of the volume flow rate the pressure drop across the filter material was measured with a testo 480 testo se  co kg germany pressure transducer with an uncertainty of about 3 pafor the third set of experiments analysed in section 33 simple flow visualizations using smoke were performed in order to demonstrate the effect of the gap around the mask edge a person exhaled air seeded with tracer particles while wearing surgical and ffp2 masksin the first series of experiments one person performed a single severe cough while the piv system was measuring the flow field data the video in the supplementary material shows the temporal evolution of the process the results displayed in this subsection show instantaneous velocity fields of various independent time-resolved flow field measurements color-coded is the magnitude of the local flow velocity and the vectors indicate the direction of the flow movement at a given time step in areas where the flow movement remains close to zero over the whole recording time blue color no droplets can penetrate as only the flow can move the particles to other areas large droplets with a diameter of 1 mm or more such as those produced when sneezing lok 2016 can fly ballistic over long distances and occasionally ballistic flying droplets are produced when certain sounds are spoken but sneezing is not a typical covid-10 symptom so that this will not we considered here the small droplets that are normally produced when breathing speaking singing and coughing are immediately slowed down and then move with the flow velocity of the ambient air it is therefore important to study the air set in motion by exhalation furthermore the small droplets are particularly dangerous because they can be inhaled deep into the lungs
fig 2
a shows that the spread of the exhaled air forms a cone like shape similar to a free turbulent jet see video the flow velocity is reaching values up to 1 ms near the mouth but due to the widening of the cone caused by the turbulent mixing and entrainment reuther  khler 2020 the flow velocity decreases in streamwise direction the widening of the area in motion reduces the viral load significantly with distance a single strong cough sets the air in motion over a distance of less than 15 m in the experiments distances of more than 15 m can be considered safe according to these results since no droplets can reach such large distances when accelerated by a single cough however if the cough lasts longer greater distances can be achieved as shown in fig 2b for this reason it is important to dynamically increase the distance to a person if the coughing stimulus is about to last longerthe results in fig 2c illustrate how the spread of the airflow from the mouth during coughing is very effectively inhibited by a surgical mask physically the mask ensures that the directional jet like air movement with high exit velocity from the mouth is converted into an undirected air movement with low velocity behind the mask this is because the exhaled air increases the pressure inside the mask compared to the atmosphere outside and the pressure difference creates a flow movement in all directions this effect is of utmost importance for limiting the virus load in the environment the results show that even a simple mouth-and-nose cover or a surgical mask can effectively protect other people in the vicinity because the mask prevents the droplets from spreading over a wide area a simple mask with sufficient flow resistance therefore provides very effective protection for people in the surrounding area when infected and wearing the mask wearing a mask is therefore absolutely useful to protect others according to our quantitative measurements
fig 2d shows the spread of exhaled air when speaking it can be clearly seen that a greater spread of the exhaled air appears than when coughing with a mask consequently wearing a mask during normal face-to-face conversations and of course also when talking on the smartphone in a human environment is extremely useful to stop the transmission of the sars-cov-2 infection via droplets it must also be taken into account that persons with a presymptomatic or asymptomatic course of infection will infect other persons most likely during face-to-face conversations a mask will therefore make an effective contribution to suppressing this significant path of infectionin this section we want to find out if the material of simple mouth-and-nose covers surgical masks and ffp3 masks can protect the user from droplet infection if the surrounding air is contaminated with sars-cov-2 in this case the mask material must have good filtering properties to stop small droplets that typically occur when speaking singing and coughing since large droplets are easily filtered out by simple materials we focus on small droplets in the range between 03 and 2 m because they are produced in large fractions when speaking singing and coughing and they can penetrate deep into the lungs the droplets were distributed approx 400 mm in front of the filter materials in order to make the motion of the droplets and the filtering ability of the materials clearly visible an inhomogeneous droplet distribution was generated the flow direction is from left to right and the flow state of the incoming air is laminar if the intensity of the scattered light emanating from the droplets is large in front of the filter material left image and close to zero behind the filter material right image the droplets are almost completely filtered out through the material if on the other hand no significant reduction in intensity can be detected behind the filter material the filter effect is negligible the area of the filter mount and the channel edges are not shown in the following images since no relevant flow and droplet information is visible in these areas the results presented are qualitative but intended to be this way to provide readers with visual evidence of the particle penetration through different candidate filter media a better impression of the filter efficiency is obtained by viewing the second video in the supplementary materialthe comparison of the two pictures in fig 3
left shows that almost all droplets pass the tested surgical face mask unhindered consequently this mask does not provide serious self protection against droplet infection only a mixing of the droplet distribution takes place due to the porosity of the filter material it is fatal that medical personnel are often so poorly protected by these masks but it is also fatal for patients if clinical staff with a presymptomatic or asymptomatic course of infection uses these maskseven worse than the surgical face masks is the hygiene mask see fig 3 right this mask is designed for catching larger objects such as hair and spook but tiny droplets such as those produced when talking singing and coughing cannot be filtered out of the air stream by the hygiene mask it should also be noted that the flow resistance of the hygiene mask is so low that even the protective mechanism described in subsection 31 does not function effectively fig 4
reveals the effectiveness of particle filtering with toilet paper with 4 layers paper towel coffee filters and microfibre cloth which also offer no serious protection against droplets in this size range only very large droplets are retained by these materials and therefore these materials are suitable for their intended use but not as filter material for small droplets it is therefore strongly discouraged to make masks from these materials with the aim of protecting oneself from infectionfurthermore a very strong fleece was tested which serves as a protective coating on ironing boards the material is 4 mm thick completely opaque and has a pressure drop of about 35 pa however a filter effect is not visible as indicated in fig 5
left the droplet clouds flow almost unfiltered through the fleece even several layers of a dense fabric do not have a proper filtering effect on the considered droplet sizes which escape mainly when breathing speaking singing and coughinggood results could only be achieved with the material of a vacuum cleaner bag with fine dust filter properties see fig 5 right despite the small droplets used in these tests almost all droplets are reliably filtered out consequently also no larger droplets will be able to pass through the material according to the manufacturer swirl the material filters 999 of fine dust down to 03 m diameter this vacuum cleaner bag with fine dust filter therefore has better filtering properties than all tested materials and masks and even an ffp2 protective mask has poorer filtering properties as it only has to filter out 94 of the fine dust down to 06 m to meet the specifications uvex 2020 the material of vacuum cleaner bags with fine dust protection is therefore very well suited as a self-protecting mask if only the filter effect is considered however because vacuum cleaner bags are not certified clinical products they may contain unhealthy ingredients that kill bacteria and harmful fibers that may leak from the bag material it is therefore uncertain whether this material is suitable in practice as a material for a respirator mask
fig 6
left illustrates the filtering capabilities of an ffp3 mask under the test conditions nearly all droplets are filtered out as expected therefore this mask type is very well suited to protect people from an infection by means of aerosols even when the environment is strongly contaminated with infectious droplets recently some hospitals in the usa make use of halyard h600 material to protect their employers from aerosol infection the test result of the material is displayed in fig 6 right it is clearly visible that the filtering capacity of the material is not sufficient to protect people from infection by aerosols if the environment is contaminated with the sars-cov-2 fig 7
shows with different resolution microscopic images of the halyard h600 material it is composed to fibers but the density might not be sufficient to filter the particles used in our investigation there are also tiny holes in the pockets visible which could be the reason why the aerosol passes through the material as the flow resistance at the holes is low compared to the other parts of the materialthe flow tests clearly show that apart from the vacuum cleaner bag and the ffp3 mask the filter effect of the tested materials is not sufficient to protect against droplet infection reliably if the environment is contaminated with sars-cov-2 even masks routinely used by medical staff in hospitals and doctors offices have almost no significant filtering effect on the droplet sizes typically produced when breathing speaking singing and coughing the results are therefore in good agreement with the results from leung et al 2020 and davies et al 2013 and kwok et al 2015 but why has wearing these masks been shown to provide effective protection against infection with the virus in the sars epidemic as shown in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 and seto et al 2003 because a mask is important not only because of its filtering ability but to limit the droplet propagation as discussed in section 31 so in combination with distances these mask can protect if only a few people are infected in the surrounding the results in bae et al 2020 leung et al 2020 are correct but they do not consider the full performance of masks but only a partial aspect therefore the conclusions in the articles are not universal the findings in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 seto et al 2003 are understandable when the full performance of masks in blocking infections is consideredunfortunately wearing a simple mouth-and-nose cover may be less comfortable than wearing a particle filtering face mask in effect this can promote a smear infection since all these transmissions of infection are possible in daily life wearing a comfortable mask is essential to block human-to-human transmission by smear and droplet infection to ensure the best possible protection a particle filtering mask should be used if the number of infected persons in the environment and the viral load in the room is unknown at present social distancing practices and universal masking wearing seem to be the best methods of containing viral pandemic without stricter lockdown policies and without vaccinessome recent studies show that even the simple materials we have tested have some filtering ability davies et al 2013 drewnick 2020 konda et al 2020 and van der sande et al 2008 we do not question these results although the pressure drops in one study is anomalously low see supporting information in konda et al 2020 but we state explicitly that a material that does not have an adequate filtering ability equivalent to an ffp2n95kn95 mask cannot be recommended as a filter material for self-protection against droplet infection statistically speaking every loss of performance leads to an increase in the number of infected people and thus to an increase in the number of death it is therefore very dangerous to recommend materials with some filtering properties as possible materials for self-protection masks but there is another important aspect that will be discussed nextaccording to the previous section one might argue that a mouth-and-nose cover or surgical mask made of a good filter material would provide good protection against infection when infected people are in the vicinity or the room is contaminated with viruses but that will not usually be the case air takes the path of least resistance as these masks do not seal tightly enough with the face droplets can flow unhindered past the edge of the mask when inhaled and exhaled and reach the lungs or the environment if the mask does not fit properly this will even be the rule this is illustrated in fig 8
were a person is exhaling air during an easy exhalation without physical exertion left strong breathing during physical exertion middle and when coughing right the first video in the supplementary material shows the animated sequencesthe analysis shows that it is very important do differentiate between mouth-and-nose cover surgical mask and particle filtering respirator mask because they differ substantial in their fundamental protection properties face masks can offer three fundamental different kind of protection1they effectively prevents a smear infection as the wearers of the masks no longer perform their habitual grip on the face and thus no longer bring the virus from the hand into the mouth or nose howard et al 20202the flow resistance of the mask greatly limits the spread of viruses in the room this significantly reduces the risk of infection in the vicinity of an infected person protection of third parties3the inhalation of droplets containing viruses can be prevented by using a tight-fitting mask with particle filtering properties self-protection
the first fundamental protection mechanism can be reached by all face masks if they fit well and sit comfortably if not the user will touch the face even more than usual to correct the fit of the mask as this can increase the risk of smear infection a good fit of the mask is very important the first and second fundamental protection mechanisms are fulfilled by all masks that have sufficient flow resistance if the mask is worn and a candle can easily be blown out despite the mask the mask does not fulfil this function and should not be used all three fundamental protection mechanisms can be only achieved with ffp2n95kn95 or better particle filtering respirator masktypical materials currently used by the public to build masks reduce the risk of smear infection and effectively prevent the widespread spread of viruses in the environment therefore the use of these mouse-and-nose covers and surgical masks are very important to prevent smear infection and droplet infection to others if the distance is not too close as these masks do not have a significant particle-filtering protective effect against droplets that are typically produced when breathing speaking singing coughing and sneezing they should not be used if the environment is contaminated like in hospitals even when the distance rules are followed to achieve effective self-protection in a virus-contaminated environment masks with particle filtering properties ffp2n95kn95 are absolutely necessary from our point of view if a large number of infected persons are present and distance rules cannot be achieved a very good particle filtration mask ffp3 or better is strongly recommendedif these general rules are followed and all people use suitable particle-filtering respirators correctly the transmission of viruses via dropletsaerosols can be effectively prevented otherwise these types of masks would never have received certification nor would they be a core component of the personal protective equipment in hospitals and other environments therefore proper face masks can save lives while maintaining social life and securing the economy and the statebut universal masking alone is not enough for two reasons first many people are not very good at following rules consistently therefore it is advisable to observe the rules of hygiene and distance and to be careful even when wearing a mask in the event of a car accident the occupants are also protected by various devices bumpers crumple zone safety belts airbags head and legroom autonomous assistance systems  second some people are extremely bad at following rules either because they do not want to or because they simply cannot these people can become super spreaders therefore the early detection of sources of infection and their isolation remains important beside universal masking and the rules of hygiene and distancein mid-december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 emerged in wuhan china and rapidly spread to other areas globally1 the world health organization declared the pneumonia outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern2 the confirmed patients are the main source of infection however patients in the latent period and asymptomatic patients can be potential sources of infection1 people are generally vulnerable including children13-6 most patients have symptoms of fever cough and myalgia or fatigue while a small number of patients have symptoms of vomiting diarrhea and abdominal pain16-8 a minority of patients seek medical care with gastrointestinal symptoms as the first manifestation5 the detection of covid-19 nucleic acid from fecal specimens suggests the possibility of transmission via the gastrointestinal tract159 although this possibility remains to be further clarified digestive endoscopy is an invasive procedure during which children cannot wear masks therefore they have higher risks of exposure to covid-19 and the digestive endoscopy center is a relatively high-risk area for covid-19 infection based on the above factors and in combination with related policies regulations and norms110 a prevention and control program for the covid-19 pneumonia in a childrens digestive endoscopy center was established to prevent the covid-19 nosocomial infection and provide guidelines for endoscopists11-17 after being approved by the director of shenzhen childrens hospital this program was initiated from february 1 2020 it was also put into practice in shenzhen baoan maternal and child health hospital as suggested by the pediatric committee of shenzhen medical association the case detection rate and the nosocomial infection rate were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the programduring the covid-19 epidemic it is recommended that ordinary gastroscopy colonoscopy and enteroscopy should be suspended only endoscopy for emergency diagnosis and treatment is kept in normal operation and is required to proceed as follows 1 the clinical physician should determine whether the child needs emergency endoscopic diagnosis or treatment if it is not urgent or the childs condition is stable it is recommended to make an appointment after the epidemic when emergency endoscopy is necessary the physician should rigorously evaluate the childs condition according to the indications for emergency endoscopy and informed the parents of the possible risks 2 indications for selective confined and emergency endoscopy are defined as follows a indications for selective endoscopy common gastrointestinal symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain vomiting abdominal distension and diarrhea a small amount of hematemesis and hematochezia the illness is less severe and the patients condition is good b indications for confined endoscopy foreign body in digestive tract blunt noncorrosive nonobstructive mild gastrointestinal tract bleeding acute abdominal pain suspected henoch-schonlein purpura upper gastrointestinal obstruction endoscopic feeding tube placement dilatation of esophageal stenosis chronic diarrhea suspected inflammatory bowel disease chronic pain that is unrelieved after routine treatment frequent vomiting with unknown causes c indications for emergency endoscopy button buttery magnets sharp or toxic foreign bodies in the digestive tract gastrointestinal tract obstruction caused by foreign bodies endoscopic diagnosis and treatment for massive gastrointestinal bleeding and d for special cases endoscopists consultation is needed to determine whether digestive endoscopy is necessary 3 the epidemiological history of the children and their family members is screened a a history of travel or residence in wuhan or surrounding cities or in other communities where confirmed cases were reported within 14 d b a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms who are from wuhan or surrounding cities or from other communities where confirmed cases were reported within 14 d c cluster onset of disease and d a history of contact with diagnosed patients with covid-19 infection which refers to positive detection of covid-19 nucleic acid in the case of any of the above epidemiological history and any two of the following clinical manifestations the screening procedure should be carried out as suspected casesbased on fever imaging findings of pneumonia and normal or reduced white blood cell count or reduced lymphocyte count1 4 emergency endoscopy will be arranged if the patient has a history of the above epidemiology but no fever no imaging manifestation or no leukocyte decline or lymphocyte decline 5 on the day of examination the staff should take the temperature of all children and their family members who enter the digestive endoscopy center if the childrens temperature exceeds 373 c they should be immediately sent to the fever clinic for further assessment if their family members temperature exceeds 373 c they should be referred to a designated fever clinic for consultation if the childs temperature is normal endoscopy will be arranged directly 6 children and their family members are required to wear masks before they arrive at the endoscopy center after confirming that the children and their family members have no fever epidemiological exposure or any symptoms the staff of the front desk should ask the parents to sign the informed consent form 7 the endoscopists should carefully review the documents including informed consent chest computed tomographic findings and routine blood results before beginning endoscopy 8 anesthesiologists should strictly implement disposable oxygen delivery catheters and oxygen masks and closely monitor vital signs during anesthesia to avoid choking quarantine measures should be taken to avoid cross-infection in the anesthesia recovery room and 9 the transport and disinfection protection of children should be supervised by professional nursesall staff in the center including doctors nurses anesthesiologists training staff technicians receptionists and health care workers should report the following on a daily basis 1 any symptoms of fever fatigue and cough and 2 history of contact with a diagnosed or suspected covid-19 pneumonia patient in the case of any of the above patients should be immediately sent to the relevant department for investigation or home isolationif any staff member in the center experiences unprotected contact with a child suspected to have covid-19 medical isolation will be required this staff member can return to work after the child is excluded for infection if any staff member in the center happens to have unprotected contact with a child diagnosed with covid-19 infection the medical isolation period will be at least 14 dall staff members should take their temperature before and after work every day in case of any abnormality they should stop work immediately and receive medical interventions or isolation when necessaryall staff should wash their hands in accordance with the six-step washing method for 2 min or disinfect hands using quick-drying hand sanitizer during the working period1 staff at the front desk and in charge of equipment cleaning and disinfection should adhere to universal protection principles 2 medical workers who have direct contact with children should take first-level protective measures they must wear disposable gowns n95 masks gogglesface shields medical protective caps and shoe covers companion is prohibited from entering the operating room during endoscopy without wearing protective gear 3 during tracheal intubation airway care and sputum suction with the possibility of droplets or spray the staff should wear n95 masks protective face shields latex gloves impermeable isolation clothing protective clothing and respiratory protective hoods if necessary and replace them quickly in case of contamination 4 after endoscopy endoscopists should assign other doctors or training staff to help with the report to avoid contamination of the reporting area and repeatedly taking off and putting on isolation clothes and 5 the staff will take off the isolation gowns after finishing the relevant work followed by hand hygiene and change the mask before entering the rest area to avoid cross infectionduring non-working days the staff should stay at home and avoid gathering with others for meals to reduce the possibility of epidemic transmissionthe channel shunt system is implemented in childrens digestive endoscopy centers that is the medical staff go through the medical channel and the children and their accompanying family members go through the patient channel 1 when children enter the center they must follow the arrangement of the staff voluntarily cooperate with the temperature measurement and minimize the number of accompanying family members the nurses should disinfect the childrens hands with quick-drying hand disinfectant and give the children an age-appropriate protective mask before entering the operating area after endoscopy the children also need to wear masks accompanying family members should take the same disinfection precautions as well children family members and other accompanying persons are prohibited from entering the operating area of the center without disinfection and protective equipment 2 the children and their families should provide their personal information truthfully including any symptoms of fever fatigue and cough the result of total white blood cell count and lymphocyte count the epidemiological history of novel coronavirus pneumonia and radiographic imaging findings of the lungs 3 some screening measures such as chest computed tomography and routine blood tests are necessary family members should cooperate with the staff endoscopy should not be performed if required results are not available and 4 the children will be hospitalized according to the workflow if necessary figure 1common children without epidemiological history or related symptoms 1 at the key stage of epidemic prevention and control endoscopy should be performed in an isolated room endoscopists should be protected according to the first-level protection requirements endoscopy should not be performed without protection and 2 the number of children waiting in a general waiting area should be minimized the distance between each waiting child should be more than 1 meter apart the children and their accompanying family members are instructed to wear masks correctlychildren excluded from suspected novel coronavirus infection in convalescence released from quarantine for negative virus nucleic acid tests 2 or more times or in full recovery from covid-19 infection 1 the indications for digestive endoscopy must be strictly followed 2 endoscopy should be performed in an isolated room medical personnel should be protected

purposes 2 endoscopy should not be performed for children with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection in the digestive endoscopy center and 3 if necessary endoscopy should be performed in a standard isolation ward for children suspected to have or diagnosed with covid-19 infection second-level protection measures should be taken during consultation and third-level protection measures should be taken during endoscopy protective equipment should be in a mode of single person for single use and disposable and rooms and equipment should be disinfected in a timely manner according to the requirements of infectious diseasesafter endoscopy or contact with childrens saliva gastric juice or other secretions hands should be washed with flowing water or sanitized with fast-drying hand
