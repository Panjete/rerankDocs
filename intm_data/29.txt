application of artificial intelligence in covid-19 drug repurposing sweta mohanty md harun ai rashid mayank mridul chandana mohanty swati swayamsiddha   novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 continues to spread aggressively with a mortality rate of about 7 213 countries and territories around the world have reported a total of 7817195 confirmed cases with a death toll of about 430397 it started with patients reporting pneumonia-like symptoms of unknown etiology in the wuhan district of china hubei province and was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 12 sars-cov-2 is a class of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense rna genome they come under the betacoronavirus group having the same phylogenetic similarity with the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 13 thus it is the 3rd coronavirus epidemic and as a result of evolution of the virus the spread of covid-19 is more severe than that of the previous sars-cov and the mers-cov 2 the sars-cov-2 pandemic has forced researchers to invent new strategies for rapid antiviral treatment host-based antiviral agents target host cellular machinery essential for viral infections or innate immune responses to interfere with viral pathogenesis 4 it can be augmented by employing well-validated drug discovery approaches there are two basic strategies in drug discovery conventional drug development and drug repositioning 5 besides the success rate being very low the conventional way typically takes 1015 years is very expensive and needs high investments drug repositioning instead reuses old drugs for exploring new therapeutics making it more efficient economical and riskless 6 more than 80 pioneering clinical trials have been instigated at present to test coronavirus treatment including potential old drugs and investigational new drugs 7 recycling and reusing old drugs recovering shelved drugs and increasing patients lives makes drug repositioning an appealing system of drug discovery it requires a thorough in-depth knowledge of present practices acquired by assessing both biological and pharmaceutical learning and interpreted mechanism-of-action of drugs in this regard the pharmaceutical industry is also looking for novel leading-edge technologies to track monitor and restrict the dissemination of covid-19 disease 28 ai is one such parallel technology that can provide support against this virus by population screening medical help notification and suggestions about infection control ai is also implemented in the field design through inception of learning-prediction model and performs a swift virtual screening to accurately display the congruent outputs with a drug repositioning strategy ai can briefly screen drugs that have potential to fight minacious diseases such as covid-19 being an evidence-based medical tool this technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery planning design treatment and outline follow-ups of the covid-19 patients this review describes the current application of ai in drug repurposing for treating covid-19 pandemic drug discovery is a high-risk lengthy and expensive process 910 according to a report by the eastern research group erg while it takes 1015 years to develop a new molecular entity the success rate is only 201 6 the concept of drug repurposing reuses old drugs for the treatment of a never-considered therapeutic indication it is an experimental approach of identifying the pre-approved discontinued shelved and investigational drugs for authorized restatement for the treatment of other diseases conventional drug development usually includes five stages i discovery and development ii pre-clinical research iii clinical research iv fda review and v fda post-market safety monitoring and development however there are only four steps in drug repurposing i compound identification ii compound acquisition iii clinical research and iv fda post-market safety monitoring and development fig 1
 6 a repositioned drug goes directly to preclinical testing and clinical trials omitting the initial steps thus narrowing down the risks and lowering the costs fundamental principle in drug repurposing is that a common molecular pathway is associated and accountable for numerable diseases and a multitude of explicit information that is accessible on the formulation dose toxicity pharmacology and clinical trial data of the authorized approved shelved or discontinued drugs 11 drug repurposing in this article refers to the use of existing approved drugs for the treatment of a never-considered therapeutic indication - in this case covid-19 the discovery and development of new molecular entities being lengthy time-killing and high-priced for clinical trials to earn regulatory authorizations or sanctions the momentary passage thus to potential treatments is the repurposing repositioning of prevailing approved drugs for the treatment of covid-19 in this context chloroquine cq and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine hcq have been reported in the treatment of viral infection these drugs have antimalarial activity and also showed in vitro treatment against covid -19 12 similarly an antiviral drug remdesivir primarily used in the treatment of ebola virus clinical studies exposed new successful effects against covid-19 in vitro it is an adenosine analogue basically integrates into nascent viral rna chains and shows in early termination 13 lopinavir and ritonavir were used in the ministration of covid-19 patients these two antiviral agents mainly affect proteolysis in coronavirus replication cycle 14 ribavirin is an analogue of ribonucleic and inhibitor of rna polymerization this drug has shown in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 in preclinical studies 1 furthermore tocilizumab an immunosuppressive drug was also used in the treatment of covid-19 patients in vivo in china this is chiefly employed to aid rheumatoid arthritis tested in covid-19 patients the drug successfully mitigates the clinical symptoms of viral infection but the numbers of patients investigated in the study were very few 15 the anti-flu drug of japan is revealed significant results in clinical trials over 340 patients 16 in china this drug is accepted for the treatment of influenza and also shown to be efficient against a different type of viruses including sars-cov-2 similarly ascorbic acid vitamin c combination with other antiviral drug has shown to be supportive in the treatment of covid-19 patients in this context more studies are suggested for a future drug against covid-19 17 the main hindrance in drug repositioning is diagnosing and identifying the unique drug-disease relationship to address this issue a variety of approaches have been developed including computational approaches such as ai biological experimental approaches and mixed approaches thus there are chances that the application of the ai approach in drug discovery is feasible 18 researchers have found many similarities between the covid-19 virus and the 2003 sars virus and based on the existing data that caused sars ai learning models can be created to predict drug structures that could potentially treat covid -19 19 notwithstanding effectively affirmed repurposed drugs there is a requirement for recognizing more repurposed drugs 19 ai and machine learning ml can support this procedure by rapidly recognizing drugs having adequacy against covid-19 and thus overcome any barrier between a large number of repurposed drugs laboratoryclinical testing and final drug authorization a good amount of information discharged by different health agencies and organizations is accessible on open stages 20 ai likewise contains a subfield called ml which utilizes factual strategies with the capacity to learn with or without being modified by an external user machine learning is divided into supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning 21 supervised learning contains characterization and relapse strategies where the prescient model is created dependent on the information from information and yield sources i e output unsupervised learning includes bunching strategies by gathering and deciphering information dependent on input information only another field of ml is deep learning it uses ai neural network with multiple hidden layers apart from the input and output layer deep learning permits machines to take care of complex issues in any event when utilizing an informational index that is exceptionally differing and unstructured the more deep learning calculations learn the better they perform the development of dl was seen with the expanding measure of information and the nonstop development of computer power the striking distinction that dl makes is the adaptability in the design of neural systems such as repetitive neural networks rnn convolutional neural networks cnn deep belief networks dbn and completely associated feed-forward systems the whole explanation will be better understood by fig 2
 it presents the ai-empowered drug repurposing strategy we need a repurposed drug database open chemicaldrug database as an input to the model then different algorithms could be applied to the input and the required drug could be obtained 22 the best and the truly necessary technique during circumstances is to order this unique medication information with the goal that ai scientists can apply their calculations to determine noteworthy bits of knowledge for this the world offices and policymakers need to step up to push huge pharma organizations and exploration labs to unite with littler examination associations and pool information sources to foresee increasingly exact outcomes specialists need arrangements of good information which is as of now not accessible and are therefore constrained by lack of data or too much noisy data associations over the globe are taking vital activities to utilize ai for testing which is empowering be that as it may there is a requirement for progressively symptomatic testing 8 a few associations have begun to use these advancements to quicken covid-19 medication disclosure and better fathom how the resistant framework battles the infection toward the beginning of april pharmaceutical organizations glaxosmithkline gsk and vir biotechnology joined forces to progress coronavirus treatment advancement utilizing computerized reasoning and crispr furthermore in the scholarly area the harvard t chan school of public health as of late united with the human vaccines project to dispatch the human immunomics initiative which uses man-made reasoning models to quicken antibodies for a scope of infections including covid-19 23 a group from southern illinois university siu as of late built up an information representation device that uses gps data to show users the locations of known covid-19 cases google and apple have likewise collaborated to build up a contact following application powered by bluetooth innovation these methods may prove effective in the data collection in a great and accurate amount 23 organizations are running experimentation explores different avenues regarding effectively approved drugs having built up wellbeing profiles in people based on fundamental comprehension of the infection with regards to covid-19 hydroxychloroquine endorsed to treat malaria and remdesivir for ebola are the two most popular instances of this up until now 24 so the data set of the effectiveness of these medicines may be a good input for an ai model the organizations which are utilizing ai for repurposing existing medications for covid-19 are listed in table 1
 this article explores the recent advances of ai-empowered drug repurposing for covid-19 in the age of big data drug repurposing can be done efficiently by using deep learning methods the ai-based drug repurposing is a cheaper faster and effective approach and can minimize the failures in clinical trials the repurposed drug can directly enter the advanced phase for trial without the initial trials and toxicity tests though presently the ai-empowered drug repurposing is in its nascent stage this approach is a promising solution for the development of potential drugs for the cure of covid-19 the computational intelligence aided drug molecule design and re-positioning of drug molecules can help in the prediction of excellent anti-viral therapeutics however the prediction efficiency can increase with a systematic training database and development of relevant learning algorithms with technological advancements in ai coupled with increased computational power the ai-empowered drug repurposing can prove beneficial in the covid-19 scenario all authors have participated in a conception and design or analysis and interpretation of the data b drafting the article

odisha  saverunner a network-based algorithm for drug repurposing and its application to covid-19 giulia fiscon   federica conte lorenzo farina paola paci  the novelty of new human coronavirus covid-19sars-cov-2 and the lack of effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed to fight this worldwide pandemic many of these strategies rely on the repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery in this study we presented a new network-based algorithm for drug repositioning called saverunner searching off-label drug and network which predicts drug-disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods specifically we applied saverunner on a panel of 14 selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes and that have been found to be related to covid-19 for genetic similarity ie sars comorbidity eg cardiovascular diseases or for their association to drugs tentatively repurposed to treat covid-19 eg malaria hiv rheumatoid arthritis focusing specifically on sars subnetwork we identified 282 repurposable drugs including some the most rumored off-label drugs for chloroquine hydroxychloroquine tocilizumab heparin as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs hydroxychloroquine chloroquine lopinavir ritonavir remdesivir actually used in clinical practice furthermore to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation experiments we prioritized 24 potential anti-sars-cov repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity values these topranked drugs include ace-inhibitors monoclonal antibodies eg anti-ifn anti-tnf anti-il12 anti-il1 anti-il6 and thrombin inhibitors finally our findings were in-silico validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis which confirmed that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect against human coronavirus infections the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by an enveloped positive-strand rna virus named sars-cov-2 which affects the respiratory system and whose genome has been likened to the previously identified sars-cov strain responsible for sars outbreak in 2003 1  unfortunately the world population is completely immune-nave and therefore vulnerable against this new coronavirus which has rapidly spread becoming a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality 2-4  while covid-19 lockdowns are easing across the world main concerns come from its arrival in africa where the countries are unprepared to counteract the storms outburst of the new coronavirus and 12 billion people are at tremendous risk 5  for example kenya has only 200 intensive care beds for its entire population of 50 million whereas united states has 34 beds for every 100000 people countries like mali have only a few ventilators for millions of people health facilities are overcrowded and understaffed yet in many countries throughout africa people live together in close quarters often without access to clean running water that makes social distancing and frequent handwashing the only possible prevention strategy all but impossible 5  given that the covid-19 pandemic demands the rapid identification of repurposable drug candidates to fight the disease progression in the short term and to prevent it from happening in the future drug repurposing is a recent drug development strategy used to identify novel uses for drugs approved by the us food and drug administration fda outside the scope of their original medical indication 6  it aims at establishing whether an old drug can be reused for new therapeutic purposes representing a faster and cheaper alternative to de novo drug discovery process which generally takes 12-15 years and 2-3 billion dollars from production to approval passing through the various phases of preclinical and clinical trials 6  thus far several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of covid-19 but none have yet been shown to be efficacious 78  currently the most promising therapeutic candidate made available under an emergency-use authorization by the fda is remdesivir it is an inhibitor of the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase with proven ability to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro 9  in fact according to recent preliminary results of randomized clinical trials remdesivir has been shown to be superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection 10  however despite the use of remdesivir the mortality remains high indicating that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient to continue to improve patient outcomes in covid-19 combinations of antiviral agents or antiviral agents in combination with other therapeutic approaches should be evaluated by future strategies very promising insights comes from the new emerging field of network medicine 1112  which applies tools and concepts from network theory to elucidate the relation between perturbations on the molecular level and phenotypic disease manifestations the basic premise of this exercise is that the human interactome ie the cellular network of all physical molecular interactions can be interpreted as a map and diseases as local perturbations 13  yet the molecular determinants of a given disease disease genes are not to be randomly scattered but co-localize and agglomerate in specific regions disease modules of the interactome and perturbations in these disease modules may contribute to the pathobiological phenotype 12  from a network medicine perspective also the action of drugs can be interpreted as a local perturbation of the interactome and thus for a drug to be on-target effective against a specific disease or to cause off-target adverse effects its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of the corresponding disease module network-based approaches marrying this philosophy can aid in identifying the specific interactome neighborhood that is perturbed in a certain disease andor for the effect of a certain drug and guide the search for therapeutic targets identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurposing candidates 14-18  here we presented saverunner searching off-label drug and network a new network-medicinebased algorithm for drug repurposing it constructs a bipartite drug-disease network by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods saverunner yielded a high accuracy in the identification of well-known drug indications thus revealing itself as a powerful tool to rapidly highlight potential novel medical indications for various drugs which are already approved and used in clinical practice against the new human coronavirus 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 first of all we would like to thank the health care workers that in this dramatic moment are on the front lines giving everything to fight this novel coronavirus pandemic we would like to sincerely thank dr gianpiero doffizi for his precious advice on drugs and drugs combination to include in our analysis and for his important help in the interpretation of our results supplementarytable1xlsx the table is composed of two separate sheets the first sheet reports the diseases analyzed in our study with the corresponding number of disease-causing genes obtained from phenopedia database the second sheet reports the fda-approved drugs obtained from drugbank and processed in our analysis with the corresponding number of target proteins supplementarytable2xlsx the table is composed of three separate sheets the first sheet reports the bipartite sars-drug subnetwork released by saverunner the second sheet reports the bipartite covid-19-drug subnetwork released by saverunner the third sheet reports the lists of specific and common candidate repurposable drugs for covid-19 and sars  saverunner algorithm requires in input a list of drug targets and a list of disease genes to evaluate the extent to which a given drug can repositioned to treat a given disease in the present study disease-associated genes were downloaded from phenopedia 19  which provides a disease-centered view of genetic association studies whereas drug-target associations were obtained from drugbank 20  which collects huge amount of drug-related data recently enabling the discovery and repurposing of a relevant number of existing drugs to treat rare and newly identified diseases 6 14 figure 1a  we tested the performance of saverunner on a panel of 14 diseases that have been found to be related to covid-19 for genetic similarity comorbidity or for their association to drugs with the potential to shorten the recovery time for seriously ill covid-19 patients thus we included severe acute respiratory syndrome sars since it is caused by the coronavirus with the highest nucleotide sequence identity with sars-cov-2 16 21  unlike covid-19 for which there is still a partial knowledge of its associated disease genes sars has been widely studied and a reliable list of the its molecular determinants is available in the most common databases of human genetic associations 19  yet we comprehended cardiovascular diseases diabetes and hypertension whose comorbidity in covid-19 patients is well documented 22 23  in addition we included other viral infections ie malaria hiv and ebola and immune disorders ie rheumatoid arthritis since drugs that have been authorized for their treatment ie chloroquinehydroxychloroquine lopinavirritonavir remdesivir and tocilizumab respectively are being investigated worldwide for their potential to treat coronavirus disease covid-19 7 9 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  for what concerns drug-target associations we assembled target information for a total of 1875 fdaapproved drugs in addition we considered in our input list of drug targets also the combination of remdesivir with other four antiviral agents ie hydroxycloriquine chloriquine lopinavir and ritonavir referred as 5-cocktail as well as the combination of two of them ie lopinavir and ritonavir referred as kaletra whose antiviral action against coronavirus infections has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo studies 31 32  in fact despite significant progress in the covid-19 management pointing to remdesivir as the most promising therapeutic candidate the mortality remains high indicating that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient and combinations of antiviral agents should be evaluated by future strategies to improve patient outcomes in covid-19 10  the complete lists of the analyzed diseases and drugs are provided in supplementary table 1 the rationale behind saverunner algorithm lies on the hypothesis that for a drug to be effective against a specific disease its associated targets drug module and the disease-specific associated genes disease module should be nearby in the human interactome 14 figure 1b  to quantify the vicinity between drug and disease modules saverunner implements a novel network similarity measure where p is the network proximity measure defined in 14  that represents the average shortest path length between drug targets in the drug module and the nearest disease genes in the disease module  is the quality cluster score is   and are the steepness and the midpoint of   respectively see materials and methods to assess the statistical significance of this new defined network-based similarity measure saverunner applies a degreepreserving randomization procedure expecting a p-value  005 for proximal drug and disease modules the novelty of our approach resides in having implemented a procedure to prioritize the predicted off-label drug indications for a given disease see materials and methods section this prioritization procedure exploits a clustering analysis to reward associations between drugs and diseases belonging to the same network cluster based on the assumption that if a drug and a disease group together is more likely that the drug can be effectively repurposed for that disease in this sense we say that drugs and disease that are members of the same group cluster are more similar to each other than to members of other groups clusters saverunner algorithm releases as output a weighted bipartite drug-disease network in which one set of nodes corresponds to drugs and the other one corresponds to diseases a link between a drug and a disease occurs if the corresponding drug targets and disease genes are nearby in the interactome more than expected by chance p-value  005 and the weight of their interaction corresponds to the new defined network-based similarity measure in this study the final drug-disease network was composed of a total of 1682 nodes ie 14 diseases associated to 1668 drugs and 7177 edges this drug-disease network was naturally rendered as a matrix reporting the 14 diseases on the rows and the 1668 drugs on the columns figure 2  labeled with their original medical indication according to the therapeutic target database ttd each matrix cell was colored according to the corresponding similarity value of a given drug-disease pair shades of yellow denote drug-associated targets more proximal high similarity to the disease-associated genes in the human interactome whereas shades of blue denote drug targets more distal low similarity to the disease genes  figure 2  for elucidating drugsdiseases relatedness in terms of network similarity we computed a hierarchical biclustering on the drug-disease similarity matrix this analysis pointed out two main disease clusters one including sars rds multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis malaria and viral infection diseases magenta box in figure 2  the other one including cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors ie diabetes mellitus and hypertension green box in figure 2  as proof of validity of saverunner among the predicted drug-disease associations we found several already known associations for example tocilizumab interferon-beta 1ab chloroquine hydroxychloroquine lopinavirritonavir resulted to be significantly associated p-value  005 with the diseases for which they were approved ie rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis malaria and hiv infection respectively in total we found 41 host proteins associated with sars-cov and their specific subnetwork within the human interactome is shown in figure 3a  by mapping the known drug-target network into the sars-cov-host interactome we revealed that 21 out of 41 51 light blue nodes in figure 3a figure 3b  mirroring the enrichment results found for the total 41 sars-cov-associated disease genes figure 3c  the high druggability of sars-cov-host interactome and the relevance of the pathways in which the 21 druggable sars-cov-associated disease genes are involved strongly supports a drug repurposing strategy for potential treatment of covid-19 by specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with sars the remaining 20 non-targetable sars-cov-associated disease genes include proteins eg cd14 ifna1 ifnb1 il4 il10 ccl5 having key roles in the immune-inflammatory response to viral infection as well this strongly supports a network-based view of drug action according to which most disease phenotypes are difficult to reverse through the use of a single magic bullet that is an intervention that affects a single node in the network and encourages to inspect all the molecules that are situated in the neighborhood of the targetable proteins leading to also detect possible side-effects 12  in total saverunner identified 282 repurposable drugs that were significantly associated p-value  005 with the sars-cov infection supplementary table 2  figure 4a illustrates a sketch of sars drugdisease network in which sars is connected to the other analyzed diseases via the high-confidence predicted drugs with their original medical indications that could be repurposed for potential sars fighting this network is composed of two independent sets of nodes one set corresponds to 13 diseases ie sars and the other 12 diseases sharing at least one drug with sars represented as red circles and whose size scales with their degree the other one corresponds to the 66 fda-approved non-sars drugs for which known therapeutic indications were available from ttd or to the drugs combination proposed as new potential medical indication colored accordingly two nodes of the two independent sets were connected whether the network similarity of the drug targets and disease genes in the human interactome was statistically significant p-value  005 looking at figure 4a  it clearly emerges that there exist several candidate repurposable drugs for treatment of sars among them we pointed out the 5-cocktail adjusted similarity  089 p-value  0036 that appeared as a promising candidate for targeting sars showing a quite high network similarity in total among the candidate repurposable drugs for sars with an already known medical indication we found 16 drugs indicated for hypertension treatment including enalapril which is also the top potential anti- hydroxycloriquine adjusted similarity  051 p-value  185 10 -6  and 2 drugs for influenza  figure 4b  by analyzing the distribution of all the known medical indications associated to the drugs shared between sars infection and each analyzed disease hypertension-and cardiac-associated drugs appeared as highly frequent drugs followed by rheumatoid arthritis-and respiratory disease-associated ones  figure 4c  this findings appear in accordance with the fact that patients with sars-cov-2 infection also showed potential hypertension and cardiac injuries including arrhythmia and myocardial dysfunction 22 23 33 34  this could be owed to the disruption of the subtle balance between angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 ace1 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 identified as functional receptor of both sars-covsars-cov-2 for host cell entry 35 and normally devoted to present various cardiovascular protective effects 33  in order to validate the 282 anti-sars repurposable drugs predicted by saverunner we performed a gene set enrichment analysis gsea as in 16  by using transcriptome data of sars-cov infected cells as gene signature for sars the gene expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the connectivity map cmap database were exploited to obtain drug signatures and thus to calculate a gsea score for each drug as an indication of in-silico validation in particular for each sars dataset we selected drugs with a score  0 in order to focus on those drugs able to have a potential treatment effect on genes that are hallmark for that phenotype the assigned gsea score ranging from 0 to 2 corresponded to the number of datasets satisfying this criterion for a specific drug the gsea analysis validated a total of 61 out the 282 candidate drugs to be repositioned against sars infection including 26 with a gsea score of 2 and 35 with a gsea score equal to 1 supplementary table   2  in this study we focused on sars disease which is caused by the coronavirus having the higher genetic similarity with sars-cov-2 16 21 and for which the specific disease genes are known conversely given the novelty of the new coronavirus covid-19 in the spectrum of human disease the knowledge of the covid-19-associated genes is far from completeness however a study has been recently published where the authors identified 332 human proteins interacting with 26 sars-cov-2 proteins by using affinity purification mass spectrometry 36  although the authors verified that these proteins were preferentially highly expressed in lung tissue typical environment where the virus causes a major damage this study has been carried out on human hek293t kidney cells that does not represent the primary physiological site of infection for a more generalizable understanding of human coronaviruses infection we completed our analysis by applying saverunner on these the 332 human proteins preliminarily associated to sars-cov-2 the obtained results are encouraging and appears in accordance with the analysis carried out on sars-cov indeed by performing a hierarchical clustering on the network of predicted drug-disease associations we found covid-19 in the same cluster of sars rds multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis malaria and viral infection diseases figure 5a  this is in accordance with recent studies that are attempting to repurpose for covid-19 treatment drugs approved to treat other viral infections such as influenza malaria hiv and ebola or immune-related disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 9 24 25 26 28 29 37  the list of network-predicted drugs potentially able to treat sars-cov-2 infection contains a total of 98 drugs including 54 ie 55 covid-19 specific and 44 ie 45 in common with the 282 candidate repurposing candidates shared between sars-cov-2 an sars-cov is also reflected in the result of the greedy clustering algorithm implemented by saverunner which places covid-19 and sars together in the cluster with the highest quality cluster score we then investigated whether the network-predicted repurposable drugs could counteract the gene expression perturbations caused by sars-cov-2 ie if they could up-regulate genes down-regulated by the infection or viceversa to verify that we performed the gsea analysis by using as covid-19 gene signature the 120 differentially expressed genes in sars-cov-2-infected a549 cells reported in 38 and as drug signatures the gene expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the cmap database 39  interestingly this analysis revealed that 24 out of 98 candidate drugs to be repositioned for covid-19 treatment achieved the highest gsea score in particular 14 of them encompassing lopinavir were included in the 54 specific-sars-cov-2 predicted drugs supplementary table 2 and figure 5b  in a recent study 18  the authors exploited the new knowledge of sars-cov-2 host interactome 36 and integrated several network-based drug repurposing strategies to prioritize 81 promising repurposing candidates against covid-19 the overlap between these 81 repurposable drugs and the 98 ones predicted by saverunner is of 5 drugs ie isoniazid lopinavir romidepsin sulfinpyrazone tadalafil in order to predict potential comorbidity patterns among all the diseases analyzed in this study for each disease module corresponding to the 15 analyzed disorders we computed the non-euclidean separation distance which measures the modules overlap 40  where    is the network proximity defined as and    is the shortest distance between disease gene of module and disease gene of module  a positive value for the separation measure indicates that two disease modules are topologically well-separated in the human interactome whereas a negative value for the separation measure indicates that two disease modules are located in the same network neighborhood and thus overlap we found that sars-cov disease module directly overlapped with rds and influenza disease modules s  0 and appeared to be closest to malaria smallest s followed by cardiomyopathies figure 6a  on the other hand by using sars-cov-2 disease genes we found that the covid-19 disease module did not directly overlap with any disease module here analyzed  figure 6b  however among the closest diseases smallest s we found cardiovascular diseases ie cardiomyopathies arrhythmia heart arrest whose comorbidity in covid-19 patients has been already discussed 22 23  in the last few years several computational network-based methods have been proposed to predict direct drug-disease associations for drug repositioning 41 42 43 44 45 46  among them the mbirw algorithm adopts adopted an effective mechanism to measure similarity for drugs and diseases and applied a bi-random walk birw algorithm to predict potential new indications for existing drugs 46  this methodology has been shown to outperform other well-known network-based prediction methods 15 47 48 in correctly predicting true drugdisease associations these captivating results prompted us to implement a birw-based algorithm see materials and methods against which we compared the performance of saverunner the effectiveness of the drug-disease predictions provided by birw and saverunner were evaluated and compared in terms of receiver operating characteristic roc probability curves with their corresponding area under the curve auc see materials and methods in particular we found that saverunner yielded over 70 accuracy auc  073 for identifying well-known drug-disease relationships and overcame the one obtained by the birw-based algorithm auc  059 in other words there is 73 chance that saverunner algorithm will be able to distinguish between positive class known drug-disease associations and negative class unknown drug-disease associations against the 59 of the birw-based algorithm thus far no proven effective therapies for the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 exist and the majority of available data are based on expert opinions and anecdotal experiences 49 reports from china suggest that chloroquine has shown a superiority in reducing both the severity and the duration of clinical disease without significant adverse events in almost one hundred patients 26 51 52  in light of this results an expert consensus group in china has recommended chloroquine for covid-19 treatment 26  hydroxychloroquine brand name plaquenil is an analogue of chloroquine which was demonstrated to be much less toxic than chloroquine in animals and with similar in vitro efficacy on sars-cov-2 25 27 lopinavirritonavir brand name kaletra is a well-known protease inhibitor which has been widely used for many years for the treatment of hiv infection compared to remdesivir lopinavirritonavir has the advantage that it is widely available and has an established toxicity and drug-drug interactions profile its one of the most promising monoclonal antibodies under investigation for the management of covid-19 is tocilizumab tcz specifically tcz is an anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody that inhibits signal transduction by binding sil-6r and mil-6r currently tcz is licensed for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis but several studies in china showed a possible correlation of massive inflammation and severe lung damage on the rapid evolution of fatal pneumonia indeed in covid-19 patients significant differences in il-6 plasmatic levels were observed at different stage of disease with a higher expression in severe cases 37  despite the lack of clinical trials on tcz efficacy and safety for covid-19 treatment off-label tcz has been used as potential treatment strategy in severe and critical covid-19 patients currently in italy a multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with covid-19 pneumonia is ongoing another remarkable candidate for the treatment of covid-19 is lmwh with the aim to improve the coagulation dysfunction of covid-19 really during the course of sars-cov-2 infection an increased incidence of acute pulmonary embolism episodes was detected these were often covid-19 patients with risk factors for embolism increased d-dimer and deterioration of general conditions and respiratory failure recently tong n et al 53 showed that anticoagulant therapy mainly with lmwh appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe covid-19 patients meeting criteria of the sepsis-induced coagulopathy score or with markedly elevated d-dimer however its efficacy remains to be validated in large clinical trials interestingly lmwh seems exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing il-6 and increasing lymphocyte  so that the potential of lmwh could be to mitigate cytokine storm in severe covid-19 patients to complete the clinical landscape of potential adjunctive therapy for covid-19 we mention also the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins obtained from recovered patients 57  the rationale for this treatment is that antibodies from recovered patients may help the immune clearance of sars-cov-2 in conclusion several drugs demonstrate in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 of these several repurposed currently randomized clinical trials have not proven that any of these drugs are undoubtedly effective in this study we developed a novel network-based algorithm for drug repurposing called saverunner with the aim to offer a promising framework to efficiently screen potential novel indications for currently marketed drugs against covid-19 our findings in accordance with several recent works 14 16 58  suggested that the discovery of efficacious repurposable drugs or drug combinations could benefit from the exploration of the relationship between drug targets and the disease genes in the human interactome the novelty of saverunner relies on the definition of a new network-based similarity measure which quantifies the vicinity between drug and disease modules and considers the drug-disease network modular structure to reward predicted associations between drugs and diseases that are located in the same network neighborhoods focusing on sars disease which is caused by the coronavirus having the higher genetic similarity with sars-cov-2 16 21 and for which the specific disease genes are known we identified 282 candidate repurposable drugs among them we recovered some of the most rumored off-label drugs like chloroquine hydroxycloriquine tocilizumab and heparin while lopinavirritonavir and remdesivir were not found to be significantly associated with sars their combination together with chloroquine and hydroxycloriquine here referred as 5-cocktail was predicted as a promising anti-sars-cov repurposable drug although all the 282 repurposable drugs predicted by saverunner warrant to be explored a prioritization of these drugs according to the decreasing value of their network similarity value with sars may offer the possibility to maximize the efficiency of subsequent experimental screening and clinical trial validation this does not mean that drugs located at a lower-ranking have no potential efficacy or must be a priori excluded from further exploration thus we found that the 95 th percentile of the similarity values distribution includes ace-inhibitors ie  as indication of in-silico validation of the 282 candidate repurposable drugs predicted by saverunner we performed a gsea analysis that allowed to investigate whether these repositioning candidates have potential treatment effect against sars-cov infection the gsea analysis validated a total of 61 out the 282 anti-sars repurposable drugs among the drugs achieving highest gsea scores we found some of the ace-inhibitors above-mentioned ie enalapril benazepril quinapril fosinopril rescinnamine as well as ace-inhibitors with multiple targets ie perindopril captopril moexipril ramipril and chloroquine in addition this analysis came up other interesting but less obvious drugs falling far outside antiviral use such as ruxolitinib lovastatin and a group of h1-antihistamines ie loratadine fexofenadine levocetirizine desloratadine clemastine ketotifen diphenhydramine cetirizine ruxolitinib is a potent and selective janus-associated kinase jak inhibitor approved for treatment of myelofibrosis but thanks to its powerful anti-inflammatory effect it could be likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines typically observed in patients with covid-19 68 69  lovastatin is widely prescribed to reduce the levels cholesterol in the blood and prevent cardiovascular diseases experimental evidence suggested that statin-induced reduction of cholesterol in the plasma membrane results in lower viral titers and failure to internalize the virus 70  h1-antihistamines are mostly used to treat allergic reactions but they potentially could have beneficial antiinflammatory effects on immune dysregulation during covid 19 infection indeed histamine is a biologically active substance that potentiates the inflammatory and immune responses of the body regulates physiological function in the gut and acts as a neurotransmitter notably among the repurposable drugs against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 both predicted by saverunner and validated by gsea analysis we found 10 common off-label drugs encompassing ace inhibitors ie enalapril and quinapril and antihistamines ie cetirizine and fexofenadine moreover among repurposable drugs validated by the gsea analysis as potential treatment effect against sars-cov-2 infection we found the protease inhibitor lopinavir moving beyond the one drug one target vision prompted us to explore all the molecules that are situated in the interactome neighborhood of the drugs targetable proteins which may be altered by the drug activity as well as may cause side-effects  figure 7  we interestingly observe that all drug subnetworks include genes involved in the immune-inflammatory some drugs are characterized by highly complex interaction networks whereas others like the case of remdesivir seem to have a poorly connected substructure however it is worth noting that the observed network complexity does not scale with the potential drug effectiveness the lack of interactions may be likely ascribable both to the current incompleteness of the human interactome and to the shortage of drugtarget information as in the case of remdesivir which being designed to target specifically virus proteins little is known about its human targetable proteins leading to a less wired subgraph this is not the case of the heparin subnetwork figure 7f  where the highly complexity in its interaction network perfectly matches its versatile role of anticoagulant anti-inflammatory and antiviral drug turning out in a strong multifactorial impact in the new human coronavirus 55  the human protein-protein interactome was downloaded from the supplementary data of 14  disease-associated genes were downloaded from phenopedia 19  which provides a disease-centered view of genetic association studies collecting by the online human genome epidemiology huge encyclopedia 78  the updated version of phenopedia released 27-04-2020 collects gene associations for 3255 diseases among them we selected a panel of 14 diseases of interest with their associated genes supplementary table   1  drug-target interactions were acquired from drugbank 20  which is a comprehensive freely accessible online database containing information on drugs and drug targets 80 database in particular for remdesivir an anti-virus drug designed to target specifically virus proteins we extracted its human target information from ttd the known drug medical indications were obtained from ttd 79  whose last version was released on 11 nov saverunner searching off-label drug and network is a network-based algorithm for drug repurposing that taking as input a list of drug targets and disease genes constructs a drug-disease network with predicted drug-disease associations by performing the steps that will be next discussed figure 8  in order to investigate the extent to which disease and drug modules are close in the human interactome saverunner implements the network-based proximity measure defined as 14  which is the average shortest path length between drug targets in the drug module and the nearest disease genes in the disease module figure 1b  to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed network proximity between the two modules and  saverunner builds a reference distance distribution corresponding to the expected distance between two randomly selected groups of proteins with the same size and degree distribution of the original sets of disease proteins and drug targets in the human interactome this procedure is repeated 1000 times and the z statistics together with the corresponding p-value is computed by using the mean and the standard deviation of the reference distance distribution step 2 computation of network similarity the network proximity measure is then translated in a similarity measure assuming values in the range 0-1 where null similarity means that the corresponding disease and drug modules are very distal in the human interactome ie is maximum whereas maximum similarity means that the corresponding disease and drug modules are very proximal in the human interactome ie equal to zero in order to filter out statistically insignificant drug-disease associations a significance level for the p-values is set it means that given a disease a and a drug b if the p-value associated to their distance in the human interactome is smaller of the chosen significance level the probability that the off-label drug b would be effective for this disease a is greater than expected by chance in our analysis predicted drug-disease associations with a p-value  005 were selected next saverunner performs a cluster analysis to detect groups of drugs and diseases in such a way that members in the same group cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other groups clusters to do that saverunner exploits a cluster detection algorithm based on the greedy optimization of the network modularity 81  specifically modularity measures the strength of network division into clusters ie networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within clusters but sparse connections between nodes in different clusters the greedy clustering algorithm was adopted in view of its good performance and high speed in detecting community structure from very large networks 81  the quality of each cluster is evaluated by saverunner by computing the following quality cluster   score where denotes the total weight of edges within the cluster denotes the total weight of edges connecting this cluster to the rest of network and is a penalty term which considers the node density within the cluster step 5 adjustment of network similarity the quality cluster score serves to reward associations between drugs and diseases belonging to the same cluster based on the assumption that if a drug and a disease group together is more likely that the drug can be effectively repurposed for that disease in this sense we say that drug and the disease that are members of the same cluster tend to be more similar and this translates into the following adjustment for the similarity thus whether two nodes fall in the same cluster their similarity value increases by a factor proportional to the score of the cluster which they belong otherwise whether two nodes do not fall in the same cluster is set to zero and their similarity value does not change step 6 normalization of network similarity to bound the similarity measure defined in eq 1 to values that monotonically increase from 0 to 1 saverunner performed a normalization procedure by applying the following sigmoid function where is the adjusted similarity measure eq 1 d is the sigmoid midpoint ie the value at which the function approaches to 05 c is the sigmoid steepness we set  max   2 and  10 at the end of this step saverunner offers a list of predictedprioritized associations between drugs and diseases as a weighted bipartite drug-disease network in which one set of nodes corresponds to drugs and the other one corresponds to diseases a link between a drug and a disease occurs if the corresponding drug targets and disease genes are nearby in the interactome more than expected by chance p-value  005 and the weight of their interaction corresponds to the adjusted and normalized similarity value the effectiveness of predicted drug-disease associations provided by the saverunner algorithm was evaluated in terms of the receiver operating characteristic roc probability curve analysis the drugdisease associations were ranked according to increasing p-values and a real association was assigned according to ttd information 1 if the predicted drug-disease association is known 0 otherwise for a specified p-value threshold the true positive rate ie sensitivity was calculated as the fraction of known associations that are correctly predicted while the false positive rate ie 1-specificity was computed as the fraction of unknown associations that are predicted the roc probability curve was drawn based on these measures at different thresholds and the corresponding area under the curve auc was computed higher the auc better the algorithm is at distinguishing between two classes ie known drug-disease associations versus unknown drug-disease associations inspired by an already existing algorithm of drug repurposing called mbirw 46  we exploited a bi-random walk-based birw approach to infer potential reuse for existing drugs we started from the known drugdisease associations available on the ttd 19 figure 9a  in analogy with 46  the matrices and were adjusted based on the known drug-disease associations the underlying hypothesis is that drug disease pairs whose similarity value is greater of what expected by chance are more likely to share common diseases drugs from the adjusted matrix  a weighted drug similarity network was built in which nodes are the approved drugs and an edge occurs between two nodes if they share at least one target gene with a weight given by the corresponding element of the matrix  likewise from the adjusted matrix  a weighted disease similarity network was built in which nodes are the diseases and an edge occurs between two diseases if they share at least one disease gene with a weight given by the corresponding element of the matrix  next new drug-disease associations were predicted through an iterative random walk process on drug and disease similarity networks simultaneously denoting with the parameters and the walks in the drug network left walks and in the disease network right walks the bi-random walk can be described by the following equations where 0 denotes the drug-disease association at  0 matrix  while and represent the predicted drug-disease associations at iteration starting from left or right respectively the hypothesis behind is that an association between a drug r1 and a disease d1 can be added following these two avenues  figure 9b  1 a random walker starts from a random vertex r1 of the drug similarity network and in each step walks to one of the neighboring vertices for instance r2 with a known or previously predicted association with d1 with a probability proportional to the weight of the edge traversed ie the corresponding element of  2 a random walker starts from a random vertex d1 of the disease similarity network and in each step walks to one of the neighboring vertices for instance d2 with a known or previously predicted association with r1 with a probability proportional to the weight of the edge traversed ie the corresponding element of  in both cases the existence of a known association between a drug r1 and a disease d1 has been considered with a probability 1   then in each step of the iteration process the predicted drug-disease associations matrix is given by the mean between and  finally a bipartite drug-disease network was constructed consisting of two sets of nodes one set corresponding to all disease the other set corresponding to all approved drugs an edge between a drug and a disease occurs if an association is already known or has been predicted among them the performance of birw-based algorithm in predicting new drug-disease associations was evaluated through a tenfold cross validation 46  this is a technique to investigate the predictive power of an algorithm by partitioning the original sample into a training and test set in particular the tenfold cross-validation consists of randomly partitioning the original sample in our case the drug-disease associations into 10 equal size subsamples of the 10 subsamples a single subsample is retained as test set and the remaining 9 subsamples are used as training set the cross-validation process is then repeated for 10 iterations so that each of the 10 subsamples is used exactly once as the test set the results of each iteration were evaluated in terms of roc probability curves in particular each time the predicted drug-disease associations were ranked according to the similarity score estimated by the birwbased algorithm ie the corresponding element of matrix  and the n top-ranked drug-disease associations were selected to be evaluated by the roc curve analysis where n is the length of the test set its worth to stress that in each cross-validation trial we didnt use the information about the known drugdisease associations for the test set that were put to zero at first iteration of the bi-random walk process then the roc curve is constructed for different values of a specified threshold where a true drug-disease association was considered as correctly predicted if the estimated similarity score of this association was higher than the specified threshold the results of the roc curve analysis obtained for each iteration were averaged to obtain a mean roc curve and the corresponding area under the curve auc was calculated higher the auc better the algorithm is at distinguishing between two classes ie known drug-disease associations versus unknown drug-disease associations kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg enrichment analysis aiming to evaluate functional pathways of sars-cov-associated disease genes was performed by using r statistical software and the package clusterprofiler 82  p-values were adjusted with the false discovery rate fdr method and a threshold equal to 005 was set to identify functional annotations significantly enriched amongst the selected gene lists in order to test whether the selected anti-sars repurposable drugs can counteract the gene expression perturbations caused by the virus ie whether they down-regulate genes up-regulated by the virus or vice versa we performed a gene set enrichment analysis gsea as in 16  we first collected gene expression datasets of hosts infected sars-cov available through the geo public repository in particular transcriptome data of sars-cov-infected samples from patients peripheral blood gse1739 and calu-3 cells gse33267 to define differentially expressed genes we selected adjusted p-values less than 005 and 001 for gse1739 and gse33267 dataset respectively these differentially expressed genes were used as network-predicted

coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global health challenge consequently a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame however developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic drug repurposing by contrast provides an attractive alternative as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements in this work we demonstrate an approach to drug repurposing using a combination of probabilistic and semantically rich networks this combination together with clustering algorithms facilitates both the use of network algorithms and distributed human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs identifying drug repurposing opportunities for covid-19 we demonstrate the value of this approach reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic was discovered in wuhan china in december 2019 1  sars-cov-2 is a member of the betacoronaviruses a genus of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses the symptom profile of covid-19 infections vary with a dry cough and fever most often reported 2 and resulting in a mild illness in most cases however severe illness has been reported as occurring in as many as 20 of laboratory-confirmed infections 3  depending on population demographics and country-specific testing protocols with symptoms including acute myocardial injury 4 and acute kidney injury 5  two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses are known 6  unlike sars-cov-1 and mers-cov however sars-cov-2 is widely reported to cause asymptomatic carriage 7 in some individuals which has contributed to the rapid global spread 8  and subsequent radical world-wide restrictions on daily life to control transmission the disease now represents an unprecedented global health challenge understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis is a piecemeal process one process that is particularly well understood is the entry of sars-cov-2 into human cells which occurs via two major methods tmprss2-dependent entry and tmprss2-independent entry 9  the first method relies on two human transmembrane proteins ace2 and tmprss2 the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 which mediate coronavirus entry to human cells have been shown to have strong affinity for the human protein ace2 which is highly expressed on the surface of different cell types including lung epithelial cells and type ii alveolar cells 10  once the viral spike proteins have bound to ace2 localised tmprss2 can activate the viral spike proteins and cleave the cytoplasm-facing domain of ace2 this mechanism causes the virus membrane to fuse with the human cells membrane allowing the viral genomic rna to enter the cell where it can replicate and facilitate the production of new virions in the absence of localised tmprss2 sars-cov-2 can enter human cells expressing ace2 via another mechanism in this process the viral spike proteins bind to ace2 and the ace2 receptor protein recruits clathrin which initiates endocytosis of the virus usually following endocytosis proton pumps transport h  ions into endosomes lowering the internal ph allowing the endosome to begin the process of becoming an endolysosome and breaking down anything within however the ph-dependent enzyme cathepsin l present in endosomes are used by sars-cov-2 to activate the viral spike proteins which allow the virus to fuse with the endosomal membrane and release its genomic rna into the host cell in preparation for replication and production of more virions repurposing drugs for the treatment of covid-19 due to the rapid increase in covid-19 cases a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatment has been carried out in a short space of time given the rapid onset of the pandemic there is an urgent need to identify new drugs that are able to treat the disease and improve patient outcomes 11 12  developing novel drugs and taking them to market typically takes many years so the traditional pathways are unlikely to provide a timely treatment for the current pandemic the time pressures for new treatments make drug repurposing particularly attractive drugs approved for one indication disease may also happen to be efficacious for another if likely candidates for repurposing can be identified the time to approval for a drug can be reduced to just a few months by drawing from the pool of the many thousands of drugs that have already been through the regulatory approval process and are therefore well-characterised identifying high quality drug repurposing candidates is challenging many discoveries are serendipitous for example from observations in clinics and trials 13  however with the advent of network approaches to studying biology at a systems level new computational approaches have emerged that allow a more systematic approach to drug repurposing 14 15 16  networks are a convenient method to represent drugs genes proteins diseases etc and the relationships between them they support human investigation through visual exploration while at the same time being amenable to computational analysis enabling automated and systematic analysis drug repurposing algorithms derive new relationships between drugs targets diseases genes etc based on existing knowledge of these relationships 15  these new relationships can lead to hypotheses about novel repurposing opportunities and the evidence for them can be reviewed and then hypotheses tested in the laboratory and clinic computational drug repurposing prediction and human curation both require the availability of a variety of data sources that describe the molecular processes in a cell and their interaction with drugs these data are typically distributed in a range of different data sources and databases and may be integrated after they have been represented as networks to form an integrated network or knowledge graph 17 18 19  repurposing algorithms that operate over the data can vary from simple pattern matching or network module analysis through to the application of artificial intelligence 20 21 22 23 24  the output of these algorithms are systematic computational predictions and therefore need human curation with a range of expertise to assess their value therefore the computational prediction of repurposable drugs is usually applied in an iterative fashion coupled with the input of a human expert who is able to verify and generate hypotheses about new repurposing opportunities the need for new drugs to treat covid-19 has resulted in a large number of recent studies 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41  antiviral drugs have been the most obvious target since some of these have been shown to be active against sars for example drugs such as elbasvir are under scrutiny to this effect 42  other antiviral drugs such as remdesivir originally employed for the treatment of ebola have recently been approved for the treatment of covid-19 43  however there is still a pressing need for more candidate drugs especially those addressing the abnormal immune response seen in some patients 43 44  the wider search for repurposable drugs remains a field under active development most of these studies are computational in nature and have resulted in many potential new drug candidates these studies have employed a variety of strategies including network based analyses some of these candidates are now undergoing clinical trials to test their effectiveness 34  in this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs for drug repurposing opportunities for covid-19 we aimed to highlight potential repurposing opportunities that are possibly novel in comparison to those published so far we also introduce some newer features to our analytical process in an effort to improve accuracy by incorporating measures which take data quality into account and to speed up data verification by facilitating multiple curation many studies for example that of kumar 2020 36  have employed protein interaction networks to study the relationships between covid-19 proteins the proteins they interact with and the molecular interaction networks in the cell however data quality is an important factor in the assignment of protein interactions and has received little attention in studies to-date instead of using a standard protein interaction graph we developed a probabilistic functional interaction network for human proteins that uses highly curated interactions from biogrid as a gold standard to produce a weighted protein interaction network where the weight indicates the confidence of a functional interaction we then mapped onto this human probabilistic function integrated network pfin the interactions with covid-19 proteins discovered experimentally in gordon et al  2020 27  the process of curating computational predictions or manually analysing networks for new opportunities is a large-scale time consuming task the division of labour through network partitioning and crowdsourcing are promising approaches to more rapid verification of results 45 46  however one of the challenges facing this approach is the assignment of appropriate sections of a complex network to each curator since we were working with pfins that included weighted edges we were able to employ a clustering algorithm to partition the probabilistic network into functionally related subgraphs those subgraphs containing covid-19 protein interactors were then enriched with information from previously integrated networks to add relationships to drugs diseases genes pathways and so on each subgraph then represents a unit of the network that was systematically assigned to a curator for analysis in this fashion a large scale task is broken down and becomes faster with more curators participating in the exercise here we present details of our approach to the development and partitioning of the knowledge network and the resulting predictions for potentially repurposable drugs this work extends approaches developed by mullen et al  47  in brief a semantic knowledge graph was constructed in neo4j comprising data about existing approved drugs the data sources contributing to the knowledge graph are shown in table 1  between genes in the gold-standard and absent from the gold-standard respectively and pl andpl represent the prior expectation of linkages between genes in the gold-standard and absent from the gold-standard respectively datasets with a lls of 0 or lower were discarded and the remaining datasets were sorted in order of lls and integrated using the following formula where l 1 is the highest lls score and l n that with the lowest of a set of n datasets the denominator selected to give more weight to datasets with higher confidence was 11 as used in previous work by james et al 57  for visualisation purposes functional interaction relationships were omitted if the confidence score was lower than 4336 the pfin was clustered using a weighted mcl algorithm with the default parameters and viewed in cytoscape 58 59  next for the set of homo sapiens proteins identified as interacting with sars-cov-2 proteins by gordon et al 60  clusters from the pfin containing genes that encode at least one of these proteins were extracted decorated with edges and nodes from the knowledge base fig 1  and returned theophylline theophylline iupac name 13-dimethyl-2367-tetrahydro-1h-purine-26-dione is a methylxanthine drug with activities including smooth muscle relaxation and bronchial dilation indicated for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder copd and asthma theophylline exerts its activity through competitive inhibition of type iii and iv phosphodiesterase 61  clustering of the pfin revealed a cluster of genes one of which dnajc11  encodes the dna j homolog subfamily c member 11 protein q9nvh1 which gordon et al 27 reported as interacting with the sars-cov-2 e protein sars-cov2 e encodes the envelope protein e which plays a role in the structure and maturation of the virus 62  dnajc11 is a mitochondrial protein which is required for mitochondrial inner membrane organization which associates with the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system micos complex 62 63  the pfin suggests that dnajc11 has a high likelihood of being functionally related to ric3  which encodes the protein ric3 q7z5b4 -a protein target of theophylline fig 2 64  ric3 promotes functional expression of homomeric alpha-7 and alpha-8 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the cell surface and is found in endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus 65  the relevance of the functional relationship between dnajc11 and ric3 is unclear however the interaction was identified by affinity capture-mass spectroscopy which implies a physical binding it is possible therefore that ric3 complexes with dnajc11 although current evidence has them expressed in different organelles and theophylline could block the binding of dnajc11 by sars-cov-2 e interestingly dnajc11 has well-conserved orthologues in other species such as mouse rat and dog 66   calmodulin is a ubiquitous calcium binding protein which binds to transmembrane proteins such as ace 67  as described in the introduction ace transmembrane proteins have a distinct role in covid-19 infection 9  calmodulin plays a crucial role in regulating ace2 presence on the cell surface by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of ace2 68  a potential target for decreasing infection and viral loading could therefore be the use of calmodulin inhibitors acting to decrease the association of the two proteins without the binding of calmodulin to ace2 the cells start to shed the ectodomain of ace2 leading to decreased expression and catalytic activity 67  querying our knowledge graph for approved drugs that inhibit calm1 p0dp23 we identified 10 existing approved drugs that are labelled as inhibitors of calmodulin indicated for a range of conditions including hypertension seasonal allergies and antidepressants full list in table s1  angiotensinogen is a small peptide hormone which as part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas is involved in the regulation of blood pressure 69  via the action of renin angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin i in turn angiotensin i via the action of angiotensin converting enzyme ace is converted into angiotensin ii critically ace2 converts angiotensin ii into angiotensin 1-7 an effector of nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation which has been implicated in attenuating acute lung injury 70  the role of drugs which inhibit the raas such as commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents eg ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is controversial with arguments proposed for both harmful and protective effects 71 72 73  given that angiotensin ii is itself an approved drug it may have a therapeutic use in covid-19 via the actions of angiotensin 1-7 angiotensin ii has already been suggested as a possible therapeutic agent and is currently being investigated nct04332666 whilst inhibition of the ace2 receptor may seem an ideal target for treating covid-19 as it is required for both major mechanisms of viral entry into host cells it has been shown that ace2 is essential for repairing damage to lung tissues instead it may be possible to inhibit tmprss2 which could lead to most virus particles entering the host cell via endosomes if cathepsin l is also inhibited the endosome-enclosed viruses will be unable to escape allowing the endosomes to progress fully to endolysosomes and destroy the virus particles in this way it may be possible to not only prevent entry into the host cell and subsequent replication but also reduce overall viral load by enabling the body to destroy sars-cov-2 previous studies have suggested that an already approved drug camostat mesylate could be used as a tmprss2 inhibitor 74  in this study through rational querying of the knowledge graph drug candidates for putative cathepsin l inhibitors have been identified table 2  these candidates are all approved drugs two of these drugs telaprevir and boceprevir have been used previously to help treat chronic hepatitis c infections however both have since been discontinued due to common side effects such as severe rashes anemia decreased neutrophils and fatigue sodium aurothiomalate is a gold-containing compound approved for use treating rheumatoid arthritis this drug is not currently commonly sold due to a difficulty in sourcing sodium aurothiomalate the final potential cathepsin l inhibitor identified in this study is fostamatinib which is approved for use against chronic immune thrombocytopenia other drug repurposing studies for covid-19 have also identified this drug as a potential candidate but as an ace2 inhibitor 75  these same studies however did not evaluate it as a cathepsin l inhibitor based on this and previous studies it is therefore possible that a combined therapy of camostat mesylate and fostamatinib may aid in treating covid-19 interestingly fostamatinib was separately identified as a drug candidate via the pfin clustering approach fig 3  fostamatinib has serinethreonine-protein kinase tbk1 q9uhd2 as a drug target which was also identified by gordon et al 27 as being a protein that interacts with a sars-cov-2 protein however the relevance of this interaction if any is unclear to us  severe covid-19 disease often includes an exaggerated inflammatory response stebbing et al suggested that combining antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments is a possible means of reducing disease severity 76  in their study they examined the affinity between antiviral drugs in particular through inhibition of numb-associated kinases naks and drug targets that may be useful in attenuating inflammation eg through inhibition of janus kinases jaks as a result of the study stebbing et al identified and discussed a range of drugs including baricitinib tofacitinib and ruxolitinib to determine whether there were any additional drug candidates not discussed by stebbing et al 76  we queried our dataset for drugs targeting the naks and jaks identified in the paper these proteins were as follows aak1 q2m2i8 bike q9nsy1 gak o14976 jak1 p23458 jak2 o60674 jak3 p52333 and tyk2 p29597 in addition to baricitinib tofacitinib and ruxolitinib we also identified fostamatinib as a potential drug candidate in fact in our knowledge graph fostamatinib was the only drug recorded as having all the aforementioned proteins as drug targets epidermal growth factor receptor egfr inhibitors egfr p00533 is a protein implicated in tissue fibrosis due to its role in tgf-1 dependent fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation venkataraman and frieman 2017 77  suggested that inhibiting egfr signalling prevents excessive fibrotic responses and thus lung damage during sars infections running the query in fig 4 identified eight approved drugs that were possible egfr inhibitors --brigatinib afatinib osimertinib fostamatinib dacomitinib neratinib vandetanib and panitumumab  two covid proteins -orf9c and nsp4 -have interactions with mitochondria-related human proteins znt6 q6nxt4 encoded by the slc30a6 gene transmembrane zinc transporter located in the golgi apparatus and tim29 q9bsf4 encoded by the timm29 gene inner mitochondrial membrane translocase respectively 27  the genes encoding these proteins were both identified as having a high-confidence functional interaction with the neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-9 nachr9 protein q9ugm1 gene name chrna9 78 79  these relationships are shown in fig 5 nachr9 is a is part of the ligand-gated ionic channel and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor superfamilies and forms homo-or hetero-oligomeric divalent cation channels in the plasma membrane 80  according to drugbank nachr9 is targeted by the following small molecules lobeline galantamine nicotine tetraethylammonium rpi-78m and atg003 lobeline in its natural form from plants in the lobelia genus has been proposed and applied for therapeutic uses including respiratory disorders such as asthma as a stimulant to treat wheezing uncontrollable coughing and chest tightness 81  and has been reported to improve acute lung injury in cell lines 82  there have been promising studies carried out on mice where lobeline helped to treat acute lung injury 83  but human studies are still required nicotine induces ace2 overexpression in human bronchial epithelial cells hbepc via alpha7-nicotinic receptor 7-nachr 84  a paralog of nachr9 galantamine is a reversible competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase ache which catalyses the breakdown of ace and is an allosteric modulator of nachrs it is currently approved for mild to moderate dementia and alzheimers quercetin is a polyphenol flavonoid found in many plants 85 and has been reported as having anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties 86 87  in one of the pfin clusters quercetin was identified as targeting the human protein casein kinase ii subunit beta ck2-beta protein p67870 localised throughout the cell which gordon et al reported as being a high-confidence interactor of the sars-cov-2 n protein 27  two ck2-beta molecules together with a single alpha and alpha subunit together form the tetramer casein kinases ii ck2 ck2 acts as a serinethreonine-selective protein kinase involved in cell cycle regulation and is implicated in disorders of cell proliferation eg tumours 88  interestingly ck2 has been found to be stimulated in other viral infections 89  and has various roles in the infection cycles of different viruses 90 91  further gordon et al suggested ck2 inhibition as a possible therapeutic approach for covid-19 60  as ck2 downregulates stress granule formation 92 which is associated with enhanced viral replication in other coronavirus infections 93  thus depending on the nature of the interaction between quercetin and ck2 it may be of benefit quercetin has already been suggested as a possible therapeutic to mitigate the severity of sars-cov-2 infection as quercetin alters the expression of 30 of the human proteins that are targets of sars-cov-2 proteins 94  in summary this study aimed to build on existing studies that have used knowledge frameworks to generate hypotheses about drug repurposing opportunities for covid-19 as in other studies an integrated dataset was developed extending a drug repurposing framework developed by mullen et al 47  we aimed to enhance the knowledge network approach through the use of pfins to act as a framework to guide the hypothesis generation process the use of pfins allowed us to scale the data curation process in a systematic fashion exploiting the combined effort of multiple curators our approach could act as a template for future studies with richer knowledge graphs the incorporation of algorithmic predictions for drug repurposing and a much larger set of curators the drugs we identified for repurposing are illustrative of the value of our approach due to the rapidly developing nature of studies on sars-cov-2 and covid-19 it is difficult to identify which candidates are truly novel however even in instances where candidates have already been suggested by other studies our approach can still provide additional supporting or refuting evidence the results presented in this study are grouped by drug class where possible we have tried to avoid suggesting specific instances of drugs and focused on classes instead in part because we recognise that our database is not complete further ethically there may be socioeconomic reasons for selecting one member of a drug class over another such as supply and demand or the dependence of a subpopulation on a given drug however there are some noteworthy cases where focusing on specific drugs within a class is necessary for example fostamatinib has emerged as a drug candidate in a number of different contexts as an anti-inflammatory agent as an egfr inhibitor and as a cathepsin l inhibitor establishing it as a promising candidate one limitation of in silico drug repurposing studies is that depending on the algorithms employed many drug repurposing candidates can be suggested refinement of a large set of drug candidates often requires many person-hours of time to curate particularly when including time taken to understand the mechanisms  pathways involved by 1 leveraging a pfin-based clustering approach and 2 focusing on clusters containing high-confidence interactors with sars-cov-2 proteins we were able to reduce the drug candidate search space significantly using a crowd-sourcing approach to analyse the clusters allowed individuals to curate sets of drug candidates that were likely to be mechanistically related providing a logical partitioning of work curation allowed us to focus on drugs with additional context eg pharmacological biological evidence to support or refute the drugs discussed thus providing a balanced perspective on the drugs discussed in future studies it might be interesting to research systematic and computational approaches to integrating and ranking the findings of curators perhaps building on larger systems for data sharing and integration such as fairdomhub 95  there are a number of caveats to this research which need to be addressed to ensure results are taken in an appropriate context firstly the data sources contributing to our integrated semantic network are limited in scope and could be expanded for example the graph includes connections between drugs and their protein targets but the nature eg inhibitory stimulatory suppressor is not always recorded secondly computational prediction can only ever generate suggestions or hypotheses based on the analysis of the limited data available thus for any drug repurposing candidates suggested it is critical that these are manually curated by experts in medicine pharmacology and human biology due to recent concerns over the potential for harm in covid-19 preprints we want to stress that this research should not be used to inform clinical practice nor should people change their behaviour on the basis of it 96  supporting information s1   network-based drug repurposing for

computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repositioning 8-10 12 13  however traditional structure-based methods are limited when three-dimensional 3d structures of proteins are unavailable which unfortunately is the case for the majority of human and viral targets in addition targeting single virus proteins often have high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes 1  viruses including hcov require host cellular factors for successful replication during infections 1  systematic identification of virus-host protein-protein interactions

smaller drug-target network although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large-scale experimentally reported drug-target networks from publicly available databases the network data may be incomplete and some drug-protein interactions may be functional associations instead of physical bindings we may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further 24 69  in addition the collected virus-host interactions are far from complete and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors including different experimental assays and human cell line models we may computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for hcovs using sequence-based and structure-based approaches 70  the current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virushost interactions drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles 71  as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions including antagonists versus agonists comprehensive identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-ncov with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays 72 73  will significantly improve the accuracy of current network-based methodologies owing to lack of the complete drug target information such as the molecular promiscuity of drugs the dose-response and dose-toxicity effects for both repurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in current network models for example mesalazine an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease is  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under

mesalazine usage 74 75  preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials furthermore we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework 25  however we expect that our methodology reminds to be a useful network-based tools for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs targets with the hcov-host subnetwork in the human interactome finally we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting ncov host proteins only thus our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only thus combination of the existing anti-virus drugs such as remdesivir 76  with the networkpredicted repurposable drugs figure 5  or drug combinations figure 6  may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework in conclusion this study offers a powerful integrated network-based systems pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug combinations for the potential treatment of hcov our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-ncov outbreak from a translational perspective if broadly applied the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment

repurposing for novel coronavirus 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 yadi zhou yuan hou jiayu shen yin huang william martin feixiong cheng   coronaviruses covs typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals including humans and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections1 in the past two decades two highly pathogenic human covs hcovs including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerging from animal reservoirs have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality2 for example 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the sars-cov pandemic which cost the global economy with an estimated 30 to 100 billion34 according to the world health organization who as of november 2019 mers-cov has had a total of 2494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths the majority in saudi arabia2 in december 2019 the third pathogenic hcov named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 abbreviated as covid-195 was found in wuhan china as of 24 february 2020 there have been over 79000 cases with over 2600 deaths for the 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 outbreak worldwide furthermore human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts6 however there are currently no effective medications against 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 but effective vaccines are not available yet there is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 outbreak although investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development has increased significantly over the past two decades the annual number of new treatments approved by the us food and drug administration fda has remained relatively constant and limited7 a recent study estimated that pharmaceutical companies spent 26 billion in 2015 up from 802 million in 2003 in the development of an fda-approved new chemical entity drug8 drug repurposing represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical trials911 however experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly and time-consuming12 computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repositioning9111314 however traditional structure-based methods are limited when three-dimensional 3d structures of proteins are unavailable which unfortunately is the case for the majority of human and viral targets in addition targeting single virus proteins often has high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes1 viruses including hcov require host cellular factors for successful replication during infection1 systematic identification of virushost proteinprotein interactions ppis offers an effective way toward elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection1516 subsequently targeting cellular antiviral targets such as virushost interactome may offer a novel strategy for the development of effective treatments for viral infections1 including sars-cov17 mers-cov17 ebola virus18 and zika virus141921 we recently presented an integrated antiviral drug discovery pipeline that incorporated gene-trap insertional mutagenesis known functional druggene network and bioinformatics analyses14 this methodology allows to identify several candidate repurposable drugs for ebola virus1114 our work over the last decade has demonstrated how network strategies can for example be used to identify effective repurposable drugs132227 and drug combinations28 for multiple human diseases for example network-based drugdisease proximity sheds light on the relationship between drugs eg drug targets and disease modules molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules within the ppis and can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs as well as drug combinations as demonstrated in our recent studies13232728 in this study we present an integrative antiviral drug repurposing methodology which combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virushost interactome and drug targets in the human ppi network the basis for these experiments rests on the notions that i the proteins that functionally associate with viral infection including hcov are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human ppi network and ii proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common ppis and functional pathways elucidated by the human interactome fig 1 we follow this analysis with bioinformatics validation of drug-induced gene signatures and hcov-induced transcriptomics in human cell lines to inspect the postulated mechanism-of-action in a specific hcov for which we propose repurposing fig 1 to date seven pathogenic hcovs fig 2a b have been found129 i 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 are  genera and ii hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e are  genera we performed the phylogenetic analyses using the whole-genome sequence data from 15 hcovs to inspect the evolutionary relationship of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 with other hcovs we found that the whole genomes of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 had 9999 nucleotide sequence identity across three diagnosed patients supplementary table s1 the 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity 797 with sars-cov among the six other known pathogenic hcovs revealing conserved evolutionary relationship between 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 and sars-cov fig 2a hcovs have five major protein regions for virus structure assembly and viral replications29 including replicase complex orf1ab spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins fig 2b the orf1ab gene encodes the non-structural proteins nsp of viral rna synthesis complex through proteolytic processing30 the nsp12 is a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity from the protein 3d structure view of sars-cov nsp12 it contains a larger n-terminal extension which binds to nsp7 and nsp8 and polymerase domain fig 2c the spike is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor3132 figure 2d shows the 3d structure of the spike protein bound with the host receptor angiotensin converting enznyme2 ace2 in sars-cov pdb id 6ack a recent study showed that 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 is able to utilize ace2 as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells33 suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development furthermore cryo-em structure of the spike and biophysical assays reveal that the 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 spike binds ace2 with higher affinity than sars-cov34 in addition the nucleocapsid is also an important subunit for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization35 and the single nucleocapsid structure is shown in fig 2e protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 was most evolutionarily conserved with sars-cov supplementary table s2 specifically the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions with sequence identities of 96 and 896 respectively compared to sars-cov supplementary table s2 however the spike protein exhibited the lowest sequence conservation sequence identity of 77 between 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 and sars-cov meanwhile the spike protein of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 only has 319 sequence identity compared to mers-cov to depict the hcovhost interactome network we assembled the cov-associated host proteins from four known hcovs sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 one mouse mhv and one avian ibv n protein supplementary table s3 in total we obtained 119 host proteins associated with covs with various experimental evidence specifically these host proteins are either the direct targets of hcov proteins or are involved in crucial pathways of hcov infection the hcovhost interactome network is shown in fig 3a we identified several hub proteins including jun xpo1 npm1 and hnrnpa1 with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins kegg pathway enrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways adjusted p value  005 including measles rna transport nf-kappa b signaling epstein-barr virus infection and influenza fig 3b gene ontology go biological process enrichment analysis further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes adjusted p value  0001 including viral life cycle modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology viral process positive regulation of viral life cycle transport of virus and virion attachment to host cell fig 3c we then mapped the known drugtarget network see materials and methods into the hcovhost interactome to search for druggable cellular targets we found that 47 human proteins 39 blue nodes in fig 3a can be targeted by at least one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trials for example gsk3b dpp4 smad3 parp1 and ikbkb are the most targetable proteins the high druggability of hcovhost interactome motivates us to develop a drug repurposing strategy by specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with hcovs for potential treatment of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 the basis for the proposed network-based drug repurposing methodologies rests on the notions that the proteins that associate with and functionally govern viral infection are localized in the corresponding subnetwork fig 1a within the comprehensive human interactome network for a drug with multiple targets to be effective against an hcov its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of the corresponding subnetwork in the human proteinprotein interactome fig 1 as we demonstrated in multiple diseases13222328 using this network-based strategy we used a state-of-the-art network proximity measure to quantify the relationship between hcov-specific subnetwork fig 3a and drug targets in the human interactome we constructed a drugtarget network by assembling target information for more than 2000 fda-approved or experimental drugs see materials and methods to improve the quality and completeness of the human protein interactome network we integrated ppis with five types of experimental data 1 binary ppis from 3d protein structures 2 binary ppis from unbiased high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid assays 3 experimentally identified kinase-substrate interactions 4 signaling networks derived from experimental data and 5 literature-derived ppis with various experimental evidence see materials and methods we used a z-score z measure and permutation test to reduce the study bias in network proximity analyses including hub nodes in the human interactome network by literature-derived ppi data bias as described in our recent studies1328 in total we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated z  15 and p  005 permutation test with the hcovhost interactome fig 4a supplementary tables s4 and 5 to validate bias of the pooled cellular proteins from six covs we further calculated the network proximities of all the drugs for four covs with a large number of know host proteins including sars-cov mers-cov ibv and mhv separately we found that the z-scores showed consistency among the pooled 119 hcov-associated proteins and other four individual covs fig 4b the pearson correlation coefficients of the proximities of all the drugs for the pooled hcov are 0926 vs sars-cov p  0001 t distribution 0503 vs mers-cov p  0001 0694 vs ibv p  0001 and 0829 vs mhv p  0001 these network proximity analyses offer putative repurposable candidates for potential prevention and treatment of hcovs an overexpression of estrogen receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication37 selective estrogen receptor modulators serms have been reported to play a broader role in inhibiting viral replication through the non-classical pathways associated with estrogen receptor37 serms interfere at the post viral entry step and affect the triggering of fusion as the serms antiviral activity still can be observed in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression18 toremifene z  323 fig 5a the first generation of nonsteroidal serm exhibits potential effects in blocking various viral infections including mers-cov sars-cov and ebola virus in established cell lines1738 compared to the classical esr1-related antiviral pathway toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane glycoprotein and eventually inhibiting viral replication39 as shown in fig 5b toremifene potentially affects several key host proteins associated with hcov such as rpl19 hnrnpa1 npm1 eif3i eif3f and eif3e4041 equilin z  252 and gsea score  3 an estrogenic steroid produced by horses also has been proven to have moderate activity in inhibiting the entry of zaire ebola virus glycoprotein and human immunodeficiency virus zebov-gphiv18 altogether network-predicted serms such as toremifene and equilin offer candidate repurposable drugs for 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 angiotensin receptor blockers arbs have been reported to associate with viral infection including hcovs4244 irbesartan z  598 a typical arb was approved by the fda for treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy here network proximity analysis shows a significant association between irbesartans targets and hcov-associated host proteins in the human interactome as shown in fig 5c irbesartan targets slc10a1 encoding the sodiumbile acid cotransporter ntcp protein that has been identified as a functional pres1-specific receptor for the hepatitis b virus hbv and the hepatitis delta virus hdv irbesartan can inhibit ntcp thus inhibiting viral entry4546 slc10a1 interacts with c11orf74 a potential transcriptional repressor that interacts with nsp-10 of sars-cov47 there are several other arbs such as eletriptan frovatriptan and zolmitriptan in which their targets are potentially associated with hcov-associated host proteins in the human interactome previous studies have confirmed the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1 as the key factor in regulating various viruses replications including andes orthohantavirus and coronavirus4849 sirolimus z  235 and gsea score  3 an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin mtor was reported to effectively block viral protein expression and virion release effectively50 indeed the latest study revealed the clinical application sirolimus reduced mers-cov infection by over 6051 moreover sirolimus usage in managing patients with severe h1n1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure can improve those patients prognosis significantly50 mercaptopurine z  244 and gsea score  1 an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant property has been used to treat cancer since the 1950s and expanded its application to several auto-immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus and crohns disease52 mercaptopurine has been reported as a selective inhibitor of both sars-cov and mers-cov by targeting papain-like protease which plays key roles in viral maturation and antagonism to interferon stimulation5354 mechanistically mercaptopurine potentially target several host proteins in hcovs such as jun pabpc1 npm1 and ncl4055 fig 5d inflammatory pathways play essential roles in viral infections5657 as a biogenic amine melatonin n-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine z  172 and gsea score  2 plays a key role in various biological processes and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections5859 viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on the function of multiple organs60 the antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription6162 in addition the application of melatonin may prolong patients survival time which may provide a chance for patients immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus as shown in fig 5e melatonin indirectly targets several hcov cellular targets including ace2 bcl2l1 jun and ikbkb eplerenone z  159 an aldosterone receptor antagonist is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin by inhibiting mast-cell-derived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus63 in summary our network proximity analyses offer multiple candidate repurposable drugs that target diverse cellular pathways for potential prevention and treatment of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 however further preclinical experiments64 and clinical trials are required to verify the clinical benefits of these network-predicted candidates before clinical use sirolimus an inhibitor of mtor with both antifungal and antineoplastic properties has demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with severe h1n1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure50 the mtor signaling plays an essential role for mers-cov infection66 dactinomycin also known actinomycin d is an approved rna synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various cancer types an early study showed that dactinomycin 1 gml inhibited the growth of feline enteric cov67 as shown in fig 6b our network analysis shows that sirolimus and dactinomycin synergistically target hcov-associated host protein subnetwork by complementary exposure pattern offering potential combination regimens for treatment of hcov specifically sirolimus and dactinomycin may inhibit both mtor signaling and rna synthesis pathway including dna topoisomerase 2-alpha top2a and dna topoisomerase 2-beta top2b in hcov-infected cells fig 6b toremifene is among the approved first-generation nonsteroidal serms for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer68 serms including toremifene inhibited ebola virus infection18 by interacting with and destabilizing the ebola virus glycoprotein39 in vitro assays have demonstrated that toremifene inhibited growth of mers-cov1769 and sara-cov38 table 1 emodin an anthraquinone derivative extracted from the roots of rheum tanguticum has been reported to have various anti-virus effects specifically emdoin inhibited sars-cov-associated 3a protein70 and blocked an interaction between the sars-cov spike protein and ace2 ref 71 altogether network analyses and published experimental data suggested that combining toremifene and emdoin offered a potential therapeutic approach for 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 fig 6c as shown in fig 5a targets of both mercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with hcov-associated host proteins in the human interactome network recent in vitro and in vivo studies identified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both sars-cov and mers-cov by targeting papain-like protease5354 melatonin was reported in potential antiviral infection via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects5862 melatonin indirectly regulates ace2 expression a key entry receptor involved in viral infection of hcovs including 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 ref 33 specifically melatonin was reported to inhibit calmodulin and calmodulin interacts with ace2 by inhibiting shedding of its ectodomain a key infectious process of sars-cov7273 jun also known as c-jun is a key host protein involving in hcov infectious bronchitis virus74 as shown in fig 6d mercaptopurine and melatonin may synergistically block c-jun signaling by targeting multiple cellular targets in summary combination of mercaptopurine and melatonin may offer a potential combination therapy for 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 by synergistically targeting papain-like protease ace2 c-jun signaling and anti-inflammatory pathways fig 6d however further experimental observations on ace2 pathways by melatonin in 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 are highly warranted in this study we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification of putative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 integration of drugtarget networks hcovhost interactions hcov-induced transcriptome in human cell lines and human proteinprotein interactome network are essential for such identification based on comprehensive evaluation we prioritized 16 candidate repurposable drugs fig 5 and 3 potential drug combinations fig 6 for targeting 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 however although the majority of predictions have been validated by various literature data table 1 all network-predicted repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in various 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 experimental assays64 and randomized clinical trials before being used in patients we acknowledge several limitations in the current study although 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 shared high nucleotide sequence identity with other hcovs fig 2 our predictions are not 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 specific by lack of the known host proteins on 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 we used a low binding affinity value of 10 m as a threshold to define a physical drugtarget interaction however a stronger binding affinity threshold eg 1 m may be a more suitable cut-off in drug discovery although it will generate a smaller drugtarget network although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large scale experimentally reported drugtarget networks from publicly available databases the network data may be incomplete and some drugtarget interactions may be functional associations instead of physical bindings for example silvestrol a natural product from the flavagline was found to have antiviral activity against ebola75 and coronaviruses76 after adding its target an rna helicase enzyme eif4a76 silvestrol was predicted to be significantly associated with hcovs z  124 p  0041 by network proximity analysis to increase coverage of drugtarget networks we may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further2526 in addition the collected virushost interactions are far from completeness and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors including different experimental assays and human cell line models we may computationally predict a new virushost interactome for 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 using sequence-based and structure-based approaches77 drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles78 as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions including antagonists vs agonists the current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virushost interactions comprehensive identification of the virushost interactome for 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays7980 will significantly improve the accuracy of the proposed network-based methodologies further owing to a lack of the complete drug-target information such as the molecular promiscuity of drugs the doseresponse and dosetoxicity effects for both repurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in the current network models for example mesalazine an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease is a top network-predicted repurposable drug associated with hcovs fig 5a yet several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities including pneumonia associated with mesalazine usage8182 integration of lung-specific gene expression23 of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 host proteins and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling83 may reduce side effects of repurposable drugs or drug combinations preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials furthermore we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework28 however we expect that our methodology remain to be a useful network-based tool for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs targets with the hcovhost subnetwork in the human interactome finally we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting ncov host proteins only thus our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only thus combination of the existing anti-virus drugs such as remdesivir64 with the network-predicted repurposable drugs fig 5 or drug combinations fig 6 may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework16 in conclusion this study offers a powerful integrative network-based systems pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug combinations for the potential treatment of 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 outbreak from a translational perspective if broadly applied the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other emerging viral infections and other human complex diseases as well in total we collected dna sequences and protein sequences for 15 hcovs including three most recent 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 genomes from the ncbi genbank database 28 january 2020 supplementary table s1 whole-genome alignment and protein sequence identity calculation were performed by multiple sequence alignment in embl-ebi database httpswwwebiacuk with default parameters the neighbor joining nj tree was computed from the pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix using mega x84 with 1000 bootstrap replicates the protein alignment and phylogenetic tree of hcovs were constructed by mega x84 we collected hcovhost protein interactions from various literatures based on our sizeable efforts the hcov-associated host proteins of several hcovs including sars-cov mers-cov ibv mhv hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 were pooled these proteins were either the direct targets of hcov proteins or were involved in critical pathways of hcov infection identified by multiple experimental sources including high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid y2h systems viral protein pull-down assay in vitro co-immunoprecipitation and rna knock down experiment in total the virushost interaction network included 6 hcovs with 119 host proteins supplementary table s3 next we performed kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and gene ontology go enrichment analyses to evaluate the biological relevance and functional pathways of the hcov-associated proteins all functional analyses were performed using enrichr85 here we collected drugtarget interaction information from the drugbank database v4386 therapeutic target database ttd87 pharmgkb database chembl v2088 bindingdb89 and iupharbps guide to pharmacology90 the chemical structure of each drug with smiles format was extracted from drugbank86 here drugtarget interactions meeting the following three criteria were used i binding affinities including ki kd ic50 or ec50 each 10 m ii the target was marked as reviewed in the uniprot database91 and iii the human target was represented by a unique uniprot accession number the details for building the experimentally validated drugtarget network are provided in our recent studies132328 to build a comprehensive list of human ppis we assembled data from a total of 18 bioinformatics and systems biology databases with five types of experimental evidence i binary ppis tested by high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid y2h systems ii binary physical ppis from protein 3d structures iii kinase-substrate interactions by literature-derived low-throughput or high-throughput experiments iv signaling network by literature-derived low-throughput experiments and v literature-curated ppis identified by affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry ap-ms y2h or by literature-derived low-throughput experiments all inferred data including evolutionary analysis gene expression data and metabolic associations were excluded the genes were mapped to their entrez id based on the ncbi database92 as well as their official gene symbols based on genecards httpswwwgenecardsorg in total the resulting human proteinprotein interactome used in this study includes 351444 unique ppis edges or links connecting 17706 proteins nodes representing a 50 increase in the number of the ppis we have used previously detailed descriptions for building the human proteinprotein interactome are provided in our previous studies13232893 we posit that the human ppis provide an unbiased rational roadmap for repurposing drugs for potential treatment of hcovs in which they were not originally approved given c the set of host genes associated with a specific hcov and t the set of drug targets we computed the network proximity of c with the target set t of each drug using the closest method1documentclass12ptminimal

simulation based drug-repurposing yogesh kumar harvijay singh chirag patel n   the highly contagious and pathogenic novel severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 causative agent ongoing covid-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and posed a health threat of unprecedented magnitude on the global population the novel sars-cov-2 was first reported in december 2019 to have emerged in the live wildlife market in the wuhan region of hubei province where it has caused mystic pneumonia-like respiratory illnesses in the human population of the affected area 1 according to data presented by the covid-19 situation report from world health organization who as of may 15 2020 the virus has infected more than 4347935 people around the world including a staggering 297241 deaths with a cumulative mortality rate of 68 and exponentially increased in between march and april 2 despite the instantaneous and monumental research efforts from the scientific community around the globe at present no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine is available for covid-19 however significant efforts have been made to the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs which were under small scale clinical trials 34 presently the sars-cov-2 infected patients treatments have been limited to the use of prophylactic and symptomatic management like mild symptoms such as dry cough sore throat and fever and various fatal complications including organ failure septic shock pulmonary edema severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 5 therefore there is an urgent need for the discovery of a potential treatment therapy to check and control the sars-cov-2 pandemic coronaviruses covs belong to family coronaviridae of viruses constitute an important class of pathogens for humans and other vertebrates 6 before the current sars-cov-2 only six of the covs were known to cause mild to severe illnesses in humans the novel human coronavirus hcov229e and hcovnl63 fall in genera alpha-coronavirus cause milder upper respiratory disease in adults and sometimes can also cause severe infection in infants and young children whereas the beta-coronaviruses like hcovoc43 hku1 sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus which has triggered an epidemic in china during 200203 and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus an etiological agent of middle east coronavirus epidemic of 2012 have potential to cause infection in lower respiratory tract along with cough  fever and triggers severe respiratory illness in humans 7 the causative agent of the current outbreak sars-cov-2 also belongs to beta coronaviruses 8 and is closely related to sars-cov with an overall genomic sequence similarity of 79 all of these covs belong to the coronaviridae a family of viruses that possess a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome 9 the virion of sars-cov-2 is consists of crown-shaped peplomers 80160 nm in diameter and consists of a 30 kb long single-stranded rna molecule of positive polarity with 5 cap and 3 poly-a tail 10 the rna genome is composed of at least six open reading frames orfs of which the first orf orf1ab makes up the 5two-third and encodes two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab both of which furthermore leads to the production of 16 nonstructural proteins nsps other orfs that make up the remaining one-third of the viral genome give rise to the production of four main structural factors of the virion spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n 11 the sars-cov-2 virus uses the heterotrimeric spike s protein which consists of s1 and s2 subunit on its surface to interacts with the ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular receptor abundantly expressed on many cell types in human tissues 12 upon internalization into the cell genomic rna is used as a template for direct translation of two polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab which encodes several crucial nonstructural proteins nsps including two proteases chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro or main protease mpro -nsp5 and papain-like a protease ppro -nsp3 both of which processes the polypeptide pp1a and pp1ab in a sequence-specific manner to produce 16 different nsps 1314 the papain protease processes the polyprotein to generate nsp14 at the same time the mpro operates at as many as 11 cleavage sites by specifically recognizing the sequence leu-glnser-ala-gly  marks the cleavage site to generate rest of the critical nsps including helicase methyltransferase and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp all of which play a critical role in the viral infection cycle by forming a replication-transcription complex rtc 15 therefore the main protease constitutes a major and attractive drug target to block the production of nonstructural viral components and thereby to hamper the replication event of the virus life cycle additionally no human protease with similar cleavage specificity is known to rule out the possibility of cellular toxicity upon the potential inhibition of the main viral protease 16 in recent years drug repurposing methodology has emerged as a resourceful alternative to fasten the drug development process against rapidly spreading emerging infections such as the one of sars-cov-2 17 the approach of drug repurposing has successfully led to the discoveries of potential drug candidates against several diseases such as ebola disease hepatitis c virus and zika virus infection 1819 recently several repurposing studies on sars-cov-2 have been performed using clinically approved drugs 20 among which a very new study comes out on a clinical trial of lopinavirritonavir drug for covid-19 which was indicated on top of our drug repurposing study 21 in the present study we have performed in silico based drug repurposing method using molecular docking studies on the spectrum of food and drug administration fda - approved antiviral drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro to this end a recently elucidated x-ray crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro pdb id 6y2f which have been shown with an -ketoamide as a potent inhibitor in the enzymes active site was chosen and screened for several fda approved antiviral drugs to simulate the mpro- -ketoamide interactions and thereby blocking the active pocket 16 the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro in the apo form pdb id 6y2e and -ketoamide bound form pdb id 6y2f shows that the protein makes a crystallographic dimer composed of two monomers of identical conformations each protomer furthermore is made up of three domains the interface of domain i and domain ii form the active site of the protein which is composed of a cys145-his41 dyad where -ketoamide derivative 13b is bound fig 1
a the uniquely globular domain iii is linked to domain ii through a linker region and deemed essential for the catalytic activity of these chymotrypsin-like proteas 22 the -ketoamide derivative 13b is shown bound in the active site it is stabilized by several interactions with the active site residues his41  cys145 and adjacent residues in substrate binding cleft such as gly143 and ser144 16 fig 1b we have selected several existing fda approved drugs most of which are reported to be used in humans for countering certain viral infections and screened them for binding in the active cleft of mpro our results have shown that some of the drugs occupied the active site of mpro with even increased binding affinity than that of the bound -ketoamide 13b while the rest of the compounds has shown appreciable binding while holding most of the crucial active site determinants we envisage that further in vitro examination of the inhibitory potential of these drugs on the catalytic activity of the main protease could lead the way to repurpose one or more of the tested fda approved drugs in this study as a treatment therapy for sars-cov-2 induced disease to understand the evolutionary relationship between the previously known human coronavirus and the novel sars-cov-2 we have performed the phylogenetic analysis for analysis all the closely related and complete reference genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were downloaded from the ncbi genbank database a total of 50 genomes were considered for the study mega 60 was used for multiple sequence alignment and construction of a phylogenetic tree and 1000 bootstrap replicates performed using the neighbor-joining method 23 the recently elucidated x-ray crystal structure coordinates of sar-cov-2 mpro was downloaded from rcsb pdb pdb id 6y2f having 175  resolution in this structure the mpro was co-crystallized with the improved bound -ketoamide 13b inhibitor and multiple intermolecular interactions of the ligand with the active site residues are characterized 16 to further identify the potent inhibitors for sar-cov-2 mpro among the fda approved antiviral drugs we have downloaded more than 75 drug compounds from the pubchem chemical database 24 for molecular docking based drug repurposing the download 3d structures of compounds and protein were prepared the docking study was performed by autodock vina 25 which uses a lamarckian genetic algorithm ga in combination with grid-based energy estimation to check the docking accuracy of software we have performed re-docking to the co-crystal bound ligand the main aim of this molecular interaction study was to identify the highly interacting drug with sar-cov-2 protein crystal structure and to propose the drug by in-silico repurposing method all the interaction visualization analysis studies were performed by discoverystudio visualizer ds pymol molecular visualization tool and ligplot 2627 the molecular dynamics md simulations were performed by yasara

physical movement of atoms and molecules which provides the structural level integrity and conformational changes that occur in the protein-ligand docked complex in the present study the docked complexes of virtually screened top three drugs lopinavir-ritonavir tipranavir and raltegravir with the x-ray crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpropdb id 6y2f were analyzed through md simulations the

mean square fluctuation rmsf evaluations 30 the sequence alignment of the sar-cov-2 genome shows high similarity with the closely related reference genomes of other coronaviruses the blastn search of

total 12 complete genomes of sars-cov-2 and bat-sl-cov in which ten genomes are of sars-cov-2 which were isolated from patients in different countries china mn9886681 nc0455122 mn9383841 mn9752621 usa mn9944671 mn9944681 mn9853251 mn9974091 mn9887131 and nepal mt0726881 the other two genomes of bat-sl-cov were isolated from china mg7729331 mg7729341 in clade iii there are two complete genomes of bat coronavirus isolated from germany gu1902151 and kenyan bat ky3524071 the rest of the 11 complete genomes of viruses are from hibicovirus nobecovirus merbecovirus and embecovirus importantly phylogenetic analysis revealed that there is no divergence in the sar-cov-2 genome sequence of different sar-cov-2 viruses isolated from different countries during the ongoing outbreak fig 2
 coronaviruses use a chymotrypsin-like a protease along with papain protease to process and cleaves its long polyprotein precursor into individually functional nsps multiple sequence analysis of the main protease of sars-cov-2 with that of sars-cov reveals that amino acid sequence is conserved with a sequence identity of 96 fig 3
 the active site residues are thoroughly conserved and make a catalytic cys145-his41 dyad additionally there are substrate-binding subsites positioned in the active site groove of the protease the specific subsite residues located in the enzyme active site are named as s1 s1 s2 s3 and s4 depending on their relative position to the cleavage site and subsites p1 p1 p2 p3 and p4 in the polyprotein subsite p1 corresponds to the amino acid just before the cleavage site and position p1 corresponds to the residue immediately after the cleavage site 3132 in the mpro of sars-cov-2 active site region the s1 residues are contributed by cys145 gly143 and ser144 which also serve as the oxyanion hole the s1 residue is his163 while glu166  gln189 located at the s2 position bulky gln189 and pro168 make the s4 site 16 fig 4
a the main protease recognizes and binds specific residues at each subsite of the peptide substrate to determine the initiation of proteolysis and production of nsps for the formation of the replication-transcription complex the molecular docking based virtual screening of fda approved antiviral drugs against the sars-cov-2 mpro revealed the strong interaction with higher docking energy and binding affinities all the potential drugs docked with the independent confirmation in the active site of protein where the co-crystal structure ligand improved -ketoamide 13b bound molecular docking binding affinity of all the docked and analyzed drugs with their binding energy ranking is shown in table s1 the molecular re-docking was also performed to check the docking accuracy of the software autodock vina and it was observed that the co-crystal bound ligand and re-docked ligand shows rmsd value of 051  suggesting the high fidelity of docking method fig 4b in the present study we focused on the top 10 docking results for further analysis as these drug compounds showing higher binding affinity as lopinavir-ritonavir -106 kcalmol tipranavir -87 kcalmol raltegravir -83 kcalmol -ketoamide13b -83 kcalmol nelfinavir -82 kcalmol dolutegravir -81 kcalmol tenofovir-disoproxil -81 kcalmol baloxavir-marboxil -81 kcalmol letermovir -80 kcalmol and maraviroc -80 kcalmol although among the top 10 drugs the top three drug compounds were showing binding affinity even higher than that of the improved -ketoamide 13b compound fig 5

b interestingly the binding energy score of lopinavir-ritonavir in protein-ligand docking was found to be even better than that of the docked -ketoamide and the in silico inhibition constant ki was obtained to be 16 nm in silico inhibition constant ki as obtained by docking is given in table 2
 for the top 10 drugs drug tipranavir or tipranavir disodium is another nonpeptidic protease inhibitor used in combination with ritonavir to treat hiv infection 49 in our study the drug shows interaction with gln192 met165 both form hydrogen bonding gln189 asp187 met49 arg188 ser46 cys44 thr25 and his41 in different conformation from that of -ketoamide inhibitor figs 5b and 9d we hypothesize that tipranavir or its other derivatives with even improved binding affinity in combination with ritonavir could serve as the potential protease inhibitor to counter sras-cov-2 multiplication in cell-based assay another drug that has shown comparable binding affinity and binding energy with that of the docked -ketoamide in mpro active site the raltegraviris a characterized antiretroviral medication which works by inhibiting the integrase strand transfer and is used in combination with other drugs to relieve the hiv infection 42 in the present study the raltegravir drug shows interaction with his164 arg188 gln192 glu166 all residues were bonded with strong hydrogen bond met49 met165 phe140 pro168 and leu167 the drug shows four h-bonds with nearest interacting amino acids of the sars-cov-2 mpro enzyme which indicates good inhibition figs 5c and 9c this drug could also be used with other combinations like raltegravir and lopinavir for the treatment of covid-19 if found producing desirable inhibitory effect against sars-cov-2 protease in biochemical activity assay or cell-based assays additionally other drugs that were screened and docked in the substrate-binding cleft of the mpro has shown good binding energy score which is comparably similar to the original compound in the protein crystal structure many of these drugs such as dolutegravir letermovir  nelfinavir are commonly used for treating different infections ranging from hiv to cytomegalovirus by employing the different mechanisms of action 50 51 52 the identified repurposed drug and their interaction with binding amino acids in the mpro active site have been shown in table 1 after screening the different fda approved drugs the present study enabled us to understand the mode of interaction of approved antiretroviral drugs with new coronavirus sars-cov-2 main protease enzyme the top three drugs lopinavir-ritonavir raltegravir and tipranavir were further run for md simulations studies for the period of 10 ns in the results we see that all three ligands are intact and bound to its binding site later the protein backbone rmsd analysis of all the complexes was performed which reveals that nearly all three complexes were stable after 4 ns and showing rmsd calculations within the range of 152458  after starting from 05  fig 6 the total binding energies were showing that drug lopinavir-ritonavir was showing more stable energy values fig 7 in order to know the effect of ligands binding on the sars-cov-2 mpro we performed the rmsf analysis from the average rmsf of protein constituting residues atoms since all trajectories of all complexes become stable with minor fluctuations between range 102  fig 8 from the analysis it was observed that lopinavir-ritonavir shows all hydrogen bonds made with nine acceptors and two donors whereas a total number of 20 hydrogen bonds are possible fig s1 in raltegravir 11 acceptors and three donors h-bonds were formed whereas a total number of 25 hydrogen bonds are possible similarly drug tipranavir formed eight acceptors and two donors h-bonds in contrast a total number of 18 hydrogen bonds are possible fig s1 this md simulation analysis shows the promising binding stability of the drug compounds with the binding pocket of cov-2 mpro pdb id 6y2f however we believe that all the drugs studied and screened for repurposing against covid-19 in this study should furthermore be tested and their in vitro inhibitory potential needs to be investigated through robust biochemical proteolytic activity assays and other biophysical  structural studies in conclusion this study reveals the potential of repurposed antiviral drugs to bind in the active site of sars-cov-2 main protease in a highly specific binding pattern similar to that of the crystal bound -ketoamide mpro structure three of the screened drugs lopinavir-ritonavir raltegravir and tipranavir have shown the strongest binding and that md simulation study confirmed the stability and conformational flexibility of these drugs in the enzyme active site since all the drugs identified in this study are of known pharmacokinetics standards and approved by fda for human use for the treatment of respective illneses so it may be possible to move straight to clinical trials as per standard and approved by fda for new indication and therefore can fasten up the process of the therapeutics development against sars-cov-2 infection the molecular dynamics studies performed in this study for screened top three drugs also proving the binding conformational stability with cov-2 mpro our phylogenetic analysis of the available genomes of sars-cov-2 isolated from different sources also reveals that the virus is not showing any sign of severing mutation or diversification rapidly therefore the repurposed drug combinations could be used against sars-cov-2 on the pan-community level furthermore we suggest that the efficacy of the repurposed drugs in this study needs to be experimentally confirmed by carrying out the biochemical and structural studies for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 no funding sources none declared not required  drug repurposing in the era of covid19 a call for leadership and government investment jennifer martin h nikola bowden a   drug repurposing involves identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original intended or approved medical use6 7 it represents an appropriate alternative strategy in the current era reducing development time and costs compared with de novo drug discovery and development it is a relatively new term for a process that has been happening for many years in simple terms it involves identifying existing compounds through biological plausibility in vitro in vivo and in silico studies or serendipitous clinical observation provision of these compounds to patients can be through compassionate use or clinical trials which in the setting of the current pandemic raises many ethical questions these include for example opportunity cost where a patient is given a drug with little efficacy that precludes them from taking a more effective one and selection for a hospitalbased clinical trial which then reduces the ability of patients to partake in better trials in the future it needs to be clear however that a drug repurposing strategy requires time funding and drug development knowledge to understand how to use the drugs appropriately and prevent toxicity the required clinical pharmacology and clinical trial knowledge to support use albeit based on smaller and shorter studies compared with the full dossier needed for a new chemical entity must still be undertaken before appropriate drug prescribing or registration can occur sometimes however only bioequivalence studies are required registration for clinical use of a new strength formulation and indication of morphine sulfate pentahydrate required a single randomised controlled trial and a literature review only8
 although the methodology has been around for some time the profile of drug repurposing has recently risen for three main reasons firstly using existing drugs for new purposes reduces drug development time by utilising what is already known about those drugs including their pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics common and uncommon toxicities dosing schedule and mechanism of action this means secondly that most steps of the preclinical and early clinical development phases can be bypassed1 as such drug repurposing presents a significantly faster pathway into phase 2 trials compared with traditional drug discovery and development where the safety dosing and toxicity profile of new drugs is not known thirdly as a result developmentrelated financial investment is substantially reduced7
 while the discovery and development of new drugs remains essential a new drug requires 1216 years processing time and an investment of us12 billion to achieve regulatory approval in contrast repurposing an existing drug for a new therapeutic use takes on average 65 years to obtain approval and an investment of us300 million9 a combination of both traditional drug development and drug repurposing is therefore prudent if we are to make timely inroads into treating human coronaviruses more efficiently and deliver a significant impact on human health drug repurposing has been used successfully in many clinical settings extensively reviewed by pushpakom and colleagues7 a famous example was the incidental discovery that sildenafil viagra pfizer originally used to relieve the symptoms of angina was also effective for erectile dysfunction receiving united states food and drug administration approval in 19989 within the first 3 years of approval nearly 8 million men were taking sildenafil in the us alone with annual sales of us15 billion10 similarly thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 as a sedative but withdrawn in 1961 after it caused skeletal defects in more than 15 000 children thirty years later the antiangiogenic actions of thalidomide were discovered making it an attractive drug to repurpose for cancer treatment within 4 years thalidomide was approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma11 the thalidomide story shows that no drug is ever understood completely and repositioning no matter how unlikely often remains a possibility6
 time is important as we are in the middle of a pandemic however research and development funding is often not available from the pharmaceutical industry significant government investment is therefore needed for 
pharmacology scientistsdrug repurposing groups around australia to work with the national drug discovery centre led from the walter and eliza hall institute and clinicians immunology microbiology infectious diseases and clinical pharmacology to enable drug options and provide knowledge about clinical trial design andexperts in translational drug development including clinical pharmacologists pharmacists and clinician trialists in infectious diseases
 although the media commonly appear willing to portray a development in the laboratory as a miracle drug it is a long way from rediscovering drugs in the laboratory to understanding their mechanism of action doseresponse relationship inhibitory and effective concentrations and efficacy and safety in humans how these chemicals affect pathophysiology and people with the disease and what doses to use and their timing it is very important that new lab discoveries or revisited older work in cell lines and underpowered poorly designed clinical trials even if biologically plausible are not assumed to mean a drug at a certain dose or regimen can be used in patients as a recent example in the covid19 era president donald trump announced that the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine will be available to patients in the united states as it has shown very very encouraging early results in treating covid1912 the announcement was followed by a number of letters of concern from clinicians and scientists13 14 and the us food and drug administration has clarified that use of the drug in this context still requires a clinical trial before registration15 the appropriate method of developing a repurposed drug while it is of interest to have a us president tweeting about use of a theoretical proposition to a world pandemic hope must be tempered with clinical and scientific reality and funding to deliver the translational knowledge specifically we must be cognisant of the fact that use of these drugs may cause toxicity  in this case fatal arrhythmias at the doses likely to be needed for antiviral efficacy or toxicity without efficacy at all worse still use of these drugs may reduce opportunities for a patient to receive another more useful therapy or stifle investment in potentially more beneficial options as a second similar example two antivirals used in treating human immunodeficiency virus infection lopinavir and ritonavir were also touted as being a potential treatment for covid19 a clinical trial has now reported this combination to be ineffective and also cause toxicity16 recent media coverage has reported similar toxicity17 remdesivir a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral rna polymerases has shown in vitro activity against sarscov2 with supportive data from a recent pharmaceutical company funded peer reviewed study of 61 severe covid19positive patients18 clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients 68 further trials are currently underway a major issue highlighted by this study18 and one we wish to highlight as the drug repurposing field moves forward is that the study design including appropriate drug dosage and regimen for the new indication must be based on sound biology immunology pharmacology and clinical pharmacology the deliberations in the study around choice of dose are not provided it thus remains unclear whether the lopinavirritonavir study16 was negative because the drugs do not work or the pharmacology knowledge was inadequate that is the optimal dose and comedications were incorrect in their discussion the authors state that the 50 effective concentrations ec50 suggest that there was inadequate dosing for this virus for example the ec50 of lopinavir in vitro for sarscov ranged from 40 to 107 gml although other studies reported that lopinavir was inactive or that higher concentrations 25 gml were required for inhibition the authors also question whether the ec50 value is an adequate threshold and whether unbound lopinavir concentrations in human plasma at the doses used were sufficient for inhibition of sarscov2 importantly lopinavir exposure in this study was not measured critically unwell patients have different doseexposure relationships to chronically unwell patients owing to the role of third spacing and also effects of inflammation on drug clearance it is therefore unclear whether the study was negative because the drugs do not work or rather the pharmacology knowledge was inadequate so how do we move the field forward rapidly firstly we need an integrative antiviral drug repurposing methodology in the us a systems pharmacologybased network medicine platform has been developed19 quantifying the interplay between the human coronavirushost interactome and drug targets in the human proteinprotein interaction network potential antihuman coronavirus repurposable drugs eg melatonin mercaptopurine sirolimus were further validated by enrichment analyses of druggene signatures and human coronavirusinduced transcriptomics data in human cell lines three potential drug combinations were then identified eg sirolimusdactinomycin mercaptopurinemelatonin and toremifeneemodin19 this is a helpful shortcut to enable the clinical pharmacology platform to be developed for future clinical trials there has also been considerable discussion about angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 inhibitors being detrimental in covid19 treatment4 ace2 a monocarboxypeptidase is a homologue of ace negatively regulating the reninangiotensin system by converting angiotensin ang ii to ang17 thereby reducing ang ii the primary effector of the reninangiotensin system decreasing vasoconstriction and increasing production of the vasodilatory ang17 ace2 is membrane bound but the role of membrane bound versus soluble ace2 is unclear human pathogenic coronaviruses bind to their target cells through ace2 expressed by epithelial cells of the lung intestine kidney and blood vessels as ace2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes  who along with patients with hypertension are often treated with ace inhibitors and ang ii type 1 at1 receptor blockers  upregulation of ace2 is common in some patient groups ace2 levels can also be increased by ibuprofen it was therefore hypothesised that increased expression of ace2 as occurs with treatment of many people with diabetes and hypertension would facilitate infection with covid1920 for readers interested in this field activators of ace2 such as diminazene and xnt 12dimethylaminoethylamino4hydroxymethyl74methylphenylsulfonyloxy9hxanthene9one reduce mrna levels of renin ace angiotensinogen at1 receptor receptors and proinflammatory cytokines and increase levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin10 what occurs in humans with such chemicals in terms of toxicity efficacy and dosage is not known21 in distinction using a thorough knowledge of the biology pharmacology and physiological of the reninangiotensin system the outcomes of a us multicentre doubleblind study of patients with covid19 requiring inpatient hospital admission randomised 11 to a pharmacologically plausible dose of losartan an angiotensin receptor blocker or placebo for 7 days httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04312009 will be of significant interest as these drugs are available now it appears that now is the time to focus on health care driven drug repurposing initiatives with input from the pharmaceutical industry together with experienced scientists clinicians and medicines regulators this will enable us to more rapidly assess and test potentially efficacious drugs that will ease the burden of pandemics such as covid19 no relevant disclosures not commissioned externally peer reviewed  a drug repurposing screen identifies hepatitis c antivirals as inhibitors of the sars-cov-2 main 1 protease 2 3 jeremy baker d rikki uhrich l gerald kraemer c jason love e brian kraemer c  the sars coronavirus type 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible 18 between humans that has caused the covid-19 pandemic 12  this pandemic has the potential to disrupt 19 healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality especially amongst the elderly the 20 overall case fatality rate for covid-19 is estimated to be 23 overall 3 and 323 in hospitalized patients 21 age 70-79 years 4  therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in covid-19 are presently 22  limited by a lack of effective sars-cov-2 antiviral drugs although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment 23 can be helpful a variety of potential antiviral targets for sars-cov-2 have been considered including 24 the spike protein and replicase based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for hiv-1 and 25 hepatitis c the sars-cov-2 main protease mpro appears an attractive target for drug development 26 here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing 27 as selective and potent inhibitors of sars-cov-2 mpro we screened a collection of 6070 drugs with a 28 previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of mpro in vitro in our primary 29 screen we found 50 compounds with activity against mpro overall hit rate 075 subsequent dose 30 validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an ic50  50 m hits from our screen are 31 enriched with hepatitis c ns34a protease targeting drugs including boceprevir ic50095 m 32 ciluprevir 2077m narlaprevir ic50110m and telaprevir 1525m these results demonstrate 33 that some existing approved drugs can inhibit sars-cov-2 mpro and that screen saturation of all approved 34 drugs is both feasible and warranted taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial 35 drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis c ns34a viral protease should be revisited because some 36 previous lead compounds may be more potent against sars-cov-2 mpro than boceprevir and suitable for 37 rapid repurposing 38 the sars virus and sars-cov-2 the cause of the covid-19 pandemic are zoonotic coronaviruses 44 found in bats that can infect humans initial symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection include fever myalgia 45 cough and headache infection usually resolves without active medical intervention but for a subset of 46 cases infection can progress to viral pneumonia and a variety of complications including acute lung 47 targetable activities for covid-19 the coronavirus mpro seems a likely choice for rapid drug 66 to accelerate drug development we employed a drug repurposing strategy an approach of utilizing 68 previously approved drugs for new indications 1213  previous work suggests libraries enriched with known 69 bioactive drug-like compounds provide the best opportunity for finding new lead compounds 1415  thus 70 we attempted the selective optimization of side activities sosa approach 16 as a rapid and cost effective 71 means to identify candidate hits while minimizing the number of compounds screened the sosa 72 approach proceeds by two steps first a limited set of carefully chosen structurally diverse well-73 characterized drug molecules are screened as approved drugs their bioavailability toxicity and efficacy 74 in human therapy has already been demonstrated 16 17  to screen as much of the available approved drug 75 space as possible in an easily accessible format we chose to screen the broad institute drug repurposing 76 library 6070 compounds see table s1  18  this represents about half of the approximately 14000 77 approved or experimental drugs known to human clinical medicine 19  there are significant cost and time 78 advantages realized by drug repurposing as it can accelerate the preclinical phase of development and 79 streamline clinical trials to focus on efficacy rather than safety 80 repositioning existing approved drugs with the capacity to inhibit covid-19 virus replication and 81 infection would be of profound utility and immediately impact health care in the current pandemic there 82 are no drugs in clinical use specifically targeting coronavirus replication the major advantage of the 83 approach taken here is that by screening drugs with a history of previous clinical use we will be focusing 84 on compounds with known properties in terms of pharmacokinetics pk pharmacodynamics pd and 85 toxicity thus the broad repurposing library we screened consists of compounds suitable for rapid 86 translation to human efficacy trials 87 we began assay development by selecting potentially suitable synthetic mpro substrates and compared 90 catalyzed hydrolysis curves between 5 fluorescently labeled substrates ac-abu-tle-leu-gln-afc 20  91 dabcyl-vklq-edans ac-vklq-afc dabcyl-tsavlqsgfrkm-edans 21  and mca-92 22  we chose to use the recently published ac-abu-tle-leu-gln-afc 93 abu2-aminobutyrate tletbutylglycine synthetic non-canonical amino-acid containing peptide as 94 mpro more readily cleaves this preferred sequence as compared to the native vklq sequence 20 fig 1a  95 substrates dabcyl-tsavlqsgfrkm-edans and mca-avlqsgfr-kdnp-k-nh2 had 96 drastically lower rates of mpro catalyzed hydrolysis and were not considered further in our assay 97 development  fig 1a  to determine concentration ratios between mpro and substrate we next preformed 98 a two-dimensional titration and chose 625nm mpro and 8m substrate for a balance of relatively modest 99 mpro protein requirement and a robust fluorescence intensity  fig 2b  before screening the broad library 100 we piloted our assay

therapeutic drugs to treat a new disease indication 125 this approach is particularly relevant for covid-19 because of the potential for an accelerated clinical 126 impact as compared to de novo drug development a systematic approach to facilitate drug repurposing 127 has recently been described  18  http wwwbroadinstituteorgrepurposing and has made a large collection 128 of drugs with previous history of use in humans available for high throughput screening we acquired this at 384-well density using the optimized kinetic mpro assay described in fig 1 our overall repurposing 131 strategy is described in fig 2a we conducted a single point screen at 50 m compound concentration and 132 observed 50 compounds with activity against sars-cov-2 mpro for an overall hit rate 075 these 133 compounds were screened in parallel against the natural amino acid substrate ac-vklq-afc as well as 134 a kinetically preferred substrate ac-abu-tle-leu-gln-afc  fig 2b  individual compounds are shown 135 in table 1  virtually any hit from the broad library z-score  -2 was validated for dose-responsiveness all suitable 140 compounds passing this filter with satisfactory curve fitting and potency were ordered as powder and re-141 validated future efforts will test for selectivity and in orthogonal assays for suitability although outside 142 the scope of this report determination of viral anti-replicative properties as well as toxic profile at required 143 dosage will be determined the goal of this paradigm is to find suitable candidates for development both 144 as tools for probing underlying mechanisms of sars-cov-2 as well as for translational potential b 145 screen of the broad repurposing library library was screened at a concentration of 50m against both 146 ac-vklq-afc black and ac-abu-tle-leu-gln-afc purple hit window was considered for 147 compounds falling below z-score  -2 against both substrates and consisted of 50 compounds compounds 148 ordered by average z-score 149 150  we validated the hits from the primary screen by conducting a 10-point dose-response analysis with a drug 159 concentration range from 150 m down to 76 nm 3-fold dilution series from this dose-response analysis repurposing library using this approach we derived a docking score for each compound see table s1 181 for broad repurposing library with docking scores we observe a poor correlation pearson r002864 182 between mpro docking score and z-score in the protease inhibition assay fig 4a  furthermore top hits 183 from the screen also exhibit a weak correlation pearson r-01503 between compound potency and 184 docking score fig 4b  625nm final concentration in reaction buffer detailed above was added with a multiflo fx liquid 301 dispenser using a 5l cassette compounds were

various courses of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 based on single-cell rna sequencing data kai guo zhihan wang qinqin pu min wu   canhua huang junguk hur  with more than 38 million people infected coronavirus disease 2019  caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 poses a critical threat to human health there is no proven vaccine or specific drug to date which highlights the urgent need for rapid development of therapeutics for covid-19 to identify potentially repurposable drugs we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from us fda approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression perturbation data by chemicals from the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs project with publically available single-cell rna sequencing dataset from mild and severe covid-19 patients we identified 281 fda approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against sars-cov-2 infection 10 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against covid-19 in conclusion we have identified a list of repurposable anti-sars-cov-2 drugs using a systems biology approach  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease resulting from a life-threatening novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 it has spread rapidly throughout the globe causing 38 million infections and 260 thousand of deaths by early may 2020 1 2  sars-cov-2 is an enveloped rna virus that belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae which includes well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov as well as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 3  the advancement in the management of these coronaviruses and other viruses like influenza virus h1n1 and ebola infections have provided insight into treating covid-19 more than 300 active clinical trials for covid-19 are being performed 4 5  chloroquine 6 7 and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine 8  lopinavirritonavir 9 10 11  and remdesivir 7 12  developed for treating malaria human immunodeficiency virus hiv and ebola virus respectively have provided some benefits to treat covid-19 and are being tested in ongoing trials although covid-19 is less fatal than the sars and mers older patients with comorbidities tend to experience more severe symptoms making them more vulnerable the majority of sars-cov-2 infected patients displayed mild symptoms and generally have a good prognosis classified as mild covid-19 9 13  however a large proportion of patients especially among older men with underlying chronic diseases have rapidly progressed to severe covid-19 and suffered from respiratory distress requiring emergent medical interventions 14  unfortunately there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials supporting vaccines or efficient treatment for covid-19 4 5  additionally recent studies have shown the important roles of host immune responses in protection and the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections for instance sars-cov mers-cov and influenza a viruses 15 16  liao et al 17 reported that increased immune cell recruitment in covid-19 patients suggested a crucial role of cd8  t cells in successful viral control and proposed support therapeutic strategies that target the myeloid cell compartment to treat covid-19-associated inflammation however little is known about drug screens of disease-relevant cell types drug repurposing is an essential and universal strategy in the development of new drugs 18  it may facilitate the discovery of new mechanisms of action for existing drugs which is less time-consuming and cost-effective let alone the existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution 19 20  considering that an rna virus exhibits a considerable degree of sequence variation drugs targeting host factors may cause less mutational resistance with more effective and broad anti-virus spectrum potential hence there is an urgent need to identify potential therapeutics with new strategies for emerging infectious diseases and repurposing clinically assessed drugs represents one of the most practicable strategies for the rapid identification of treatments to combat covid-19 in this study we analyzed a publicly available single-cell rna sequencing scrna-seq dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf collected from mild and severe cases as well as bulk rna-seq of balf in covid-19 patients from different experiments  figure 1  data mining was performed by using the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs 21  a drug perturbation database to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease a total of 281 candidates of different courses of covid-19 independent of cell subtypes were identified 10 of which were in clinical trials of covid-19 including lopinavirritonavir 22  dexamethasone niclosamide lenalidomide hydrocortisone metformin atorvastatin sildenafil and verapamil subsequently we utilized the side effect prediction based on l1000 sep-l1000 project to predict adverse drug reactions adrs and constructed drug-adr association 23 24  our findings may aid in the rapid preclinical and clinical evaluation of these therapeutics and can provide an important drug discovery pipeline to accelerate and facilitate the development of potential treatments for covid-19 the gene-barcode matrix files of all 6 donors containing 3 mild cases and 3 severe cases lung balf and 3 healthy control lung tissues were downloaded from the ncbi gene expression omnibus database accession id gse145926 17  all expression matrices were loaded in r statistical analysis platform using seurat v3 25 and keeping cells with gene number between 200 and 6000 unique molecular identifier umi count above 1000 and mitochondrial gene percentage below 01 a total of 43914 cells collected from three healthy subjects three mild covid-19 patients and three severe covid-19 patients were used for the analyses we also collected a list of differentially expressed genes degs in sars-cov-2-infected lung balf using a bulk rna-seq analysis to compare against the single-cell-based data this deg list was obtained from the chinese national genomics data center httpsbigdbigaccn accession id cra002390 26  the lognormalize method in seurat was used for normalizing filtered gene-barcode matrix principal component analysis pca was done by using the top 2000 most variable genes then uniform manifold approximation and projection umap was performed on the top 50 principal components for visualizing the cells and graph-based clustering was performed on the pcareduced data with seurat v3 27  mast in seurat v3 was used to perform differential analysis degs were identified by comparing each cluster between all of the three groups genes with average log2fc  025 and adjusted p-value  005 were deemed as degs degs were first sorted by the log2fc values and then the upregulated and downregulated genes were chosen to identify drugs and compounds against the lincs database using the connectivity map linked user environment clue platform 21  the drug connectivity score cs with a negative value smaller than -90 was used to determine candidate drugs and compounds covid-19 database from the international clinical trials registry platform ictrp httpswwwwhointictrpen updated on may 5 th  2020 was searched for clinical trials information associated with these drugs both on-label and off-label adverse drug reactions adrs of the candidate drugs were collected from the sep-l1000 database httpsmaayanlabnetsep-l1000 the sep-l1000 data include on-label adrs of fda-approved drugs collected from sider 28 and off-label adrs from the pharmgkb database 29 based on the post-marketing adr reports in the fda adverse event report system faers our study highlighted the identification of different therapeutic effects in the varied disease course with the high variability of the cellular compartments underlying disease progression our drug repurposing profiles from major cell subtypes included t b and nk cells macrophages and epithelial cells a total of 9 scrna-seq balf samples including 3 healthy cases 3 mild cases and 3 severe cases were collected from publicly available scrna-seq data supplemental table s1  after quality filtering approximately 250000 gene expression values from 44000 cells were collected the clustering analysis identified six major clusters of macrophage nk figure s1  which was determined based on the unique signature genes cd68 macrophage cell il7r and cd4 cd4 t cell cd8a cd8 t cell ms4a1 b cells tppp3 epithelial cells respectively supplemental figure s2  we then compared these six major clusters across the healthy mild and severe covid-19 cases and identified differentially expressed genes between any of the two courses supplemental tables s2-s4  connecting to the lincs database of small-molecule perturbations on gene expression we identified candidate drugs and compounds that can reverse these upregulated and downregulated genes via the clue platform the closer the cs is to -100 a score indicating a complete reversal the higher chance identification of drug-adverse effect associations with upregulated or downregulated degs in other words drugs may show a better response to reverse expression of degs upregulated or downregulated in major cell subtypes in the balf there were a total of 281 candidates selected out by clue with cs lower than -90 based on degs among all three comparisons between two courses supplementary table s5  to enable prioritization of known drugs for preclinical and clinical

lestaurtinib obtained orphan drug approval from the fda for acute myeloid leukemia 41 and in a phase ii trial of advanced multiple myeloma and phase i trials of prostate cancer as shown in figures 3a  3b and supplemental table s5  lopinavir was the only one identified in all three comparisons and interestingly ritonavir was common in two analyses there were 23 additional common drugs such as

cannabinoid receptor inverse agonist producing anti-inflammatory effects 44  to further demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy we have accomplished the identification of therapeutic drugs by transcriptional changes in balf of covid-19 patients with a bulk rna-seq data 26  ten efficient candidates were identified using the same analysis pipeline two of which including glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor sb-216763 and ppar receptor antagonist gw-6471 were also included in the single-cell-based candidate lists supplemental table s12  further investigations are necessary to characterize the adrs which are a central consideration during drug development 45  therefore we conducted a computational approach using the sep-l1000 database to predictive relationships between drugs and the emergence of adrs supplemental tables s13 s14 figure 4 shows a heatmap of the top 50 drug-adr association for on-label  figure 4a  and off-label  figure 4b  adrs these findings highlighted drug-adr associations and may lead to inform clinical decisions regarding treatments for covid-19 covid-19 has spread rapidly and no proven vaccine or drug has yet been identified to treat it generally speaking there are several ways to control or prevent emerging coronavirus disease including antivirals small-molecule drugs biologics and vaccines 4 5  due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents and long development cycles of vaccines it is therefore reasonable to consider repurposing existing drugs and compounds for covid-19 drug repurposing is a potentially important strategy for the discovery of existing medicines to tackle covid-19 18  gordon et al 46 identified 332 high-confidence sars-cov-2human protein-protein interactions for drug repurposing an additional study 47 tested the antiviral activity of 20 fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 that previously shown to inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov another research team 48 conducted a high-throughput analysis of the reframe library to identify 30 candidates existing drugs that prevent the covid-19 virus from replicating in mammalian cells in a study 49 based on public data of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and the database lincs several drugs were identified on covd-19 targets ace2 host immune responses are particularly important in the protection and pathogenesis of the respiratory viral infections like sars-cov mers-cov and influenza a viruses 15 16  liao et al 17 observed that t and nk cells accumulated epithelial cells decreased in covid-19 patients compared to controls meanwhile macrophages dysregulated and the cell compartments differed in mild and severe disease courses more t and nk cells decreased in severe cases but cd8  t cells increased in mild cases however drug screening of disease-relevant cell types is still unclear here we analyzed publicly available data of covid-19 patients and performed data mining by using the lincs l1000 database to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease and sep-l1000 database to predict side effects our approach is different from previous methods for drug repurposing for coronavirus since it does not merely rapidly identify likely effective therapeutic agents in preventing or treating covid-19 but tries to filter out specific medications during the patients disease courses furthermore the data and transcriptome are derived from human samples from real patients two independent sets of experiments lastly we explore the underlying risk factors associated with some side effects of the candidates overall our data will guide the future development of therapies for the different durations of covid-19 and other viral respiratory infections this study has several limitations to note first the public scrna-seq data had a small number of clinical samples n9 without available patient information which makes comparisons between studies difficult with the fast pace and expected large number of published literature using other patient samples our candidate lists may need to be revised second our findings may not apply to children because all the sequencing data were from adults future work on large-scale data mining would help us in better identification of antiviral drugs the pandemic of covid-19 represents the greatest global public health crisis in this generation so far no proven vaccines and therapies have been identified based on the study we thoroughly investigated potential candidates for the treatment in covid-19 progression and predicted some possible adverse effects the findings can guide

novel beta coronavirus sars-cov-2 has significantly impacted global society from both an economic and public health standpoint as a result biomedical scientists around the world  from academic and government laboratories to biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical corporations  have mobilized to understand the disease to develop therapeutic interventions to mitigate its impact and to develop protective vaccines this rapid research response has resulted in the initiation of repurposing clinical trials for a range of agents including three that have received emergency use authorizations euas from the federal drug agency fda in the united states remdesivir1 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine these drugs and others that have entered clinical trials were prioritized based on clinical observations or a contemporary understanding of sars-cov-2 biology in addition numerous drug repurposing efforts have been undertaken screening both approved and experimental agents210 yet many published reports solely focus on active hits and do not disclose the majority usually 95 of tested compounds that were inactive  information that is critical for understanding and validating disease and drug mechanism-of-action and for nominating repurposed and novel clinical lead candidates rapid and open sharing of complete screening datasets including negative results will greatly accelerate the research and discovery process essential to the covid-19 pandemic response to address this the national center for advancing translational sciences ncats has developed an online open science data portal for its covid-19 drug repurposing campaign  named opendata  with the goal of making data across a range of sars-cov-2 related assays available in real-time figure 1 this approach allows researchers rapid access to drug repurposing datasets that can support subsequent mechanistic study of compounds that perturb viral infectivity11 in this manner open data sharing can facilitate important insight and associated publications towards the development of interventions against covid-19 the opendata dashboard first shared publicly on may 25 2020 makes quantitative high-throughput screening hts data and detailed protocol information available for every assay screened the goal is to provide clinicians and researchers with a user-friendly tool that allows direct comparison of compounds across multiple assays with all primary concentration-response data made freely available through direct download httpsopendatancatsnihgovcovid19 the assays that have been developed to date cover a wide spectrum of the sars-cov-2 life cycle figure 2 including both viral and human host targets grouped into the following five categories based on different mechanisms of experimental design viral entry viral replication in vitro infectivity live virus infectivity and counter-screens which could flag false positives due to assay interference artifacts or cytotoxic effects these assays encompass protein-based assays such as the sars-cov-2 spike protein-ace2 interaction and viral enzyme activity assays in addition to cell-based pseudotyped particle entry and live virus cytopathic effect assays as additional assays are validated and screened this list will be expanded and updated importantly all assay documentation including assay overview methodology and detailed assay protocols are available and readily retrievable on the opendata site to facilitate adoption and ensure that other laboratories can replicate these assays table 1 in total over 10000 compounds are being tested in full concentration-response ranges from across multiple annotated small molecule libraries including 1 the ncats pharmaceutical collection npc a library of 2678 compounds approved for use by the food and drug administration and related agencies in other countries1213 2 a collection of 739 anti-infective compounds with potential anti-coronavirus activity that have been reported in the literature as repurposing candidates and 3 an annotatedbioactive collection of diverse small molecules with known mechanisms of action including as small molecule probes and experimental therapeutics designed to modulate a wide range of targets such as natural products epigenetic-associated compounds or compounds developed for oncology indications1415 together these libraries yield 9958 compound responses 8624 of which represent structurally unique compounds of which 1820 21 are approved for use in humans with an additional 989 11 having entered human clinical evaluation phase 13 trials importantly of these unique compounds 5224 60 have at least one annotated target providing insight into potential mechanism-of-action underlying active compounds that perturb the sars-cov-2 life cycle in some manner a key goal of the opendata portal is to allow users to view and inspect the concentration-response data for all compounds screened not limited to only active compounds these complete datasets including full concentration-response information and compound annotations can be directly downloaded providing extensive information for further analysis and data mining in addition a user-friendly heatmap visualization has been implemented to allow direct and convenient comparison of compound activity across the panel of all assays tested including orthogonal and counter assays figure 3 currently the opendata portal can be queried by a search term eg drug name primary mechanism-of-action gene symbol and ordered by any assay data field for increased interpretability a high-level overview of compound activity across multiple different assays is displayed by heatmap with sort functions based on curve class efficacy and potency in the heatmap darker colors indicate compounds that are more potent and efficacious ie high-quality actives lighter colors indicate less potent and efficacious compounds low-quality actives beige represents inactive compounds and slashed boxes denote compoundsassays not yet tested in addition to the ncats covid-19 drug repurposing screening data described above two regularly updated external resource sections have also been incorporated into the opendata portal a collection of publications focusing on small molecule drug repurposing screens and a list of publicly available multiomics datasets generated to evaluate aberrant biochemical pathways or identify putative biomarkers for covid-19 in summary the opendata portal described herein has been designed to share ncats sars-cov-2 complete datasets openly and without restriction and importantly in real-time given the time urgency of covid-19 pandemic response in addition we have constructed the portal such that hts datasets from studies published by other investigators can be integrated into the portal to allow a global view of covid-19 drug repurposing efforts and enable comparison of screening hits across multiple centers we envisage this site could act as a central portal and a unique resource to compare complete repurposing data generated in both the public and private sectorsthe authors welcome contributions of external hts data we hope that this platform will help research scientists clinical investigators and public health officials to facilitate open data sharing and analysis to expedite the development of sars-cov-2 interventions and to prioritize promising compounds and repurposed drugs for further development in treating covid-19  current treatment options and the role of peptides as potential therapeutic components for middle east respiratory syndrome mers a review sabeena mustafa hanan balkhy musa gabere n   middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a respiratory disease caused by the mers coronavirus mers-cov 1 2 mers-cov was first reported in 2012 in saudi arabia and has spread to other countries mostly in the arabian peninsula united arab emirates qatar oman jordan kuwait yemen and lebanon as of march 2017 the world health organization who reported 1905 confirmed mers cases including 677 deaths in 27 countries mers spreads among people causing more severe complications which leads to death hence the need for the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic agents for its prevention and treatment it has been shown that a hospital outbreak of mers was due to human-to-human transmission 3 currently there is no registered treatment or vaccine for the disease but the mers-cov infection is rather managed by a drug treatment regime in addition to some preventive measures for infection and re-infection 4 several studies have demonstrated that a variety of therapeutics can inhibit mers-cov replication in cell culture 5 6 in this review we i summarize the important mers-cov drug targets ii present therapeutic options available for mers and describe their efficacies and iii discuss the role of peptide research in virology and the importance of antimicrobial peptides amps as potential therapeutic options for mers with the rapid development of computational biology approaches it is envisaged that novel and effective mers therapy could be developed using amps human coronaviruses are broadly classified as either alphacoronavirus or betacoronavirus mers-cov belongs to the betacoronavirus family 7 the causal transmission pathway of mers-cov has not been demonstrated 8 but it may have originated from bats with dromedary camels serving as intermediate hosts for human infection 9 mers-cov has been shown to modulate the innate immune response antigen presentation mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk and apoptotic pathways 10 the structure of mers-cov consists of four structural proteins as shown in fig 1
a including spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein the s protein is a type i transmembrane glycoprotein which is located at the viral envelope surface in a trimer state it consists of s1 and s2 subunits and plays a role in viral entry binding and fusion the s1 subunit has a receptor-binding domain rbd fig 1b the rbd is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 the s2 subunit involves two regions namely heptad repeats 1 and 2 hr1 and hr2 fig 1c and d which assemble into a complex called the fusion core and represents a key membrane fusion architecture 7 11 the e protein present mainly in the intracellular membranes of the virus 12 and plays a major role in viral assembly budding and intracellular trafficking 12 in 2013 surya et al reported that coronavirus e proteins are 76109 amino acids long and are predicted to have at least one -helical transmembrane 13 it was later found that the e protein has a total length of 82 amino acid residues 12 the m protein is a component of the viral envelope which plays a role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via its interactions with other viral proteins 14 the s m and e proteins are inserted into the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and get transported into the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi area in which they interact with the n proteins to form particles 15 this interaction will eventually interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes thus developing fusion peptides can be of great importance in peptide-based therapeutic options in addition mers-cov is comprised of two large polyproteins namely pp1a and pp1ab these polyproteins are further cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins nsps 16 two proteases papain-like protease plpro or nsp3 and 3c-like protease 3clpro or nsp5 are responsible for processing all 16 nsps which are required for replication and transcription 17 plpro is responsible for the cleavage at position 1-3 to develop three nsps whereas 3clpro cleaves the remaining positions 4-16 these nsps are responsible for viral rna-dependent rna polymerase activity nsp12 primase activity nsp8 rna helicase activity nsp13 exoribonuclease activity nsp14 endoribonuclease activity nsp15 and 2-o-methyltransferase activity nsp16 18 the 2-o-methyltransferase activity is stimulated by nsp10 which acts as an allosteric activator of nsp16 19 studies reveal that coronavirus nsps could be used as drug targets for developing new therapies 20 21 22 fig 1e shows the nsp5 3clpro protease bound with a designed inhibitor both the structural and non-structural proteins can act as therapeutic targets in which various therapeutic options have been implemented and will be discussed in sections various therapeutic agents against mers-cov infection and mechanism of action of peptides with antiviral activity against various coronaviruses repurposing is the method of targeting existing drug molecules to treat new diseases during repurposing a viable target profile is developed for the drug or receptor molecule and the screening of compounds from different molecule libraries can occur repurposing has become possible at a faster pace with the latest developments in computational biology rational design and development of novel and approved agents with potent antiviral activity repurposing of existing clinically fda approved drugs can be used to target viral entry high throughput screening of compounds and small molecules has helped researchers to evaluate large libraries of drugs for the in vitro antiviral activity against novel targets 24 25 the advantages of the repurposing method are i that it saves time and ii lowers the cost of developing a new drug 26 repurposed drugs may have potential antiviral effects against mers-cov examples of repurposed drugs that have shown anti-coronavirus validated activity include ribavirin hexachloropene nitazoxanide and homoharringtonine 27 ribavirin has been reported to have anti-mers-cov activity 28 but has adverse side effects with the occurrence of hemolysis 29 nitazoxanide has shown in vitro activity against mers-cov and other coronavirus infections by inhibiting expression of the viral nucleocapsid protein 30 in vitro studies show that cyclosporine inhibits mers-cov in human and monkey cell lines  a recent study by shih-chao et al tested the antiviral activities of resveratrol a phytocompound in grape seeds and red wine and showed that resveratrol could significantly inhibit mers-cov nucleocapsid expression 31 other examples of the use of small molecules as therapeutic options for mers-cov are given in table 1
 various studies have repurposed drugs by employing a hybrid of two or more drugs for example wilde et al employed alisporivir which inhibits the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov however they found that alisporivir in combination with ribavirin further enhanced the antiviral efficacy of alisporivir this was done using cell-culture based screening 32 another study showed that the combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1b was found to have an effect on marmosets infected with mers-cov 33 interferons have been shown to be potent inhibitors of mers-cov replication 33 however the combination of interferon-alpha 2b and ribavirin drugs routinely used to treat hepatitis c reduced mers-cov replication when administered to rhesus macaques 34 in addition ribavirin and interferon-alfa-2a were administered to patients with severe mers-cov infection and their survival improved 35 in another case report the lopinavirritonavir-based combination antiviral therapy was used for mers-cov infection in south korea 36 tawalah et al evaluated the virological and clinical progresses in response to lopinavirritonavir by administering different treatment options in mers patients this study suggested that the most effective therapeutic regimen was a low dose ribavirinpegylated interferon  combination 37 several studies have shown the effectiveness of ribavirin coupled with interferons 38 39 40 mycophenolic acid which is an immunosuppressant drug together with interferon-1b was found to have a strong inhibitory action against mers-cov the combination of mycophenolic acid and interferon-1b lowered the ec50
26 41 the use of convalescent plasma cp and whole blood therapy has been suggested to be a potential treatment for infectious diseases such as mers ebola and sars cp is the use of whole blood or plasma collected from patients that have recovered from viral diseases and has been used as a treatment during outbreaks 42 cp is therapeutically administered when there are no specific vaccines or drugs available for treating the diseases 43 arabi et al analysed the feasibility of cp therapy as well as its safety clinical and laboratory effects in critically ill patients with mers-cov infection they suggested that cp and other neutralizing antibodies have immunotherapeutic hyperimmune immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies potential for treatment of mers-cov infection however the study noted that large-scale screening would be required because of the limited availability of eligible potential donors with sufficient levels of antibodies 42 one drawback of cp is that it is unavailable and there is lack of evidence to prove its safety and efficacy 44 intravenous immunoglobulin ivig is a blood product prepared from serum which is generally used in treating a number of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions 45 the administration of ivig is well studied in various diseases including heart failure mycobacterial infection epilepsy alzheimers etc 46 during treatment these antibodies are administered intravenously and may lead to renal failure or thrombosis in mers patients 44 however there is no evidence that ivig has anti-mers activity luke et al reported a study in which transchromosomic tc bovines produced human polyclonal immunoglobulin g antibodies that neutralized mers-cov in both in vitro assays and animal models 47 the implication of this study shows that it potentially offers a method to manufacture therapeutic immunoglobulin to prevent andor treat mers-cov infection andor other new infectious diseases monoclonal antibodies mabs have been used to clinically diagnose various diseases for several years and are considered as a potential method of intervention monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against dpp4 have been reported to inhibit mers-cov infection in primary human bronchial epithelia cells and huh-7 cells 48 the lca60 antibody which was developed using cell clone technology from the immortalized b cells of a human donor recovering from mers is considered to be a treatment option for severe mers-cov infections 49 50 a recent study has identified and characterized a set of seven human neutralizing abs nabs 51 and two monoclonal antibodies mabs namely mers-4 and mers-27 52 these agents are rbd specific potent inhibitors and they show strong neutralizing activity against mers-cov another study succeeded in developing two potential antibodies regn3051 and regn3048 which have proven effective in animal models for mers-cov infection 53 other mabs that have shown activity against mers-cov include i 1e9 if8 3a1 3b12 3c12 3b11 and m14d3 54 ii 3b11-n 55 iii m336 m337 and m338 56 57 58 iv hms-159 and v 4c2 h 60 despite the utility the production of monoclonal antibodies are time consuming and difficult 61 other therapeutics that block mers-cov s-mediated cell entry and virus cell membrane fusion include cathespin inhibitors 62 tmprss2 inhibitors 63 furin inhibitors 64 kinase inhibitors 65 and ifitm proteins 66 a study in china used high flow nasal cannula hfnc for treating a patient with mers 67 in summary the above therapeutic options namely repurposing of clinically developed drugs cp and whole blood therapy ivig and use of monoclonal antibodies have advantages and disadvantages in terms of generation cost and overall applications this has led to interest in peptides as an alternative therapeutic option which will be discussed in the coming sections there is an interest in peptide therapeutics and their mimetics as potential antagonists for various pathogens peptide research is an important aspect in pharmaceutical research and approximately 140 peptide therapeutics are currently being evaluated in clinical trials 72 the reasons for using peptides are i that they inhibit protein-protein interactions ii they can be used as an alternative for diseases that are difficult to target iii there are advance techniques to improve peptide half-life and iv they have a shorter market time 73 peptide drugs have little side effects and little drug tolerance compared with chemical drugs meanwhile the specificity of treatment is high peptide drugs need special storage conditions otherwise the protein function becomes inactive causing low oral bioavailability and the propensity to be rapidly metabolized 74 many peptide inhibitors have shown activity against viruses 75 76 77 for instance the rvfv-6 peptide which is derived from the membrane proximal stem region of the rvfv glycoprotein gc prevents the viral fusion in rift valley fever virus 78 the rvfv-6 peptide is not only specific to the rift valley fever virus and closely related variants but also shows activity against unrelated viruses such as ebov and vsv 78 79 scorpion venom peptide derivative kn2-7 was identified as a potential anti-hiv-1 peptide which shows very low cytotoxic effects in biological assays 80 the lack of effective treatment has encouraged the development of additional therapeutic agents with increased efficacy to overcome adverse side effects that occur with the current mers treatment there has been a growing interest in the field of peptide therapeutics over the last decade due to numerous adverse effects of chemical based drugs 81 amps are excellent candidates as novel therapeutic agents since they have been reported to possess anti-coronavirus activity 82 amps are components of the first line of defence of the immune system produced by both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species they are small positively charged gene encoded peptides which have selective toxicity towards gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria protozoa fungi and viruses 83 84 85 86 their selective toxicity is due to the fact that the microbes membrane bilayer is rich in lipopolysaccharides lps and lipoteichoic acid lpa thus is negatively charged in contrast to the positive charge of the amps 85 antiviral amps have several modes of actions including the blocking of viral entry by heparan sulphate interaction inhibition of viral entry by fusing with specific cellular receptors and stopping viral fusion by interacting with glycoproteins membrane and envelope of the virus 87 coronaviruses enter target cells by inducing fusion between the viral and cellular membranes a process mediated by the viral spike s glycoprotein 89 the s1 subunit of the s protein facilitates receptor binding 90 whereas the s2 subunit is responsible for driving viral and target cell membrane fusion 91 there are various approaches in creating peptide-based therapeutics including peptides that interrupt rbd interaction peptides that block the hr1 and hr2 interaction from forming a fusion-active core and peptides that interfere with the cleavage of the s protein 92 strategies have been employed to inhibit fusion of the s protein by either deriving peptides from hr1 and hr2 regions of the s or by deriving peptides from an antimicrobial peptide note that peptides derived from either s protein or antimicrobial peptides are both antiviral compounds the only difference is that peptides derived from antimicrobial peptides can be broad spectrum may have other roles such as immunomodulatory activity 93 and is derived from other organism other than virus these are described as followsapeptides derived from hr1 hr2 and rbd subunits of the spike protein
 fusion inhibiting peptides derived from the s protein are shown in table 2
a for example lu et al designed two synthetic peptides hr1p and hr2p that have amino acid residues spanning 998-1038 in hr1 and 1251-1286 in hr2 domains which form a stable six-helical bundle 6-hb fusion core structure 94 this 6-hb structure ensures the fusion of the viral envelope and the host cell membrane 95 of the two peptides hr2p inhibits both mers-cov replication and its spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion 94 a previous study showed the derivation of five regions that span the length of the s2 subunits of sars-cov and murine hepatitis virus mhv in this study three peptides sarsww-iii sarsww-iv and mhvww-iv exhibited antiviral activity greater than the other peptides studied with inhibitory concentration ic50 values ranging from 24 m 96bpeptides derived from antimicrobial peptides
 peptides can be derived from antimicrobial peptides by either truncating the fragments of the original peptide or replacing a certain residue of an amp with another residue for instance replacement of lysine with arginine these derived peptides have shown activities against various micro-organisms 97 98 for instance the antiviral activity of 11 peptides derived from mouse -defensin-4 was tested and one of them p9 exhibited potent and broad spectrum antiviral effects against multiple respiratory viruses in vitro and in vivo including influenza a virus h1n1 h3n2 h5n1 h7n7 h7n9 sars-cov and mers-cov 99 the entry and replication process of coronaviruses in the infected host commences by the s glycoprotein located on the surface of the coronavirus virion fusing with receptor ace2 or dpp4 to facilitate viral entry into the host a chain of events leads to the release of viral genomic rna into the host cytoplasm replication of the viral rna and final release of viral particles 18 100 several studies have been employed to inhibit viral entry and replication which are shown in table 2b and c these peptides can be classified into major subgroupsapeptides derived from hr1 and hr2 subunits of the spike protein
 the hr2p peptide was derived from the hr2 domain hr2p has shown activity against mers-cov by inhibiting viral replication in calu-3 and hfl cells 94bpeptides derived from antimicrobial peptides
 mutant mucropin-m1 is a peptide derived from mucropin amp the glycine and proline residues of mucropin were substituted with lysine and arginine respectively mutant mucropin-m1 has shown activity against sars-cov by inhibiting viral replication 101cpeptides derived from non-structural protein nsp
 two peptides k12 and k29 were derived from the non-structural protein nsp10 of sars-cov these two peptides inhibit the replication of sars-cov with an inhibitory concentration of 160 m 102 though much is not known about the assembly and release process or enzymes involved in assembly or release process inhibition of assembly and release of virus could be a good future target 103 other examples of anti-coronavirus peptides against sars-cov tgev and mhv are provided in an antiviral peptide database avpdb 82 this database consists of various anti-coronavirus peptides with numerous mechanisms of action against sars-cov tgev and mhv and can be employed as potential therapeutic options for mers-cov because coronaviruses share a similar structure and mechanism of action 39 our understanding of peptide research suggests that peptides may have the capacity to be lead molecules as potential drugs against mers the advantage of peptide repurposing is that it will lead to the identification of peptide-based therapeutics for the treatment of mers with potentially wider utility of therapeutics use for the treatment of infections caused by the different human coronaviruses furthermore this can help to maintain the quality and reduce the cost of new medicine development there is an urgent need for developing the most effective mers therapy and developing protocols to be used in randomized-controlled trials studies have shown that peptides have evolved as highly potent signal transduction agents for viral diseases we suggest that amps can be a successful therapeutic option for emerging mers pathogen computational biology coupled with virology can accelerate the most advanced design by developing peptide therapeutics against mers-cov with greater efficacy in addition our study suggests that the repurposing of existing and clinically approved anti-coronavirus and anti-viral peptide drugs may be used as promising leads for the development of new anti-mers-cov agents this work was supported by king abdullah international medical research center grant rc16089 none declared not required  potentially repurposable drugs for covid-19 identified from sars-cov-2 host protein interactome kalyani karunakaran b n balakrishnan madhavi ganapathiraju   covid19 coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious virus outbreak which rapidly developed into a pandemic health crisis the novel coronavirus sars-cov2ncov19 is the causative agent of this disease1 several groups responded to the urgent need for effective therapeutics by leading systems-level efforts to identify drugs repurposable for covid19 through the lens of the virus-host protein interactome2 and the interactomes of sars-cov2-modulated host proteins3 and host proteins modulated by other human corona viruses such as sars-cov mers-cov hcov229e and hcov-nl634 repurposing or finding alternate uses for approved drugs has proved to be a better strategy than de novo identification in terms of time and cost effectiveness57 discovery of therapeutic agents for infectious diseases in the past was largely serendipitous and focused on screening and prioritizing drugs that target the viral system8 over the last few years the focus has shifted towards computationally identifying drugs that could counter the virus attack a primary strategy is to repurpose drugs with the ability to revert the genes differentially expressed in the host upon viral infection to their normal levels ie to revert the host transcriptional profile induced upon viral infection to its normal state8 this inverse genomic signature approach involves identifying drugs that induce gene expression profiles negatively correlated with host-specific gene signatures induced by viral infection and has been used to select candidates repurposable against influenza viruses and mers-cov911 availability of disease-associated and drug-induced transcriptomic profiles in online repositories such as ncbi geo gene expression omnibus and cmap connectivity map1213 allow these profiles to be compared using bioinformatics data analysis software suites such as the basespace correlation engine14 changes in the host transcriptome induced by viral infection are also reflected in the host proteome specifically as perturbations in the interaction networks of the host proteins this complex network of protein-protein interactions ppis called the interactome has the potential to restrict viral replication in host cells or conversely to be taken over by the virus for its replication we had previously presented the host protein interactome hop interactome of 332 human proteins identified to interact with 27 sars-cov2 viral proteins by gordon et al215 this interactome consisting of 6076 ppis of the host proteins including 1941 novel interactions predicted by hippip provided an integrated view on how host genes in various high throughput covid19 and sars transcriptomicproteomic studies are functionally linked15 in this study we identified drugs targeting the proteins in this interactome and studied the correlation of the gene expression profiles induced by these drugs in various cell lines with sarscovid-associated profiles observed in lung-derived mrc5 calu3 nhbe and a549 cell lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs of sars patients our work differs from previous efforts to identify drugs repurposable for covid1924 in that it considers the host protein interactome and includes computationally predicted novel interactors of the host proteins which may lead to identification of drugs that were hitherto not prioritized we compared drug-induced versus sars-associated differential expression using the basespace correlation engine previously called nextbio httpswwwnextbiocom1617 to identify drugs for ncov19 we compiled a list of 933 chemical compounds whose differential gene expression profile drug versus no drug were negatively correlated with at least one of the four sars differential gene expression datasets infected versus non-infected the 4 sars datasets we studied were calu3 epithelial cells infected for 48 hours with sars coronavirus versus mock infected cells gse17400 calu3 lung cells infected for 72 hours with sars cov urbani versus mock infected cells gse37827 lung fibroblast mrc5 cells 24 hours post sars coronavirus infection high multiplicity of infection moi versus mock infection gse56189 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from patients with sars versus healthy subjects gse173918 we also compiled a list of 381 chemical compounds with gene expression profiles negatively correlated with the profile induced in human bronchial epithelial nhbe and lung cancer a549 cells infected with the sars-cov2 strain usa-wa12020 gse14750719 although in each case there would be some genes that are differentially expressed in the same direction for both the drug and the disease ie both cause some genes to overexpress or both cause some genes to under express the overall effect on the entire transcriptome would be an anti-correlation a correlation score is generated by nextbio based on the strength of the overlap between the drug and disease datasets statistical criteria such as correction for multiple hypothesis testing are applied and the correlated datasets are then ranked by statistical significance a numerical score of 100 is assigned to the most significant result and the scores of the other results are normalized with respect to this top-ranked result next we identified 1130 drugs that target at least one protein in the hop interactome using webgestalt20 we used the redundancy reduction feature provided by webgestalt to prioritize drugs with highly significant overlaps with the interactome while also capturing all the unique target gene sets this feature used an affinity propagation algorithm which clusters sets of genes in the interactome targeted by specific drugs using jaccard index as the similarity metric and identifies a representative for each cluster one drug and its targets having the most significant p-value among all the gene sets in that cluster this resulted in 209 drugs for further consideration given a class of drugs targeting the same set of proteins this method ensures that only those individual drugs that target a statistically significant number of proteins in the interactome are prioritized for further analysis fifty-six drugs were found in common to the above two analyses ie these drugs not only targeted genes in the hop interactome but also induced gene expression profiles which are negatively correlated with that induced by sars-cov supplementary table s1 and sars-cov2 supplementary table s2 thirteen drugs showed negative correlation with both expression profiles twenty-four of the fifty six have supporting evidence for biological relevance through clinical trial data and published literature figure 1 in the list below three drugscyclosporine sorafenib and tamoxifenhave multiple evidences and are shown italicized after 1st occurrence 8 drugs from our shortlist were independently identified or prioritized by other groups namely sirolimus zhou et al4 leflunomide quercetin and verapamil barabsi et al3 interferon alfa2b resveratrol cyclosporine and mycophenolic acid li et al21 additionally eight out of the 24 shortlisted drugs were also found among 127 broad-spectrum antiviral drugs active against 80 viruses httpsdrugvirusinfo these are cyclosporine leflunomide mycophenolic acid sirolimus sorafenib tamoxifen anisomycin and verapamil cyclosporine sorafenib tamoxifen and anisomycin were identified to have inhibitory effects on sars-cov2 in four independent cell-based assays2225 these drugs have also been shown to be effective against viruses similar to sars-cov2 or other viruses cyclosporine in combination with interferon alpha reduced mers-cov replication and this reduction was associated

ramipril is an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme ace1 which belongs to the class of entry receptors targeted by ncov19 current evidence shows that the spike protein of sars-cov2 binds to ace2 and not ace137 even though the two enzymes are coded by homologous genes ace1 inhibitors are incapable of acting on ace2 and the physiological actions of ace1 differ from that of ace2 vasoconstriction versus vasodilation however since these enzymes function in two counterbalancing arms of the renin-angiotensin system more investigations are necessary to ascertain whether ace1 has some as yet unidentified role in viral pathogenesis38
quercetin inhibits the infection of various influenza viruses including h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 and it is suspected that this inhibition arises from their interaction with the viral ha2 hemagglutinin subunit39 the calcium channel blocker verapamil inhibits the influenza virus late in their replication cycle in madin-darby canine kidney cells and in murine pulmonary macrophages40

versus disease-associated gene expression profiles although this approach has been validated in the past it has several limitations drug associated expression profiles analyzed in this study were induced in several types of cell lines including cancer cell lines that may not be directly relevant to covid19 or sars-cov2 infection the effect of the proposed repurposable drugs should be studied in human bronchial epithelial cells andor in human lung cancer cell lines both of which were recently used to study host transcriptional response upon sars-cov2 infection19 in summary we showed that drugs repurposable for covid19 can be identified from the host protein interactome based on gene expression profiles induced by the drug versus those associated with the disease the dissemination of

articles written in english that fulfilled the following criteria were included in the analysis i described testing of potential inhibitors of any sars-cov-2 structural or non-structural proteins ii included screening of potential inhibitor drugs from a drug library containing united states food and drug administration fda approved drugs or pre-selected list that included cefuroxime and iii identified cefuroxime as a top-ranked top x drugs where x   20 potential inhibitor drug studies with any of the following were excluded from analysis i articles that did not report results of primary

disagreements were resolved by consensus between the two investigators the final selected articles were reviewed data extracted and the methodology and findings were summarized in this paper the primary study outcome was to identify and summarize in silico evidence that suggest a molecular basis of possible activity of cefuroxime against sars-cov-2 data from each eligible study were extracted by the two investigators extracted data included the name of first author country of origin of corresponding author peer reviewed status methodological approach software tool used fda approved drugs or drug library screened sars-cov-2 protein targets and cefuroxime rank four studies al-khafaji et al 2020 almciga-daz et al 2020 jorge galvez et al 2020 koulgi et al 2020 reported cefuroxime as a top-ranked inhibitor drug for mpro galvez and colleagues jorge galvez et al 2020 employed a molecular topology mt methodology that has been successful in identifying drugs for cancer alzheimers disease and malaria j galvez et al 2012 the mt approach involves representing the structure and by extension the pharmacologic activity of drugs or molecules by a set of numbers called topological indices based on topological indices drugs can be partitioned into groups that have similar mathematical patterns a mathematical model or topological model is trained to learn a desired mathematical pattern once validated the topological model can be used to search drug libraries to identify other drugs that have the desired mathematical pattern hence the desired pharmacologic activity j galvez et al 2012 jorge galvez et al 2020 galvez and colleagues took lopinavir the hiv-1 protease that was predicted in some studies to have activity against mpro as a gold standard drug using the mt approach they screened about 15000 molecules from 2 drug libraries and identified 22 other drugs including cefuroxime that are predicted to bind tighter than lopinavir the predicted inhibitory potency of these drugs was expressed by an arbitrary index lopinavir had an index score of 29 while cefuroxime had an index score of 39 almeciga-diaz and colleagues almciga-daz et al 2020 used a proprietary algorithm almciga-diaz et al 2019 to screen a subset of zinc library for drugs that could bind to the active cavity of mpro prior to screening they demonstrated that their algorithm correctly predicted the binding of a number of inhibitor molecules that have been reported for mpro including n3 and -ketonamide-based inhibitors they observed a very strong correlation r2  089 between the binding energy and reported ic50of these inhibitors consequently they predicted ic50 based on binding energy from screening of over 11000 drugs they identified 10 potential inhibitor drugs including cefuroxime that had smaller binding energy than the previously reported inhibitors cefuroxime ranked 8th and was predicted to bind with affinity energy of -92 kcalmol with an ic50 of 209 m the top-ranked drug had an affinity energy of -98 kcalmol and an ic50 of 184 m koulgi and colleagues koulgi et al 2020 using both a direct docking and an ensemble docking approach the direct docking was a straightforward docking of potential drugs against the crystal structure of mpro while the ensemble approach involved docking against variations in conformation of the active site of mpro which usually leads to better results to achieve the ensemble approach they performed molecular dynamic simulation mds via root mean square deviation rmsd based clustering and markov state modeling analysis to obtain 16 conformations of mpro grid scores for drugs in two drug libraries one of which was the official fda approved drug list were reported for both approaches expectedly the ensemble approach produced better docking scores cefuroxime via trade name of ceftin was identified as the second-best drug from the fda drug library via the ensemble approach with a grid score of -4933 this score was better than a score of -4605 for the best ranked drug from the direct docking approach al-khafaji and colleagues al-khafaji et al 2020 employed covalent docking screening to identify potential drugs that could bind covalently hence irreversibly to cys145 of the active site of mpro cys145 of mpro has been identified as a vital residue that can be covalently bound by drugs to inhibit activity of mpro dai et al 2020 xue et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 to this end they obtained the crystal structures of 48 pre-screened fda-approved drugs and antiviral agents including cefuroxime that are known to bind covalently to targets the drugs were ranked by their binding energies that was determined using prime mm-gbsa genheden  ryde 2015 they concluded that the top 8 drugs showed a higher affinity to form covalent irreversible bond with cys145 of the active site of mpro cefuroxime was the 5th highest ranking drug with a binding energy of -5425 kcalmol while remdesivir ranked third with a binding energy of -6519 kcalmol wu et al wu et al 2020 was one of the earliest and one of the most cited paper on in silico experiments for sars-cov-2 as at the time of writing this paper the authors screened fda-approved drugs from zinc database and a database of known antiviral agents against active sites all sars-cov-2 proteins drug candidates were scored based on the well established internal coordinate mechanics icm abagyan et al 1994 the binding energies of potential drug candidates were expressed as icm scores and icm mfscores mean force scores the icm score is a measure of the overall empirical function of the predicted physical interaction while the icm mfscore is an independent score of the strength of drug-receptor interaction abagyan et al 2020 muegge  martin 1999 neves et al 2012 per the icm user guide the score is considered the best scoring to use for docking result analysis and icm scores less than -32 are generally considered to be good scores abagyan et al 2020 wu and colleagues considered drug candidates with icm scores less than -30 or icm mfscores less than -110 to have potential activity against targeted proteins of sars-cov-2 cefuroxime was among top-ranked drugs was predicted to inhibit rdrp from the icm score data provided in supplementary files against rdrp cefuroxime had an icm score of -4130 which was the highest and mfscore of -6304 remdesivir had a score of -274 and a mfscore of -113 although excluded for not meeting eligibility criteria we report a study elfiky 2020 that also reported potential binding of cefuroxime to rdrp the author conducted mds with molecular docking to investigate the binding of a handful of pre-selected drugs including antiviral agents and cefuroxime to rdrp the average binding energy for cefuroxime at -6875 kcalmol was within the margin of error of remdesivir at -716 kcalmol darya and colleagues darya et al 2020 predicted that cefuroxime may inhibit the ace2-spike complex first they created a resource called polypharmdb that contained the predicted binding profiles of over 10000 approved and experimental drugs the resource was built using a proprietary tool matchmaker that uses artificial intelligence via deep learning to predict the binding of drugs to about 8700 human and viral proteins polypharmdb was then queried for potential drugs that could inhibit sars-cov-2 proteins of interest which revealed cefuroxime as a top 5 drugs that may inhibit ace2-spike protein complex covid-19 pandemic is a major public health threat that requires immediate action despite the intense efforts to develop novel drugs for sars-cov2 this process is time consuming with limited progress to date therefore drug repurposing has been identified as the fastest way of realizing therapeutic agents for covid-19 to meet the urgency of the situation there has been anecdotal evidence suggesting various drugs may be effective against sars-cov-2 prospective studies investigating initially touted agents such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have failed to show whether hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin can effectively alter the disease course in patients with severe covid-19 taccone et al 2020 however preliminary data analysis from a national institutes of health nih sponsored randomized clinical trial rct for remdesivir involving patients with advanced covid-19 suggested that patients who received remdesivir had a significant 4-day difference in median time to recovery compared to those who received placebo national institutes of health 2020 therefore in-keeping with its commitment to expediting the development and availability of potential covid-19 treatments the fda issued an emergency use authorization on 1st may 2020 for remdesivir to be used for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed covid-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease us food  drug administration 2020 the potential mortality benefit of remdesivir is less clear with a clinical trial from china showing no mortality benefit y wang et al 2020 and conclusive results from the nih trial being awaited nevertheless the preliminary results of the nih trial suggest that the virus can be inhibited in vivo resulting in clinically meaningful outcomes despite this early success many unanswered questions remain about remdesivir including its availability route of administration exists only in intravenous form cost and indication for use in non-severe hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients for these reasons additional therapeutic agents are needed in the fight against sars-cov-2 in this study we set out to determine if there was a molecular basis for possible activity of cefuroxime against sars-cov-2 by conducting a scoping review of literature of in silico drug-repurposing experiments against sars-cov-2 we identified 6 original articles from 4 continents that from a large library of existing drugs reported cefuroxime as a top-ranked potential inhibitor of 3 key sars-cov-2 proteins four studies reported that cefuroxime may inhibit mpro one study reported cefuroxime may inhibit rdrp while another reported cefuroxime may inhibit the ace2-spike protein binding complex these findings suggest that there is an in silico basis to assume cefuroxime may be active against sars-cov-2 although not previously known to have anti-viral activity glaxosmithkline 2019 given the reported strong binding to 3 sars-cov-2 proteins in silico cefuroxime may be a multi-target inhibitor of sars-cov-2 multi-target agents carry the prospect of being more robust and more likely to live up to expectations as they tend to be less affected by individual differences in response modifications in key disease- relevant biological pathways and the activation of compensatory mechanism talevi 2015 xie et al 2012 zimmermann et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge this is the first review to suggest cefuroxime as a possible weapon in the fight against sars-cov-2 however the clinical usefulness of cefuroxime for covid-19 will depend on its clinical efficacy and safety profile to determine clinical efficacy phase iiiii clinical trials are needed regarding safety cefuroxime has a good profile the most common adverse drugs reactions are gastrointestinal effects nausea vomiting and diarrhea and these effects are dose dependent occurring with higher doses and longer duration of use emmerson 1988 henry et al 1995 in one large study gastrointestinal adverse effects were seen in less than 5 of patients with only 22 discontinuing use predominantly due to gastrointestinal side effects perry  brogden 1996 consequently one concern that may arise with its use for covid-19 is the possibility of exacerbation of gastrointestinal symptoms of covid-19 a systematic reviewmeta-analysis of 60 studies of gastrointestinal symptoms of covid-19 reported a pooled prevalence of 176 with higher prevalence 171 in patients with severe disease than patients with non-severe disease 118 the most commonly reported symptoms were anorexia 268 diarrhea 125 nausea and vomiting 102 and abdominal pain 92 cheung et al 2020 therefore if cefuroxime were prescribed for covid-19 worsening gastrointestinal symptoms would suggest either disease progression or adverse drug effects the two of which can be distinguished by presence of symptoms such as dry cough shortness of breath loss of smell loss of taste which are seen with covid-19 but not with cefuroxime other adverse effects of cefuroxime occur less commonly and have been estimated to occur in between 01 to 1 of subjects over several multiple-dose trials glaxosmithkline 2019 besides the possibility of being an inhibitor of sars-cov-2 there may be additional benefit to using cefuroxime for covid-19 though actual numbers may vary it is not uncommon for patients with covid-19 to have suspected or confirmed bacterial super-infection or co-infection requiring antibiotic coverage a single site study zhou et al 2020 from china reported 15 prevalence of secondary bacterial infection among hospitalized patients while a rapid review of literature of bacterial and fungal co-infection among covid-19 patients rawson et al 2020 reported 8 bacterialfungal co-infection nevertheless up to 70 of hospitalized patients received empiric antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection cox et al 2020 rawson et al 2020 since cefuroxime is a broad spectrum antibiotic with excellent activity against many respiratory pathogens it is reasonable to consider it as an option for empiric therapy in suspected cases of bacterial super-infectionco-infection particularly for patients with mild disease non-hospitalized patients or hospitalized patients without respiratory compromise pending the isolation of a specific pathogen patients with moderate-to-severe disease with suspicion of bacterial super-infection will likely benefit from broader empiric coverage than offered by cefuroxime as they are at a higher risk of mortality lippi  plebani 2020 zhou et al 2020 there are certain limitations in our scoping review that should be acknowledged first there was significant heterogeneity among the studies we reviewed especially with regards the methodology while this can be regarded as a strength this also hints at need for reproducibility second only studies that reported cefuroxime as a top-ranked drug were included in this study there are many other studies that did not identify cefuroxime as a top-ranked drug consequently it is unclear if the 6 studies included in this review represent a significant finding in the larger body of literature on in silico drug repurposing for covid-19 an early systematic review of in silico drug repurposing for coivd-19 identified 21 studies mohamed et al 2020 which included one paper in this study since then several studies have been published consequently new systematic reviews are needed to evaluate the significance of our findings third this was a review of in silico studies further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to determine the efficacy of cefuroxime and its potential as a therapeutic agent against sars-cov-2 covid-19 is a significant public health emergency that carries a pressing demand for an effective therapeutic due to the urgency of this health crisis drug repurposing is the most efficient method of meeting this need successful interventions may require action on multiple targets of the sars-cov-2 virus the second-generation cephalosporin cefuroxime demonstrates potential activity against three sars-cov-2 proteins in in silico experiments and may be a promising multi-target inhibitor cefuroximes long history of population monitoring makes it a reliable option for further in vitro and in vivo studies in the fight against covid-19  potential covalent drugs targeting the main protease of the sars-cov-2 coronavirus sen liu qiang zheng zhiying wang  since december 2019 the newly identified coronavirus sars-cov-2 has caused a massive health crisis worldwide and resulted in over 70000 covid-19 infections so far clinical drugs targeting sars-cov-2 are urgently needed to decrease the high fatality rate of confirmed covid-19 patients traditional de novo drug discovery needs more than 10 years so drug repurposing seems the best option currently to find potential drugs for treating covid-19 results compared with traditional non-covalent drugs covalent drugs have attracted escalating attention recent years due to their advantages in potential specificity upon careful design efficiency and patient burden we recently developed a computational protocol named as scar for discovering covalent drugs in this work we used the scar protocol to identify possible covalent drugs approved or clinically tested targeting the main protease 3clpro of sars-cov-2 we identified 11 potential hits among which at least 6 hits were exclusively enriched by the scar protocol since the preclinical or clinical information of these identified drugs is already available they might be ready for being clinically tested in the treatment of covid-19  starting december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause took place in wuhan hubei province of china chaolin huang et al 2020  in a short time chinese authorities rapidly isolated and characterized a novel coronavirus closely related to the sars-cov that caused the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome 18 years ago in china zhou et al 2020  the newly identified coronavirus was initially represented by 2019-ncov but formally named as sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv on february 12 th  2020 meanwhile the disease caused by this virus was named as covid-19 by the world health organization who although china has adopted unprecedented policies to control the spread of the virus including temporarily shutting down the wuhan city on january 23 rd  2020 sars-cov-2 has resulted in over 70000 covid-19 patients and more than 2000 fatalities worldwide by february 20 th  2020 with an estimated case fatality rate of 2-3 and the growing patient numbers sars-cov-2 poses a serious health threat to the whole world httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports unfortunately specific clinical treatments for the rapidly escalating international crisis caused by sars-cov-2 are very limited which is one of the reasons of the high mortality rate due to the deficiency of targeted drugs the current clinical treatment of covid-19 focuses on supportive care and symptom relief remdesivir an experimental drug developed to treat the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has been reported to be effective in treating several covid-19 cases but a systematic clinical trial of this drug is still ongoing in wuhan china clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04257656 similarly chloroquine lopinavirritonavir and many other drugs have also been reported to be potentially effective but supportive clinical data are not available for all maxmen 2020  therefore it is of great value to identify more potential drugs targeting sars-cov-2 to save covid-19 patients in the traditional process the development of a drug will need over 15 years from target identification target validation hit discovery lead optimization and preclinical and clinical trials kaitin 2010  therefore it is virtually not possible to develop de novo drugs in the time frame needed to impact the current sars-cov-2 crisis hence the most feasible approach is to find potential cures from clinical drugs by drug repurposing also known as drug repositioning reprofiling redirecting or rediscovering drug repurposing can rapidly expand target disease indications of an existing drug while saving time and money since the data for human pharmacokinetics safety and the preclinical results are already available cha et al 2018  successful examples of drug repurposing include the use of sildenafil in treating erectile dysfunction and the anti-cancer uses of thalidomide pushpakom et al 2019  previously we described a computer-aided drug discovery protocol named as scar steric-clashes alleviating receptors ai et al 2016 for the screening of covalent inhibitors of target proteins enlightened by the in silico protein design strategy liao et al 2015  realizing the potential use of scar in discovering both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors we recently demonstrated that scar is also quite efficient in drug repurposing y zhang et al 2020  compared with non-covalent drugs covalent drugs have the following advantages mah et al 2014  i covalent drugs have better biochemical efficiency since they are more competitive than many non-covalent endogenous substrates and cofactors ii covalent drugs cause lower patient burden and delay the emergence of drug resistance due to lower and less frequent dosing iii covalent drugs might have better target specificity by reacting with a non-conserved nucleophilic amino acid with careful designs cuesta et al 2020  therefore recent years have witnessed the resurgence of the discovery of covalent drugs as a result we set out to use scar to identify possible covalent drugs targeting sars-cov-2 by drug repurposing in this work the protein pocket is shown in surface and the inhibitor in sticks the covalent bond is indicated by the arrow b the binding poses of the identified hits the putative reactive atoms in the drugs are indicated by black arrows the protein without the scar mutation c145g was used for representation and the yellow surface close to the arrow represents cys145 the steric conflicts between the reactive atoms and cys145 are expected which can be eliminated by the covalent bonding between the drug and cys145 table 1 the potential drugs that might be repurposed as covalent inhibitors of the sars-cov-2 3clpro from the scar strategy docking score and conformation rank are listed for the identified pose atom distance is the distance between the putative reactive atom of the drug and cys145-sg scar enriching score is calculated as the top docking score of the drug docked to the wild-type 3clpro minus the listed docking score  the structure files of the compounds were downloaded as mol2 files from the zinc15 database httpzinc15dockingorg as described by zinc15 the 3d conformations were protonated at physiological ph and biologically relevant tautomers were generated for each molecule sterling and irwin 2015  the in-trials catalog 2019-04-22 version was downloaded which contains 5811 approved or investigational clinically tested but not approved drugs worldwide mgltools version 156 was used to generate the pdbqt files from the mol2 files for docking the sars-cov-2 3clpro structure was downloaded from pdb pdb id 6lu7 this is a complex structure of the sars-cov-2 3clpro and an inhibitor covalently bonding to cys145 the structure was energetically minimized in rosetta leaver-fay et al 2011 by applying harmonic distance and angle constraints on the bonding atoms in the inhibitor and cys145 the backbone of the protein was fixed during the minimization the lowest score model was chosen from 1000 models for scar docking the cys145 was mutated to gly mgltools version 156 was used to generate the pdbqt file for docking the computational docking process was similar as previously described ai et al 2016 liao et al 2015  briefly autodock vina trott and olson 2010 version 112 was used to dock the small molecules to the substrate binding pocket of the sars-cov-2 3clpro the docked poses were then manually evaluated by docking score ranking and the distance between the reactive atom and the sulfur atom of cys145 in the original structure as previously described ai et al 2016  in sars-cov the 3c-like proteinase 3clpro is the main protease which cleaves the large replicase polyprotein 1a pp1a and pp1ab to produce non-structural proteins nsps for the transcription and replication of the virus zumla et al 2016  therefore 3clpro is a key drug target in inhibiting sars-cov the recent data showed that the sars-cov-2 3clpro is highly similar with the sars-cov 3clpro both in sequence and structure pdb id 6lu7 previous studies demonstrated that cys145 is a key residue in the active site of 3clpro changkang huang et al 2004  which makes this residue be an attractive target for covalent bonding of covalent 3clpro inhibitors cysteine is also a most popular target of covalent inhibitors because its high intrinsic reactivity at physiological ph permits the use of relatively unreactive electrophiles cuesta et al 2020  meanwhile targeting cysteine renders the high selectivity of covalent inhibitors due to the low prevalence of cysteine in the proteome cuesta et al 2020  to repurpose potential covalent drugs targeting the sars-cov-2 3clpro we firstly optimized the x-ray complex structure of this protein with its inhibitor using the macromolecule modeling suite rosetta leaver-fay et al 2011  figure 1a  as demonstrated in our previous work this structural optimization could benefit the docking result ai et al 2016  next we mutated cys145 to gly as required by the scar protocol to prepare the docking target ai et al 2016  the in-trials dataset 10083 compoundsconformations obtained from zinc15 was filtered by the generally used warhead groups targeting cysteine 5010 compoundsconformations before it was used in the docking process represented as scar-dock among which 1253 were left for manual checking after score filtering -80 as listed in table 1  we identified 11 potential covalent inhibitors of the 3clpro of sars-cov-2 following the scar protocol described previously ai et al 2016  these hits contain five different covalent warhead groups suitable for targeting cysteine which represents diverse structural options as shown in figure 1b  the putative covalent poses of the identified hits fit in the binding pocket reasonably in each drug the distance between the putative nucleophilic atom and the sg atom of cys145 is shown in table 1  in 6lu7 pdb id the distance between the covalent carbon atom of the inhibitor and the sg atom of cys145 is 18  therefore the proximity between these two atoms indicates high potential for covalent bonding between the drug and cys145 to investigate how the scar strategy helped enriching these hits we re-docked these compounds to the sars-cov-2 3clpro without mutating cys145 represented as regular-dock for quantitative comparison we took the lowest score of each compound in the regulardock results then we compared the difference between this lowest score with the score of the same compound in the scar-dock results represented as scar enriching score a note is that we used the score of the pose oriented for covalent bonding in scar-dock which is the lowest score only if the rank of the conformation is 1  table 1  as shown in table 1  for 6 out of these 11 compounds 545 the scardock protocol generated lower scores higher affinities corresponding to positive scar enriching scores this result might indicate that the scar protocol can generate better binding poses than the regular docking protocol if the compounds can covalently bind to cys145 although experimental validations will be necessary base on the parameters in table 1  we suggest the following ones might have higher priorities telcagepant vidupiprant poziotinib and fostamatinib in summary we have identified eleven approved or investigational drugs that might be repurposed to covalently inhibit the 3clpro of sars-cov-2 according to our previous studies the hits from the scar protocol could have different reactive bonding activities one reason is that the scar protocol does not consider the reactive activity of the warhead in a compound the other reason is that the reactive activity of a warhead is affected by the attached scaffold and the prediction of a warheads reactive activity is still a profoundly challenging issue considering the worldwide health risk posed by sars-cov-2 although wet experiments are needed to validate our computational hits we hope our work will provide more options for the rapid identification of targeted drugs to inhibit sars-cov-2 and save covid-19 patients in time  host transcriptome-guided drug repurposing for covid-19 treatment a meta-analysis based approach tamizhini loganathan srimathy ramachandran prakash shankaran devipriya nagarajan suma mohan s david tollervey   covid-19 is a pulmonary syndrome caused by a novel strain of coronavirus and according to the world health organization report as on 13th april 2020 1773084 people have been infected with about 111650 deaths globally coronavirus disease 2019 the primary mode of sars cov-2 transmission is through respiratory droplets generated during coughing and sneezing by infected patients huang et al 2020 symptoms include dry cough fatigue myalgia fever and dyspnea however the disease progresses to severe illness and leads to death in 6 of confirmed cases due to massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure rothe et al 2020 coronaviruses possess the largest genomes 264317 kb of all rna viruses encoding four main structural proteins contain spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins after the virus enters the host cell the genome is transcribed and then translated cascella et al 2020 invading respiratory viruses would either suppress or evade the innate immune and adaptive responses on the hosts side and increase virulence which leads to disease outcome with its limited genome size the virus extensively utilizes the host factors for their replication via inducing alterations in the host gene expression resulting in modulated immune response de wilde et al 2018 therefore the transcriptome analysis of host cell upon virus infection is useful for identifying host immune response dynamics and also significant host factors that would facilitate virus infection to develop effective therapeutic strategies it is necessary to understand the expression of host factors upon sars-cov-2 infection according to the current treatment scenario drug repurposing from fda approved drugs would be an effective alternative method that would improve the host factor against sars-cov-2 virus infection the transcriptome guided drug repurposing approaches utilize the drug perturbed expression profiles to identify potential drug candidates which show anti-correlation with the disease signature arakelyan et al 2019 in the present study initially we attempted to conduct the transcriptome analyses by utilizing the publicly available host transcriptome profiles against sars-cov-2 and also other respiratory virus infections that could provide information on altered host factors upon infection next based on the identified sars-cov-2 induced pro-viral host factors drug repurposing analyses were performed to identify the possible drugs for the treatment of the pandemic infection caused by covid-19 which would help to decrease the mortality of covid-19 patients globally gene expression profile datasets based on expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing and microarray in response to different coronaviruses such as

sars-cov-2 specific analysis in different cell lines which indicate sars-cov-2 specific gene signatures in a 24 h host infection models the venn diagram reports 32 genes common between a549 and nhbe cells highlighted in table s3 among that 31 genes noticed to be upregulated in both nhbe and a549 cells the remaining one gene krt4 found to be down-regulated in a549 and upregulated in nhbe cells the 31 genes showing consistent upregulation tendency in sars-cov-2 infected nhbe and a549 cells were selected for further analysis table 1 among that 19 genes overlapping with the meta-analysis data fig

includes ifi6 ifit1 mx1 irf9 irf7 oas1 ifih1 ifi27 plscr1 oas2 ifitm1 cxcl2 ifi44 ptgs2 bcl2a1 cxcl3 xaf1 and edn1 the heat map of the thirty-one significant genes was reported in fig 2b and has shown the same tendency table 1 in the original analysis reported by blanco-melo et al 2020 though the statistical parameters found to vary the genes upregulated in sars-cov-2 mainly included interferon-inducible genes the genes mx1 mx dynamin-like gtpase 1 irf9 interferon regulatory factor 9 oas1 oas3 25-oligoadenylate synthetase and ifi27 interferon-alpha inducible protein 27 which showed consistently more than two-fold upregulation in sars-cov-2 infected a549 and nhbe cells table 1 among the 31 significantly upregulated genes eight genes were found to be pro-viral host factors required for efficient viral replication which included tymp ptgs2 c1s cfb ifi44 xaf1 cxcl2 and cxcl3 and were further considered for drug repurposing analysis the average expression level of the reported pro-viral factors in sars-cov-2 infected and mock-control conditions are shown in fig 2c the selected 31 genes reported in table 1 were subjected to protein level interaction and functional enrichment analysis using the web tool string the proteinprotein interaction network was constructed mainly considering interactions with high confidence score 09 a significant network with 94 edges was obtained with a ppi enrichment p-value  10e16 the fourteen nodes of the network formed a cluster with a dense overlap of 88 edges and those nodes included ifi6 ifi27 ifit1 ifit3 ifitm1 ifitm3 irf7 irf9 ifih1 samhd1 oas1 oas2 oas3 mx1 and xaf1 and were reported in fig 3a the node size in the network indicates the connectivity degree and the gene irf7 was found to have the highest degree of 14 the cluster forming genes are part of the interferon alphabeta signaling and importantly the pathway enrichment analysis based on the reactome pathway reports this signaling as the top enriched pathway with a significant fdr of 232e24 and enriched with 14 genes table 2 the other significant pathways are cytokine signaling in the immune system enriched with 16 genes the immune system pathway with 20 genes and the antiviral mechanism by ifn-stimulated gens with six enriched genes the top enriched pathways and biological processes were reported in table 2 the other relevant pathways from kegg and reactome enriched by the set of genes were reported in table s4 the gene ontology go enrichment analysis of the 31 genes was reported in table s4 the top five biological processes include defense response type i interferon signaling pathway innate immune response response to the virus and response to other organisms the enriched molecular functions are 25-oligoadenylate synthetase activity and double-stranded rna binding table s4 to find potential drug molecules for repurposing against sars-cov-2 infection we have done the drugbank search with the 31 upregulated genes drug groups with approved or experimental status were considered for the analysis and the identified drug molecules for the target genes were tabulated in table 3 approved or experimental drugs were identified as modulators of the protein product of three genes cfb ass1 ifngr1 and ptgs2 the pharmacological action unknown for drugs targeting cfb and ass1 and a protein binder reported for ifngr1 importantly ptgs2 is a pro-viral factor and 76 approved drug molecules identified as inhibitorantagonist of ptgs2 protein table 3
 next we have utilized a gene expression signature-based drug repurposing strategy based on cmap connectivity map using the web tool clue a gene set can be queried to drug perturbation signatures to identify and rank drugs according to the similarity in gene expression a positive score indicates the similarity and negative score indicate the reverse effect of the drug signatures with the queried genes and its magnitude contributes to the magnitude of similarity among the 28 significantly upregulated genes eight genes were found to be pro-viral factors that are important for the viral infection and need to be targeted for the therapy point of view along with the eight genes nfkb1 and tlr2 also found to be pro-viral and upregulated in sars-cov-2 infected nhbe cells therefore the ten upregulated genes tymp ptgs2 c1s cfb ifi44 xaf1 cxcl2 cxcl3 nfkb1 and tlr2 were subjected to connectivity map-based gene expression signature search to find therapeutic compounds we could identify compounds with significantly correlated and anti-correlated signatures with that of the ten pro-viral host factors considered for the analysis the top-scored compounds with cmap connectivity score tau score 99 with the highest anti-correlation with the upregulated ten pro-viral genes are reported in table 4 there were 27 compounds with significant anti-correlation and the heat map obtained from clue analysis shown in fig 3b table 4 the approved drugs among those include estrone estrogen receptor agonist hexylresorcinol polyphenol oxidase inhibitor pentobarbital gaba receptor modulator nitrendipine calcium channel blocker phenazopyridine targeting scn1a heraclenol cobamamide alprazolam benzodiazepine receptor agonist bromocriptine dopamine receptor agonist and wt-171 vorinostat hdac inhibitor twelve of the 27 top drugs found to have reported anti-viral activity against different viruses which includes ritanserin jak3-inhibitor-i brd-k72541103 tipifarnib w-12 topoisomerase inhibitor brd-k52640952 hexylresorcinol ly-303511 sb-239063 sd-169 alprazolam dilazep danoprevir and are highlighted in table 4 and the structure of the drug molecules are shown in fig 4a next we analyzed the potential impact of the reported 27 drugs on the natural defense against infection for that we have checked the correlation between drug-perturbed expression profile with the 23 anti-viral proteins reported from the study using the connectivity map among the 27 drugs obtained based on pro-viral factors seven drugs tipifarnib dilazep gw-843682x estrone myricetin guggulsterone bromocriptine reported having mean connectivity score 90 and can down-regulate the anti-viral proteins therefore the above mentioned seven drugs can impact the host natural defense against viral infection and therefore caution needs to be taken we also checked the connectivity score of the ptgs2 inhibitors obtained from drugbank table 3 among the 76 drugs targeting ptgs2 six of them noticed to have a high negative tau score tau score 75 which indicates the possibility of reducing the expression of pro-viral factors table 3those drugs include lenalidomide anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib anti-inflammatory drug tenoxicam anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties meclofenamic acid anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties sulfasalazine anti-inflammatory drug loxoprofennon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug fig 4b the anti-inflammatory drugs which target ptgs2 mefenamic acid tolmetin ibuprofen and dexketoprofen the generic medication drug triamcinolonegeneric medication and the anti-cancer drug etoposide found to report high positive tau score which indicates a high correlation with the expression level of pro-viral host factors noticed in the sars-cov-2 infection and the possibility of promoting the viral infection by the medication based on the current analysis the potential ptgs2 inhibitors considered for drug repurposing against sars-cov-2 are reported in fig 4b a meta-analysis on publicly available gene expression profiles was adopted to identify respiratory virus infection mediated host response we could identify common host genes in 24-h infection models of different respiratory infection viruses and sars-cov-2 a set of differentially expressed 31 genes showing consistent expression pattern in sars-cov-2 infected conditions in nhbe and a549 cells were identified apart from mouse epithelial cell lines nhbe and a549 are the commonly used human lung epithelial-derived cell lines to study the sars coronaviruses both classical and cov-2 infection though a549 cells are susceptible to sars-cov infection owing to the low expression level of the ace2 receptor this cell line is not highly permissive for sars-cov-2 and the infection rate is low harcourt et al 2020 but a549 cells supplemented with a vector expressing ace2 enabled sars-cov-2 to replicate even in low infection conditions blanco-melo et al 2020 based on the updates in the geo dataset gse147507 the upregulated host factors common in both a549 cells expressing exogenous ace2 receptor and calu-3 cell lines in addition to nhbe cells are analyzed and there are nine common genes noticed which includes cxcl3 ass1 ube2l6 irf7 c1s serpina3 irf9 ifi6 and cfb the present study is based on a limited number of datasets on sars-cov-2 and possible to have more candidate genes with more samples with increased sequencing depth however the study tried to pick the robust set of genes with consistent expression patterns in two different cell types the pathway enrichment analysis highlights the interferon alphabeta signaling pathway cytokine signaling and immune system as the enriched pathways and defense and immune response associated process as the enriched biological processes which is consistent with the host response observed in various virus-infected conditions during the initial stage of virus infection the innate immune system will be stimulated to establish the first line of defense interferons ifn are a multigene family of inducible cytokines plays a critical role in initiating host antiviral responses boasso 2013 and are commonly grouped as type i which includes ifn- leukocyte ifn- fibroblast and ifn- while type ii ifn is also known as immune ifn ifn- schlaepfer et al 2019 in most mild cases type i ifn is highly effective at inhibiting viral replication during early short periods of viremia however in severe forms of viral replication the ability of type i ifn to inhibit viral replication is overwhelmed long et al 2009 studies showed that in balbc mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars there was a delay in type i inf response leading to enhanced viral replication resulting in elevated lung cytokinechemokine levels vascular leakage and impaired virus-specific t cell responses channappanavar et al 2016 ifn induces immune responses by activating the jakstat pathway which in turn forms a complex with interferon regulatory factor irf and migrates to the nucleus in order to stimulate the expressions of over 300 ifn-stimulated genes isgs that is necessary to inhibit viral replication teijaro 2016 among all isgs our analysis showed that ifn--inducible protein 6 ifi6 and ifn--inducible protein 27 were elevated in response to viral infection among the irf family members particularly irf-1 irf-3 and irf-7 are necessary for the production of type i ifn and also ifn-inducible genes bego mercier  cohen 2012 in our analyses we also observed that there was an increase in irf7 log2fc217 and irf9 log2fc  180 during sars-cov-2 infection and also in other respiratory virus infection altogether an increase in the level of ifn irfs and isgs plays a central role in antiviral responses which might be during an early stage of infection and we suggest that it could be used as a diagnostic marker upon virus infection like sars-cov-2 moreover in another study it has been shown that the multiplication of sars-cov in cell culture can be strongly inhibited by pretreatment with interferon-beta spiegel et al 2004 so we could suggest that treatment with interferon mimics immediately after infection might stimulate the jakstat pathway which in turn stimulates isgs and ultimately enhance antiviral effects interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins ifitms are identified as a key isgs induced by interferon and interfere with virus entry ifitms ifitm1237 are induced by ifn and are necessary for innate immunity chen et al 2019 ifitm2 and ifitm3 might reduce the infectivity of viruses by regulating virus-endosome fusion rates and accelerating the trafficking of virus-endosome to lysosomes spence et al 2019 similar to ifitm 25-oligoadenylate synthetases oas1 oas2 oas3 are induced by type i ifn interferons and in the presence of viral dsrna oas catalyze oligomerisation of atp to form 25-linked adenosine oligomers 2-5a which would involve in the activation of rnase l degradative pathway that would cleave the viral rna and ultimately control viral infection kristiansen et al 2010 leisching et al 2019 in our analyses we observed that there was up-regulation in ifitm 1 and 3 and oas 123 in virus-infected cells which could be due to the early stage of infection interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats ifits is strongly induced by ifn- are strong inducers whereas ifn- acts as a weak inducer fensterl  sen 2011 ifit3 is necessary for maintaining cell survival by decreasing the rate of apoptotic cell death the knockdown of ifit3 decreased the production of antiviral cytokine ifn- hsu et al 2013 our observation showed that there was an increased expression of ifit 1 and 3 in virus-infected cells additionally there was a significant increase in the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 related protein a which might involve in protecting cell death against viral infection interferon-induced with helicase c domain 1 ifih1 gene belonging to helicase family and encodes a cytoplasmic receptor critical for viral rna sensing during viral entry ifih interacts with viral rna and leads to polymerization of ifih1 molecules into a filament which assembly assemble further to initiate signaling cascade to induce type 1 ifn production and leads to activation of antiviral genes asgari et al 2017 the lsam and hd domain-containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase1 samhd1 protein binds to viral rna and exhibits exonuclease activity on single-stranded nucleic acids studies showed that the degradation of samhd1 might enhance the replication of herpes viruses in co-infected patients kim et al 2013 mx dynamin-like gtpase 1 protein recognize and binds to the nucleocapsids of invading viruses and prevents the intracellular transport of the nucleocapsids into the cell nucleus which ultimately leads to an early block of the viral transcription and replication patzina haller  kochs 2014 in our analyses there was an increase in ifih1 samhd1 mx1during viral infection which might be due to the early stage of infection e3 ubiquitin ligase deltex 3l is another protein induced by interferon and it forms complex with poly adp-ribose polymerase parp9 and targets both host histone h2bj to promote isg expression and also viral 3c protease to disrupt viral assembly in both nucleus and cytoplasm zhang et al 2015 phospholipid scramblase plscr1a multiply palmitoylated and lipid-raft-associated endofacial plasma membrane protein are induced by inf upon induction newly synthesized plscr1 is not palmitoylated and so it easily enters into nuclei via importin  nucleopore transport where it binds to dna and induces the expression of certain critical antiviral genes including isg15 isg54 p56 and guanylate binding proteins wiedmer et al 2003 dong et al 2004 serine protease inhibitors serpins being elements of the innate immune system and belong to the largest and most diverse family of protease inhibitors serpins reportedly interfere with viral replication at both the entry and the reverse transcription stages asmal et al 2012 the gene serpine encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor pai and has been reported that pai-2 expression significantly reduced the surface expression of the virus receptor molecules daf car and icam-1 and thereby inhibits the binding of virus and exhibits antiviral effect congote 2006 in our study we observed that there was an increase in the level of serpine in virus-infected cells argininosuccinate synthase ass catalyzes the reversible atp-dependent ligation of citrulline and aspartate to generate argininosuccinate importantly ass physically interacts with bacterial lipopolysaccharides and lipid a and inactivates their biological activities satoh et al 2006 however much detailed mechanism was not investigated and in our study along with ass1 there was an increased in e3 ubiquitin ligase deltex 3l plscr1 and serpin were increased which might be one of the antiviral effects induced by the host cell during the early stage of viral infection besides antiviral proteins in the host system a few pro-viral proteins were consistently increased at the mrna level involved in virus-mediated infection and they include tp cox-2 complement 1s and factor b ifi44 xaf4 cxcl3 thymidine phosphorylase tp is a potent angiogenic factor and a putative marker of cellular oxidative stress and is upregulated in patients of hbv and hcv infected liver tissue with an early event and it becomes more prominent as the disease progresses to cirrhosis however further research has not been carried out on tp during viral infection mimidis et al 2005 endothelin-1 et-1 has been shown to exhibit several physiologic functions including salt and water homeostasis vascular tone and inflammation increased cytokines production during viral infection would increase the levels of endothelin-1 in the cells bouallegue boudaou  srivastava 2007 upon stimulation et1 is reported to increase the production il-6 tnf-alpha icam vcam and e-selectin which would potentiate inflammation christ-crain schuetz  mller 2008 thus the use of endothelin blockers might effectively reduce the virus-induced lung inflammation prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 ptgs2 or cyclo-oxygenase2 cox-2 is an inducible pro-inflammatory enzyme the structural proteins from the sars-cov reported to induce the expression of cox-2 in vitro liu et al 2007 and there by increased expression of pgs in the blood of sars-cov-infected individuals lee et al 2004 additionally the activity of cox might be required for efficient entry and also for an initial step in rna replication and they suggested that this could be targeted for anti-cov therapy raaben et al 2007 cox-2 also reported to play a crucial role in limiting the anti-viral cytokineinterferon response to viral infection and thereby thus use of effective cox-2 selective inhibitor during early viral infection may enhance andor prolong endogenous interferon responses and thereby might increase anti-viral immunity kirkby et al 2013 in our analyses we observed that cox-2 expression was increased in virus-infected cells the complement is an important element of innate immunity that functions to recognize and eliminate invading microbes in our current study we observed that increased expression of classical pathway protein c1s and alternative pathway protein factor b during viral infection in a sars-cov-infected mice study it was reported that complement activation results in immune-mediated damage in the lung of c3 deficient mice which suggested that inhibition of the complement pathway might be an effective therapeutic strategy to inhibit coronavirus-mediated respiratory diseases gralinski et al 2018 chemokines being a family of small secretory proteins are expressed in constitutively or in an inducible manner the important role of chemokines is to attract leukocytes to sites of infectioninflammation and has been reported that chemokines cxcl2 and cxcl3 are increased in the herpes virus arenavirus and rhabdovirus melchjorsen srensen  paludan 2003 and thus targeting cxcl23 could be an effective therapeutic target during viral infection ifi44 is a cytoplasmic protein and a type i ifn-induced protein and is upregulated upon a variety of virus infections generally isgs display antiviral functions however ifi44 has been reported to negatively modulate antiviral responses induced by multiple viral systems ifi44 by inhibiting activates nf-b which migrates to the nucleus and activates pro-inflammatory cytokines dediego et al 2014 ifi44 is responsible for the pathogenesis of some viruses including coronaviruses dediego et al 2019 xaf1 is an apoptosis-promoting factor by binding to xiap which involves in caspase suppression and inhibits cell death it has been reported that xaf1 promotes apoptosis in denv2-infected huvecs by binding to xiap and also collaborates with tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand trail-induced cell death leaman et al 2002 in our analysis we have observed that xaf1 and ifi44 protein in virus-infected cells which could be targeted against viral infection at present the drug-repurposing approaches on sars-cov-2 based on different host factor is being carried out zhou et al 2020 ge et al 2020 we have used host transcriptome based pro-viral factors for the drug repurposing against sars-cov-2 early infection conditions among the 31 up-regulated genes the pro-viral host factors in sars-cov-2 infection were identified by literature-survey which includes tymp ptgs2 c1s cfb ifi44 xaf1 cxcl2 and cxcl3 the genes tymp c1s and cfb were found to be unique in sars-cov-2 infection the other genes ptgs2 ifi44 xaf1 cxcl2 and cxcl3 reports the up-regulation tendency in the other respiratory virus infections as well when considering the pro-viral factors identified from the study for the therapeutic strategies against sars-cov-2 drugs targeting ptgs2 are found to be of potential use and are obtained from the drugbank search we could notice that six anti-inflammatory drugs targeting ptgs2 lenalidomide celecoxib tenoxicam meclofenamic acid sulfasalazine and loxoprofen can induce anti-correlated expression signature with the pro-viral factors and can be considered for the therapeutic purpose of sars-cov-2 infection importantly the ptgs2 inhibiting drugs celecoxib and loxoprofen already reported to be useful for the treatment of viral infection the drug celecoxib was shown to decrease inflammatory gene expression in the context of tc-83 virus infection risner et al 2019 the drug loxoprofen found to be useful for patients with acute upper respiratory tract infection including those with influenza infection azuma et al 2011 importantly the ptgs2 inhibitors reported in the study indomethacin naproxen ibuprofen and thalidomide are currently under the clinical trials for treating covid-19 the approved drug molecules obtained from cmap analysis are from different therapy area including the menopausal hormone therapy estrone antiseptic hexylresorcinol anti-anxiety agent pentobarbital antihypertensive agent nitrendipine analgesic phenazopyridine neurological heraclenol anxiety disorder alprazolam dopaminergic activity bromocriptine and anticoagulant activity wt-171 vorinostat however anti-anxiety agent pentobarbital is reported to have various adverse effects hepatotoxicity laryngospasam anemia bradycardia and respiratory depression aboukhaled  hirsch 2008 anti-viral activity has been reported for many of the experimental or investigational compounds identified from our study the study by nukuzuma et al 2009 reports that the 5ht2ar antagonist ritanserin have an inhibitory effect on human polyomavirus jcv infection and reproduction jak3 inhibition is another anti-viral strategy that is found to block multiple cytokines and protect against a super inflammatory response xu et al 2012 tipifarnib may inhibit the prenylation step of the hepatitis delta virus hdv replication lempp  urban 2017 anti-viral effect against species associated with upper respiratory tract infection urtis or known to cause acute sore throat observed with the drug hexylresorcinol shephard  zybeshari 2015 alprazolam and dilazep found to be effective in influenza virus infection and hiv respectively and danaprevir is a hepatitis c virus protease inhibitor freire-garabal et al 1993 zeng et al 2014 gane et al 2014 apart from that the calmodulin antagonist and topoisomerase i inhibitor have reported antiviral activity against the dengue virus and hiv infection bautista-carbajal 2017 showalter  blair 2016 therapeutically targeting the kinases such as pi3k and p38 kinase found to be useful in viral infection wu et al 2015 griego et al 2000 the proposed compounds from the study can be considered for the validation experiments in summary we have used publicly available human host gene expression profiles in early infection conditions of sars-cov-2 and other respiratory infection viruses and identified the important host factors in sars-cov-2 infection considering the consistent expression signature and literature evidence we could identify 31 upregulated host factors and out of them eight are pro-viral factors in sars-cov-2 infection the study is an effort to identify repurposed drugs for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection considering the pro-viral host factors the connectivity map based repurposing proposed twelve compounds with evident antiviral activity from the literature survey apart from that we could propose that inhibition of ptgs2 can be a potential therapeutic strategy for viral infection and the proposed six approved ptgs2 inhibitor drugs can be repurposed for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection the study is based on the presently available dataset in public domain databases and may fluctuate based on the sample selection in the analysis therefore we have considered strict criteria of consistency in expression patterns and evidence from the literature in the selection of host factors for repurposing studies the rapid therapeutic recommendations from this computational approach can be repeated as more rna-seq datasets become available and could be done on protein-level and need to be validated by wet-lab experiments and clinical trials  molecular docking and binding mode analysis of selected fda approved drugs against covid-19 selected key protein targets an effort towards drug repurposing to identify the combination therapy to combat covid-19 atanu barik geeta rai gyan modi  the emergence of covid-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral and antibiotic drugs drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure rate high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of new molecules into the clinical candidate on the other side drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses is an attractive alternative approach for a new application of marketed fda approved or investigational drugs in the current pandemic situation raised due to covid-19 repurposing of existing fda approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment the causative viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov shares high nucleotide similarity therefore many existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to sars-cov and likely to be inhibited by the same compounds here we selected three viral key proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle ace2 helps in entry into the human host viral nonstructural proteins rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp12 and nsp16 which helps in replication and viral latency invasion from immunity the fda approved drugs chloroquine cq hydroxychloroquine hcq remdesivir rdv and arbidol abd are emerging as promising agents to combat covid-19 our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the binding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues playing a key role in their mechanism of action the docking studies were carried out through autodock and online covid-19 docking server further studies on a broad range of fda approved drugs including few more protein targets molecular dynamics studies invitro and in-vivo biological evaluation are required to identify the combination therapy targeting various stages of the viral life cycle  the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak could force to impose major changes to health system across the globe and possible bring a major challenges to human being for the survival followed struggling to keep the global economy on correct pace if the spread of the virus is not eff ectively controlled 5 6 the causative agent of this devastating disease covid-19 belongs to beta coronavirus which shares 891 nucleotide similarity with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 7 the key amino acid residues are conserved in many viral key drug targets including those found in both sars-cov and covid-19 pathogens consequently many common viral targets are structurally similar to sars-cov and likely to be inhibited by the same compounds the emergence of covid-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral and antibiotic drugs new compounds and targets are needed to meet the growing threat from beta coronavirus the possibility that covid-19 and other virusesbacteria can be perniciously engineered as biowarfare agents creates another demand for new treatment options drug discovery is a multistep process with a high attrition rate substantial cost and slow pace of development of new molecules into the clinical candidate on the other side drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses is an attractive alternative approach for the new application of fda approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical condition 8 there is a plethora of literature evidence indicated the vital application of drug repurposing for various infectious diseases 9 10 11 given the current scenario of covid-19 outbreak across the world and the complex nature of the disease repurposing of existing fda approved drugs is the first line of the treatment given the pandemic nature of the disease there is a hard-pressing need to uncover the possible treatments as early as possible the researchers and physicians have been putting sincere efforts to understand this new virus the pathophysiology of the disease to and the possible therapeutic effective agents and vaccines tremendous effects have been done to study the newly emerged virus and find potent drugs for clinical usage a pubmed search with key work covid-19 resulted in more than 900 publications from november 01 2019 to april 31 2020 a glance at the title of these papers indicated that the majority are focused on manifestations and treatment options it has been shown in the literature that the fda approved antimalarial and autoimmune disease drug chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq known to inhibit viral infection by raising endosomal ph necessary for the interaction of viruscell fusion 12 13 14 cq and hcq interferes ace2 glycosylation or glycosyltransferases within human cells or inhibits sialic acid biosynthesis by inhibiting quinone reductase 2 the immunomodulatory property of chloroquine synergistically involved with the anti-viral property the antiviral drug remdesivir rdv can inhibit the growth of covid-19 and found to be efficacious in the clinic in combination 13 15 16 17the mechanism of action of rdv is under investigation however the high sequence similarity 95 between covid-19 and sars-cov rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp indicating the inhibition of rdrp similarly the broad-spectrum virus-host cell fusion inhibitor marketed antiviral drug arbidol abd prevents the entry of the virus entry into the host cell acting through ace2 has entered into a clinical trial for the treatment of covid-19 18 19 inspired from the current pandemic situation and our experience in drug repurposingdrug design through computational and medicinal chemistry tools we have carried docking studies with selected fda approved drugs against covid-19 selected key protein targets given the complex nature of this rapidly and severely infecting lower respiratory system disease our hypothesis is to identify fda approved drug combinations targeting the different key viral proteins  the selection of the key   proteins is based on the virus life cycle starting from attachment onto the human host replication viral latency invasion from immunity release and complex nature of the disease the selection of four key targets pdb id 6lzg which is the structure of novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with its receptor ace2 pdb id 6nur a recently identified sars-coronavirus nsp12 bound to nsp7 and further to expand the specificity we performed online docking by using the covid- we will further improve our next publications table 6  the receptor pocket and top 10 conformers are shown in figure 6 a a b  figure 8b  the negative free energy calculation -631 kcalmole as shown in table   5 is an indication of the interaction of abd with nonstructural viral proteins our docking studies of abd with nsp16-nsp10 however our docking methodology did not work very well with this target resulted in the high positive values of binding energy data are not shown here we will further improve our next publications a here we report the preliminary docking studies of the selected fda approved drugs which have shown promising anti-covid-19 activity literature evidences are indicating a single drug is probably not effective for the treatment of this disease the viral polymerases and proteases are known to be the most suitable targets for the treatment of viral born disease therefore we selected the targets to cover a range of targets starting from the entry point to the multiplication and release of the viruses in   drug targets for covid-19 therapeutics ongoing global efforts ambrish saxena   sars-cov-2 is a member of the coronaviruses cov class of viruses cov are essentially positive-stranded rna viruses and display a crown-like appearance on the surface when observed under an electron microscope it is due to the presence of this crown-like structure that this class of viruses is called coronaviruses coronam being the latin term for crown alanagreh et al2020 rehman et al2020 structurally these crown-like structures are glycoprotein present on the viral envelope which facilitate virus entry in the host cells coutard et al2020 there are four known subfamilies of coronaviruses classified as alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavorus and deltacoronavirus li et al2020a although the zoological evolution of coronaviruses is still an active research subject it is widely accepted that alpha- and betacoronaviruses are predominant in bats and rodents whereas delta- and gammacoronavirus gene sources are the avian species brussow 2020a cascella et al2020 coronaviridae study group of the international committee on taxonomy of 2020 the causative virus of covid-19 pandemic sars-cov-2 virus is a part betacoronavirus subfamily and is believed to have crossed the species barrier to infect humans due to zoonotic transmission mackenzie and smith 2020 zimmermann and curtis 2020 the hallmark of coronavirus transcription is the production of multiple sub-genomic rnas containing sequences corresponding to both genomic ends song et al2020 these viruses utilize rna-dependent rna synthesis to generate mrnas transcribed by the host genome genetically sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus with a genome size of 30 kb which encodes for two open reading frames orfs ceraolo and giorgi 2020 dabravolski and kavalionak 2020 yang et al2005 these orfs are designated as 1a and 1b and code for protease 3clpro and plpro these proteases then cleave the polypeptide into 16 non-structural proteins nsp which are essentially viral enzymes involved in replication and packaging of the virus within the host cell and four structural proteins that contribute to the outer structure of the virus jean et al2020 mckee et al2020 van boheemen et al2012 like other coronaviruses the outer surface of the sars-cov-2 virus is made of spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and the nucleocapsid n protein the m and e proteins are involved in virus morphogenesis and assembly the spike protein s is at the forefront of infection and interacts with the ace-2 receptor on the host cell surface thereby promoting virus-cell membrane fusion during initiation of viral infection the envelope e and membrane m protein constitute the cover outside the viral genetic material inside the shell of m and e proteins is the rna which is guarded by the nucleocapsid protein glebov 2020 nieto-torres et al2011 nieto-torres et al2015 it is a well-accepted fact that the sars-cov-2 transmission is facilitated by respiratory secretions in the form of dropletaerosol when a person comes in close contact with the infected person guo et al2020a b recent reports suggest that the infection can also spread through stool urine and respiratory secretions casanova et al2010 ding et al2020 wang et al2020b as soon as the sars-cov-2 virus enters the human body it establishes a cycle of replication by binding to cell types such as enterocytes and pneumocytes this virus can also infect tubular renal epithelial cells bao et al2020 immune cells annweiler et al2020 and cerebral neurons bilinska et al2020 xie and chen 2020b the spike protein present on the surface of sars-cov-2 is responsible for the primary establishment of host-protein interaction the spike protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 receptor present on the host cell plasma membrane annweiler et al2020 hasan et al2020b post receptor recognition the viral genome including the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell as shown in figure 1 as mentioned above the sars-cov-2 viral genome has two orfs 1a and 1b these orfs translate to two polypeptides pp pp1a and pp1b which in turn hijack the host cellular ribosomes for their own translational process thereby making a replication-transcription complex bojkova et al2020 dong et al2020 the polypeptide is processed by proteases and this processing results in 16 non-structural proteins nsps and each of these has its own specific function in replication and transcription hillen et al2020 te velthuis et al2012 nsp1 and 2 are involved in the suppression of host gene expression nsp5 is involved in replication whereas nsp4 and 6 are transmembrane proteins kandeel et al2020 stobart et al2013 zhang et al2020b nsp7 and 8 act as primases while nsp9 is an rna-binding protein the dimeric form of nsp9 is critical for viral infection and disruption of this dimerization could be a potential strategy to inhibit the infection nsp10 is involved in replication and nsp12 is an rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 has helicase activity nsp14 demonstrates exonuclease activity and nsp15 has endoribonuclease activity while nsp16 possesses methyltransferase activity athmer et al2017 hillen et al2020 hu et al2009 jia et al2019 mirza and froeyen 2020 neogi et al2020 these nsps with the help of host machinery translate the rna coding for the viral spike envelope nucleocapsid and membrane proteins these proteins then enter the endoplasmic reticulum er  golgi apparatus and are involved in viral assembly and packaging the viral genome binds to the nucleocapsid n protein and results in the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex rnp cong et al2017 gui et al2017 narayanan et al2008 narayanan et al2015 as depicted in figure 1 coronaviruses exploit the hosts endosomal pathway to gain entry in the host cell as such the virus entry into the host cell is an energetically unfavorable process brielle et al2020 but viruses are able to overcome this barrier due to the low ph environment and ph-dependent endosomal cysteine protease du et al2020 simmons et al2011 zhang et al2019 other host proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 and tmprss11d also known as airway trypsin-like protease are involved in the processing of the spike protein into its constituent subunits s1 and s2 and promote virus entry at the plasma membrane of the host iwata-yoshikawa et al2019 maggio and corsini 2020 matsuyama et al2010 agents that modify the ph or inhibit these proteases can be potential drug targets for anti-coronavirus therapy baglivo et al2020 bein et al2020 finally the virus particle is assembled and it again exploits the hosts exosomal pathway and fuses with the plasma membrane resulting in the release of virus particles into the extracellular region upon infection the viral load increases in the host body and this results in an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines alosaimi et al2020 conti et al2020 magro 2020 and chemokines alosaimi et al2020 channappanavar and perlman 2017 gralinski et al2018 skinner et al2019 which have the potential to damage the lung tissuetanaka et al2013 leading to deterioration of lung function and finally lung failure brussow 2020b the first approach is to check existing antiviral compounds and molecules and estimate their effect on viral replication and packaging molecules like interferon alpha beta and gamma ribavirin and chemical inhibitors of cyclophilin 8 ma-lauer et al2020 zhang et al2020a can be evaluated for their antiviral activities these known antivirals have a strategic advantage since they are in active clinical use and their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are well studied on the flip side such drugs might lack specificity against sars-cov-2 and thus may have severe adverse effects ahn et al2020 busquet et al2020 the second approach involves screening of chemical libraries that constitute compounds targeting transcriptional machinery of various cell lines high-throughput screening technology has the potential to screen large libraries of drug-likely chemical compounds for chemical entities having antiviral effects even libraries of existing drugs can be screened to support drug repurposing efforts thereby leading to the identification of new functions of many known drug molecules berdigaliyev and aljofan 2020 de wilde et al2014 dyall et al2014 kindrachuk et al2015 lu et al2014 marketed drugs like lopinavirritonavir which was earlier intended to be used in anti-hiv therapy and was subsequently used to treat sars have emerged as a result of the successful execution of such screening programs chu et al2004 cvetkovic and goa 2003 however a serious disadvantage of this approach is that the hits obtained from such screenings may have immunosuppressive or cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations another disadvantage is that the half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of drugs required to be effective against the sars-cov-2 infection might exceed the highest serum concentration cmax levels that can be achieved by pharmacological dosing mirza and froeyen 2020 the third approach could involve the development of specific novel agents resulting from strong basic research around the genomic and biophysical understanding of the sars-cov-2 life cycle sirna molecules or inhibitors that have the capability to inhibit specific viral enzymes involved in viral replication cycle or monoclonal antibodies targeting the host receptor ace-2 could be the result of such an endeavor hasan et al2020b such an approach has the potential to return a large number of virus-specific promising therapies against the sars-cov-2 virus one of the major hurdles in such therapies is the specific drug delivery of these molecules and a lack of understanding of sirna-based therapy lesch et al2019 sohrab et al2018 every drug or investigational drug candidate possesses some unique characteristics or signature like its transcriptomic effect profile structural or adverse effect profile and by matching these characteristicssignatures with another disease or drug repurposing can be achieved karaman and sippl 2019 koudijs et al2019 using this approach for drug repurposing researchers rely on either drugdisease comparison or drugdrug comparison in the first case signatures of a particular drugs gene expression profile before and after treatment is compared with the differential gene expression profile obtained similarly by comparing profiles of healthy with the diseased jhamb et al2019 khosravi et al2019 one such drug repurposing example that has taken this approach is the topiramate which is normally used as an antiepileptic drug and acts as an agonist for gamma amino butyric acid gaba activity dudley 2011 dudley et al2011 based on studies by dudley and co-workers using the drug-disease approach it was established that topiramate can also be used for inflammatory bowel disease ibd as it had signatures comparable to prednisolone the treatment of choice for ibd dudley 2011 the drugdrug similarity approach identifies a common mechanism of action for drugs that belong to different classes and are usually structurally dissimilar bakal et al2019 wu et al2019 yang et al2019 computational molecular docking is an indispensable tool for drug repurposing activities chen et al2012 cicaloni et al2019 here by using structure-based computational strategy binding efficiency is predicted between the drug and the target molecule elfiky 2020 with this method large- and small-scale screens can be conducted with known drugs against a disease target brindha et al2016 kitchen et al2004 however this technique has its own limitations such as for many targets 3d structure is not elucidated or there is a lack of available screen-able macromolecular database that can provide structural information for a varied molecular class of drug xia 2017 zhou et al2019 molecular pathway or network mapping is one of the most commonly used methods for drug repurposing many identified drug targets are not directly druggable as their direct inhibition might lead to severe adverse effects and thus network mapping can inform about the upstream or downstream druggable targets thereby enabling drug repurposing oulas et al2019 zhou et al2020b based on gene expression pattern and disease pathology drug and disease networks can be created using network mapping tools gns et al2019 janardhan et al2018 such maps and networks can open enormous possibilities for drug repurposing advances in information technology with artificial intelligence ai and big-data analysis are revolutionizing drug repurposing efforts and studies mucke 2018 with the help of machine learning tools computational algorithms can be developed that can predict new drug target engagement with far greater accuracy than earlier used methods alvarez-machancoses et al2020 kuang et al2019 luscher dias et al2020 nabirotchkin et al2020 huge data generated by high-throughput next gen sequencing ngs from numerous patients when combined with disease characteristics and treatment options can lead to the identification of new disease biomarkers and drug targets stupnikov et al2018 zai et al2018 ai-driven supervised machine learning algorithms can implement multiomics and multitask learning to facilitate drug response elicited by engagement of multiple drug targets nascimento et al2019 nath et al2018 saberian et al2019 zhao and so 2019 the impact of this technology can be appreciated by evaluating a recent study where a computational methodology was developed that can utilize heterogeneous data from previously described drug target interactions to predict new interactions with even greater accuracy the methodology known as deepdtnet can integrate networks connecting multiple drugs with drug targets and disease database with the help of deep learning a form of machine learning based on ai brasil et al2019 monteiro et al2020 wen et al2017 zeng et al2020 the approaches for drug repurposing can also be utilized to scout for drugs that can be effective antivirals by screening the database of small molecules against viral drug targets using computational methods drugs or molecules can be identified may possess antiviral activity pizzorno et al2019 essentially three different scenarios can be discussed to facilitate antiviral drug repurposing 1 known targetnew virus in this scenario an established antiviral drug targeting a specific proteinpathway is found to possess antiviral activity against other viruses known viral rna polymerase favipiravir and sofosbuvir were initially developed for the treatment of influenza virus and hepatitis c virus hcv infection and were repurposed for treatment of ebola virus bai and hsu 2019 du et al2020 johansen et al2015 muthaiyan et al2020 salata et al2019 veljkovic et al2015 and zika virus infection abbasi 2016 bernatchez et al2020 montes-grajales et al2020 mumtaz et al2017 2 known targetnew indication in this scenario the pharmacological target is implicated to be affected in a new pathogenic infection in such cases drugs targeting these proteins can be repurposed as effective antiviral agents one such example is about the repurposing of anti-cancer agent imatinib cellular abelson abl kinase is the target of imatinib and the same was shown to be active against coronaviruses ananthula et al2018 coleman et al2016 giuliani et al2018 3 new targetnew indication this scenario occurs when an approved drug with a specific target is found to target additional viral proteins or targets many antimicrobial agents like teicoplanin aziz et al2018 zhou et al2016 ivermectin chaccour and rabinovich 2019 rabinovich 2018 itraconazole alhakamy and md 2019 pace et al2016 schloer et al2019 tsubamoto et al2017 and nitazoxanide cao et al2017 rossignol 2016 were also found to be active against some viral infections in the year 2003 the sars pandemic like covid-19 caught the world by surprise early days in the sars pandemic patients in hong kong and canada were treated with a combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids rainer 2004 tsang et al2003 however subsequent reports indicated towards ribavirins high rate of toxicity and lack of ability to control the infection spread booth and stewart 2005 sung et al2004 wong et al2003 use of corticosteroid methylprednisolone is controversial as far as sars was concerned in multiple cases dose-related toxicity was observed the lower dose of methylprednisolone 250500mgday demonstrated some improvement on a subset of critical sars patients however a prolonged usage in the absence of any specific antimicrobial agent predisposed the patients to disseminated fungal infection chan et al2003a b tsang and seto 2004 tsang and lam 2003 and avascular necrosis chan et al2003a b based on localized single-center uncontrolled clinical studies it was recommended that corticosteroids should only be used as a rescue therapy and not as a treatment as it might impair the host viral clearance sung et al2004 viral infections such as hepatitis b and c have been successfully treated by interferon treatment christian et al2004 since interferon is also broad-spectrum antiviral it was used in some single-center open-labelled uncontrolled clinical settings against sars in these small trials patients were stable post-treatment with interferon in combination with corticosteroids the results pointed out that perhaps with interferon treatment the lung deterioration can be delayed although this could not be proven statistically zhao et al2003 also post this treatment improved oxygen saturation levels and lower creatine phosphokinase levels were observed in critically ill patients however this warranted properly designed clinical trials globally loutfy et al2003 a combination of viral protease inhibitor ritonavir 400 mg and lopinavir 100 mg when administered orally with 12 h interval for 10 to 14 days as standard therapy yielded the most promising outcome in hong kongbased clinical studies chan et al2003a b here the subjects showed a reduction in steroid dependency and nosocomial infections at the same time reduction in viral load and concomitant increase in peripheral lymphocyte count was observed this combination appears to be promising and even for covid-19 as well this combination is being tested in clinical trials however some serious adverse effects were also reported from patients undergoing treatment for sars infection with this combination subjects were observed to suffer from pancreatitis diarrhea abdominal pain and liver dysfunction among other associated discomforts like abdominal pain asthenia headache nausea insomnia and skin rash chu et al2004 sars-cov-2 utilizes the spike protein present on the viral surface to gain entry into the host cells the proteinprotein interaction that takes place between the subunits of the spike protein and the active site of the ace-2 receptor can be targeted to identify an effective treatment strategy wrapp 2020 like other viruses the coronaviruses also outsmart drugs targeted against them by constantly mutating the active site of spike protein becerra-flores and cardozo 2020 chang et al2020 goo et al2020 qing et al2020 as a result the sars-cov-2 spike protein recognizes the ace-2 receptor more efficiently than the previously studied sars virus albini et al2020 chen et al2020 dediego et al2008 hasan et al2020a mathewson et al2008 specifically the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein is a critical target for antibody-mediated disruption of binding many antibodies demonstrating the ability to disrupt this binding are in preclinical stages of development chen et al2020 tai et al2020 tian et al2020 another strategy is to engage and overwhelm the ace-2 receptor with recombinant human ace-2 which is normally present on the cell surface so delivering an excess of the soluble ace2 helps to neutralize the virus by competitively binding to sars-cov-2 rhace2 gsk2586881 ameratunga et al2020 basit et al2020 an open-labeled randomized controlled pilot clinical trial is in progress to evaluate this approach nct04287686 apart from the ace-2 receptor cellular serine protease tmprss2 also plays an important role in facilitating the entry of the virus in host cells hoffmann 2020 a clinically proven chemical inhibitor of tmprss2 camostat mesylate is also able to significantly reduce infection in cell lines of human lung origin mckee et al2020 rahman et al2020 shirato et al2013 sternberg et al2020 in addition to this the heptad repeat 1 hr1 and heptad repeat 2 hr2 present on the sars-cov-2 have also been implicated in the facilitation of cell membrane fusion hr2derived peptides exhibit effective fusion inhibitory activity bosch et al2008 huang et al2019 wang et al2019 xia et al2019a xia et al2019b it is known that post fusion of the spike protein with ace-2 receptor the virus is ingested in the cells in a ph and receptor-dependent endocytosis chu et al2006 glebov 2020 targeting endocytosis can be another potential strategy towards developing potential drug candidates against sars-cov-2 clathrin-mediated endocytosis is regulated by ap-2- associated protein kinase 1 aak1 uitdehaag et al2019 based on library screening janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib was identified as a possible candidate drug for sars-cov-2 baglivo et al2020 cantini et al2020 lo caputo et al2020 also oubain another inhibitor of clathrin-mediated is being tested for its efficacy in drug trials for sars-cov-2 positive patients sisk et al2018 recently chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have garnered great interest as a therapy against sars-cov-2 infection alexander et al2020a alia and grant-kels 2020 arnold and buckner 2020 ballout et al2020 costanzo et al2020 several clinical trials are underway to assess the contribution of chloroquine therapy in inhibiting sars-c0v-2 viral progression keshtkar-jahromi and bavari 2020 also it was shown in vitro that a derivative of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine ec50  072m is far more potent in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection than chloroquine ec50  547 m savarino et al2003 yao et al2020 although the exact molecular mechanism of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 remains elusive it is believed that hydroxychloroquine may impair endosome-mediated viral entry or the late stages of viral replication devaux et al2020 as a result of aggressive antiviral drug development and discovery programs undertaken in the past multiple drugs have been developed against viral proteases polymerases and helicases martinez 2020b drugs developed against other viral diseases such as remdesivir wang 2020 flavipiravir li et al2020b lopinavirritonavir beck et al2020 costanzo et al2020 gyebi et al2020 schoergenhofer et al2020 are presently being evaluated in clinical trials for their efficacy in containing the covid-19 pandemic remdesivir an antiviral drug developed against ebola is an adenosine analog which inserts into viral rna chains by rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrps and results in premature transcription termination cao et al2020 gordon et al2020 similarly favipiravir and ribaviorin are guanine analogs and are approved for some viral diseases costanzo et al2020 fan et al2020 eidd-2801 is another oral antiviral drug that acts as a nucleotide analog like remdisivir albeit with lower ec50 and is orally administrable agostini et al2019 other antiviral compounds lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors that target 3clike protease 3clpro of sars-cov-2 bhatnagar et al2020 the main coronavirus protease 3clpro is responsible for processing the polypeptide to nsps using high-throughput screening for compounds against 3clpro four molecules viz prulifloxacin tegobuvir bictegravirand and nelfinavir were identified barnard et al2006 de clercq 2006 liu et al2020b sars-cov-2 envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n protein are critical for virus survival and propagation and therefore such structural proteins are the best drug targets since these viral proteins are structurally very different from the host proteins drug targeting these proteins will have minimal adverse effects apart from protecting the viral genome these structural proteins are also involved in suppressing the host immune system thereby providing the virus a strategic advantage over the host bojkova et al2020 borgio et al2020 cherian et al2020 the n protein acts to suppress rna silencing and suppresses rna interference-mediated by sirna therefore many sirna based therapeutics target viral e m and n protein translation and inhibit viral replication at least in vitro nur et al2015 sohrab et al2018 song et al2019 however sirna-based therapies are still not available for human use due to inherent stability issues and the unavailability of reliable delivery methods de clercq 2006 the e protein also serves as an ion channel and this action is inhibited by hexamethylene amiloride pervushin et al2009 another chemical inhibitor pj34 targets the unique ribonucleotide-binding pocket at the n-terminal domain of n protein lin et al2014 it is important to note that most of these inhibitors were designed against the sars virus due to the mutations in the sars-cov-2 virus such inhibitors may not be as effective in fighting against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic lj001 and lj003 are broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that not only inhibit viral entry in the host cells but also damage the viral membrane by producing singlet oxygen molecules unfortunately lj001 is physiologically unstable and is photo-dependent barlow et al2020 nevertheless lj001 defines a new class of antiviral compounds and further research into this class of compounds will yield encouraging results a well-orchestrated cytokine response is critical for the host immune response it has been reported that some sars-cov-2 infected patients demonstrate a hyper-inflammatory response possibly due to deregulated cytokine response it was reported that covid-19 patients in the icu had high cytokines in plasma when compared with non-icu patients suggesting that cytokine dysregulation is involved in the severe form of covid-19 disease channappanavar and perlman 2020 liu et al2020c additionally sars-cov-2-infected patients admitted in icu display increased levels of gm-csf and il6cd4t cells when compared to icu nave patients boettcher et al2007 the above facts point to the possibility that inhibition of excessive inflammatory response might reduce the severity of covid-19 disease corticosteroids are known to have excellent pharmacological potential in suppressing systemic inflammation liu et al2020a zha et al2020 however their use in covid-19 patients is still debatable and requires a detailed study it has been demonstrated that after the onset of sars-cov-2 infection cd4t cells are activated to produce gm-csf and other inflammatory cytokines thus resulting in further induction of cd14cd16 monocytes with high expression of interleukin 6 il-6 conti et al2020 liu et al2020a this observation leads to the possibility that by blocking the il-6 receptor we could potentially reduce immune stress caused by sars-cov-2 in line with this observation a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial is currently underway using an il-6 receptor-specific antibody tocilizumab li et al2020d nct04315480 another recent advance in covid -19 treatments is the convalescent plasma treatment with infection rates growing and no specific therapy available therapy with convalescent plasma cp has been proposed as a principal treatment in this therapy the plasma obtained from a donor recovered from the disease is used to develop humoral immunity against sars-cov-2-infected patients the plasma from the donor patient acts as a source of human antibodies against the infection jawhara 2020 shi et al2020a b however large scale human trials need to be conducted to better understand and evaluate cp as a method of treatment for covid-19
 many pharmaceutical giants have now jumped into the race to find a drug for sars-cov-2 infected patients given the high number of fatalities across the globe even regulatory authorities are giving rapid approvals to conduct clinical trials for promising candidate drugs table 2 shows a list of companies that are conducting clinical trials or are seeking approval from regulatory authorities to conduct trials since the onset of the sars epidemic much knowledge was generated about drug targets and some candidate molecules were developed as well kumar et al2017 however these molecules could not be taken to clinical trials since there were not enough patients suffering from sars virus by the time these drugs were developed nevertheless this information is of tremendous use since sarscov and sars-cov-2 share striking similarities in the genome replication cycle and even symptoms experienced by patients su and lai 2020 systemic genomic comparisons have revealed a striking 79 similarity at the nucleotide level between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov however only 72 nucleotide similarity was observed in the spike s protein of both the viruses zhang and holmes 2020 at the biochemical level both the virus display preferential binding to the ace-2 receptor even at the clinical level the chest x-rays of patients infected with either sars-cov or sars-cov-2 display multilobar ground glass like opacities similarly the ct scan of patients infected with either virus display lobar consolidations ceccarelli et al2020 however since the sars epidemic the virus has mutated considerably and as a result it now has the spike protein which is quite different from the previous version this fact makes efforts to find drugs that inhibit virus entry to host cells quite difficult companies are also relying on drug repurposing beck et al2020 wang et al2020 like chloroquine from sanofi is planned to be tested in coronavirus patients world over meanwhile other companies like abbvie gilead and regeneron are testing known antiviral in combinations in patients affected with the sars-cov-2 virus httpswwwabbviecomcoronavirushtml this approach provides a strategic advantage to the ongoing efforts as the pharmacological effect of single drugs is well-studied on the human body also we know the exact mechanism of action and dose regimen for these antivirals now using them in combination to inhibit more than 2 drug targets can be a winning combination borges do nascimento et al2020 globally scientists and health authorities are eagerly waiting to interpret the results obtained from these trials in the meantime companies like takeda and lilly are working on antibody therapy and evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic molecules at breakneck speed under the aegis of who solidarity clinical trial is underway to evaluate the treatment opportunities available for covid-19 patients the trial is being conducted simultaneously in 30 countries and under this trial four treatment options are being compared against the standard care options for sars-cov-2-infected patients the trial will test the efficacies of remdesivir and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as single agents lopinavir in combination with ritonavir and lopinavir with ritonavir plus interferon beta-1a httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncovsolidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments
 unfortunately at the time of writing this article there are more than 2200000 confirmed patients suffering from sars-cov-2 with more than 152000 reported deaths across the globe novel infectious diseases resulting from the zoonotic transmission of ever-evolving and mutating coronaviruses will continue to pose a global threat to peoples lives and the global economy today despite having suffered from two major coronavirus-related outbreaks like sars and mers the world remains underprepared to formidably accept the challenge of a global pandemic like covid-19 we are still clueless about the handling of the disease and far away from a definite line of treatment against the sars-cov-2 virus it is extremely critical that a concerted effort across the globe is undertaken to find a robust cure for coronaviruses-related illness given the arduous and cost-sensitive road map for novel drug development it is of utmost importance to develop broad-spectrum antivirals that act on common features of the coronavirus lifecycle drug repurposing should be broadened and more combination drugs should be evaluated in patient trials to allow inhibition of the disease through more than one target although there is a lot to learn from the sars and mers epidemic and a lot of research has been performed to develop a suitable cure the same cannot be applied to covid -19 due to viral evolution across the globe serious efforts are ongoing to find compounds and drugs that can decrease covid-19 progression and it is likely that all such prospects have not been covered in this review who in collaboration with microsoft maintains an active database of ongoing trials and compounds active against sars-cov-2 httpswwwwhointictrpsearchen
 extraordinary collaborations and technology exchange in the area of antiviral drug discovery and clinical trials will expedite patient access to more reliable drugs with improved therapeutic potential this will also considerably reduce time-to-market for candidate drugs the current ongoing research should lead to more collective drug discovery efforts where partnership between research institutes and industries will be of paramount importance  repurposing host-based therapeutics to control coronavirus and influenza virus cui-cui li xiao-jia wang hwa-chain wang robert   the repurposing of approved pharmaceutical drugs for additional applications is an efficient and alternative approach to advancing therapeutic development in a cost- and time-effective manner other advantages of repurposing drugs are the existence of clinical data and the availability of affordable drugs for patients viral infection is a major problem of morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide only 12 therapeutic drugs have been approved by the fda to treat viral infections since 2013 and among these agents ten are used to treat hepatitis c virus hcv and hiv one is used to treat cytomegalovirus cmv and one is used to treat influenza virus ifv the limitations of available agents in controlling other viral infections and the emerging resistance to antiviral drugs underline the urgent need for effective drugs to manage viral infections coronavirus cov and ifv see glossary for full list of abbreviations are two major respiratory pathogens causing significant morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide cov is an enveloped positive-sense rna virus classified in the coronaviridae family including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and human coronavirus-229e hcov-229e sars and mers have been well recognized globally owing to their outbreaks of severe infection 1 however the lack of effective therapeutic drugs to control sars and mers means that high morbidity and mortality rates have not reduced 2 in addition to high morbidity and mortality the emergence of new wide-host-range viral members the potential domestic animal adaptation and the difficulty in identifying intermediate hosts are major concerns in the control of cov infection ifv is an enveloped negative-sense rna virus associated with the orthomyxoviridae family consisting of ifv-a -b and -c genera ifv causes seasonal outbreaks of pandemic and zoonotic diseases 3 vaccination has been used to control epidemic ifv for decades antiviral agents have been developed to target ifv m2 ion channels amantadine and rimantadine and neuraminidases zanamivir and oseltamivir however the use of these agents results in substantial drug resistance 4 5 the direct-acting antivirals daas including vaccines and some therapeutic agents are developed to directly target specific viral components however the concerns of these approaches include ineffective control of viral infections and resistance of daas that result from mutation-associated variations and evolved new viral variants thus therapeutics targeting host cellular machineries which are essential for viral infection are considered in developing broad-spectrum agents to overcome viral variations and drug resistance the host-targeted antivirals htas are designed to target specific steps during viral infection including viral binding to host cells viral entry into host cells viral replication and viral budding for example an fda-approved ccr5 receptor antagonist maraviroc mvc is effective to inhibit r5-tropic hiv-1 entry into cells 6 treatment with the humanized igg4 monoclonal antibody ibalizuman which blocks the entry of hiv-1 into cells by noncompetitive binding to cd4 showed that 43 and 50 of patients had a viral load 50 and 200 copies per milliliter respectively at week 25 7 however it is unclear which side-effects result from long-term use of htas in this review we discuss the progress and challenges in the repurposing of clinically approved and preclinically promising therapeutic htas targeting viral entry viral replication and innate immune responses for treating cov and ifv infections cov entry requires host proteases to cleave the viral trimeric transmembrane spike s glycoprotein fig 1 the cleavage of s involves the cysteine protease cathepsin l in the endosomal pathway or the host transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 in a nonendosomal pathway 8 ifv entry requires an envelope fusion with the host membrane via viral hemagglutinin ha followed by the proteolytic cleavage of ha by tmprss11d also hat to initiate endocytosis 9 thus these host proteases in endosomal and nonendosomal pathways can be targeted to block viral entry into host cells 10 tmprss2 activates s glycoprotein of sars-cov and mers-cov for viral entry through the plasma membrane 11 12 camostat is a synthetic low-molecular-weight serine protease inhibitor and is used to treat human dyspepsia associated with mild pancreatic disease 13 inhibition of tmprss2 with camostat results in a 270-fold reduction of mers-cov production in the human bronchial submucosal gland-derived calu-3 cells 11 camostat is also effective at protecting mice from a sars-cov infection 14 the treatment of human tracheal epithelial hte cells with camostat significantly reduces infection by ifv-ah1n1 and ah3n2 viruses 15 nafamostat is an fda-approved serine protease inhibitor to treat pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation 16 17 treatment of the human airway epithelial calu-3 cells with nafamostat blocks mers-cov infection by inhibiting tmprss2 and results in a significant reduction of viral production 18 the ec50 of camostat mesilate and nafamostat for ifv-a are 44 and 082 m respectively in mdck cells and their cc50 values are 1000 and 278 m respectively 19 indicating that these agents are effective at controlling viral infection and safe to host cells a recent screening of the chemical library identified bromhexine hydrochloride bhh as a bioavailable tmprss2 inhibitor 20 because bhh has already been approved by the fda as an ingredient in mucolytic cough suppressants it is likely to be developed to treat cov and ifv infection cathepsins have important roles in cov entry cathepsin l and b can serve as targets for antiviral agents 21 22 the vinylsulfone k11777 is an irreversible cysteine protease inhibitor used to control various parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis 23 k11777 has been reportedly effective in controlling cathepsin-mediated viral entry 14 including sars-cov hcov-229e nipah virus paramyxovirus and ebola virus filovirus however k11777 treatment fails to result in a statistically significant reduction of mortality induced by sars-cov in animals 14 cov and ifv enter host cells via ph- and receptor-mediated endocytosis involving clathrin- and caveolae-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways 24 25 26 ifv also utilizes macropinocytosis as an alternative entry pathway to the acidic late-endosomal compartment 27 28 chlorpromazine cpz an inhibitor for clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the first antipsychotic drug for treating schizophrenia 29 30 cpz was identified by screening fda-approved drugs effective at inhibiting mers-cov replication at low micromolar levels in huh 7 cells cpz inhibits mers-cov replication at an early and a post-entry stage indicating its ability to inhibit the early clathrin-mediated endocytosis and other machineries 31 cpz also inhibits sars-cov and animal coronaviruses with an ic50 value of 88 m in vero cells 32 33 34 treatment of caveolin-1-negative hepg2 cells with cpz significantly reduces the entry of sars-cov into cells 32 these findings indicate that cov mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway to enter cells amiloride a potassium-sparing diuretic is used to treat cardiovascular disease by blocking epithelial sodium channels within the distal tubule of the kidney 35 amiloride derivative 5-n-ethyl-n-isopropyl amiloride eipa is routinely used specifically to inhibit macropinocytic endocytosis 36 a recent report revealed that a combination of eipa with cpz synergistically reduces the ability of ifv-a to infect the bovine kidney mdck cells 28 indicating that clathrin-mediated endocytic and macropinocytic pathways are used by ifv to enter cells thus combining complementary agents needs to be further developed to achieve an effective control of viral entry into host cells cellular vacuolar atpase v-atpase located at the intracellular organelles and cytoplasmic membranes acidifies the late endosome by pumping protons across the endosomal membrane which is a crucial step for cov and ifv entry 37 38 blocking v-atpase activity interferes with viral infection by preventing the ph-dependent membrane fusion of viral envelops with the endosomal membrane saliphenylhalamide saliphe is an anticancer compound capable of inhibiting v-atpase 39 saliphe inhibits acidification of endosomes and reduces production of progeny viruses at ic50 values of 003 and 008 m in ifv-a-infected mdck and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial a549 cells respectively 38 40 administrating mice with 7 mgkg saliphe three-times daily for 8 days resulted in a 625 survival rate from lethal ifv infection and mice recovered by 15 days 38 packing saliphe with nanoparticles enhances the in vitro stability and antiviral activity with low cytotoxicity 41 diphyllin a natural compound isolated from cleistanthus collinus has been identified as a novel v-atpase inhibitor 42 diphyllin inhibits endosomal acidification in human osteoclasts and reduces v-atpase expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cells 43 diphyllin has been shown to effectively inhibit ifv infection in mdck cells with ic50 values ranging from 004 to 063 m 44 diphyllin also effectively inhibits the clinically isolated oseltamivir-resistant ifv-asan diego212008 h1n1 strain which carries a drug-resistant mutation h275y in the na gene and the amantadine-resistant apr834 strain 44 diphyllin is well tolerated in mice 43 delivery of diphyllin by nanoparticles increases its antiviral effects on feline cov and it is also well tolerated in mice 45 niclosamide a salicylanilide has been used to treat parasitic helminthic infestations in humans for 40 years 46 niclosamide acts as a proton carrier to target acidic endosomes and to neutralize the ph of coated vesicles or synthetic liposomes 47 niclosamide effectively inhibits ifv-a in a549 cells 47 and ph-dependent sars-cov infection 48 amiodarone an antiarrhythmic agent is used clinically to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias 49 amiodarone inhibits sars-cov infection at a post-endosomal stage and the pretreatment with amiodarone results in a 10 000-fold reduction of viral production in vero cells 50 imatinib is an inhibitor for the non-receptor tyrosine kinase abelson abl which is involved in the regulation of cellular pathways for cell migration adhesion and actin reorganization 51 imatinib is used as an anticancer agent to reduce cml-related disease progression and death 52 53 imatinib is also an endosomal membrane fusion inhibitor capable of inhibiting sars-cov and mers-cov infection with ec50 values of 982 and 1769 m respectively 2 54 pretreatment with imatinib reduces 1000-fold mers-cov and sars-cov production in vero cells and is safe to vero cells cc50 value 100 m 54 however use of 400 mg imatinib daily in myeloid leukemia patients comes with the side-effects dizziness blurred vision or somnolence fda guide administration of imatinib at 60 or 30 mgkgday resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the longevity of males and females respectively tmprss2 plays an important part in nonendosomal pathways to support the entry of viruses into cells and the assembly of viral particles for cov and ifv the inhibition of the nonendosomal tmprss2 by camostat or nafamostat does result in suppression of cov infection but inhibition of the endosomal cathepsin by k11777 does not thus tmprss2 but not cathepsins is a promising target for antiviral therapeutic development camostat and nafamostat are fda-approved drugs camostat has been shown to exhibit a potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo thus it is logical to further determine the efficacy of camostat in the control of cov and ifv in clinical studies endosomal acidification facilitates membrane fusion between endosomes and virions for viral entry imatinib an fda-approved agent inhibits cov fusion with the endosomal membrane in vitro
2 54 thus the in vivo efficacy of imatinib in the control of viral infection needs to be determined in an animal model treatment of animals with the v-atpase inhibitors saliphe or diphyllin reduces acidification and suppresses viral infection and packing with nanoparticles helps to increase the efficacy of these inhibitors in controlling viral infection with tolerable adverse effects in animals thus these agents are promising in pursuing fda approval for their clinical application to control viral infection viral replication requires pyrimidine nucleotides and continued biosynthesis of pyrimidine 55 the pyrimidine nucleosides include uridine cytidine and thymidine dihydroorotate dehydrogenase dhodh dehydrogenizes dihydroorotate to orotic acid a key step in biosynthesis of de novo pyrimidine to generate uracil which binds with a ribose sugar to form the ribonucleoside uridine for transcription 56 the dhodh inhibitors teriflunomide or its prodrug leflunomide and brequinar are used as immunosuppressive agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis patients 57 although these agents showed an ability to inhibit de novo pyrimidine synthesis that contributes to their broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro their antiviral activity is ineffective in vivo resulting from exogenously provided uridine and bypassing the inhibited biosynthesis of pyrimidine to sustain viral replication 58 59 recent studies showed the small-molecule gsk983 was capable of inhibiting dhodh and effective in blocking replication of various viruses and arresting cell growth 60 61 supplying exogenous deoxycytidine to sustain cellular dna synthesis but not rna results in reducing gsk983 cytotoxicity without reducing gsk983-mediated inhibition of dengue virus denv replication 61 thus the combined use of deoxycytidine with gsk983 provides an intriguing strategy with reduced cytotoxicity to safely use dhodh inhibitors in controlling rna viruses gemcitabine an fda-approved anticancer agent is a fluorouracil analog capable of inhibiting pyrimidine biosynthesis 62 although gemcitabine was expected to interfere with pyrimidine biosynthesis in viral replication 63 gemcitabine showed a limited antiviral ability 40 whether gemcitabine can be repurposed to control viral infection remains to be clarified the protein translation process consists of three steps initiation elongation and termination initiation of translation in eukaryotes is a rate-limiting step of protein synthesis involving the family of eukaryotic initiation factors eifs eif4f consisting of eif4a eif4e and eif4g recruits the small ribosome subunit and binds to the m7gtp residue at the 5-end of mrnas for cap-dependent translation 64 many viruses utilize host eifs to initiate translation 65 phosphorylation of eif2 plays an important part in regulating initiation 66 thus eif and eif phosphorylation could be targeted to develop antiviral agents the helicase eif4a unwinds mrna 5-untranslated region facilitating the assembly of translation preinitiation complexes 78 silvestrol a natural compound isolated from the plant aglaia foveolata is an inhibitor of eif4a 79 silvestrol has been shown to control cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
80 81 silvestrol can inhibit the translation and replication of mers-cov and hcov-229e in human embryonic lung fibroblast mrc-5 cells with ec50 values of 0001 and 0003 m respectively 82 cov uses cap-independent cis-acting rna internal ribosome entry site ires elements with eif4a for viral translation that can also be inhibited by silvestrol 83 interestingly silvestrol exhibits a potent and modest ability to inhibit ifv-a infection in a549 cells and mdck cells respectively but fails to inhibit viral infection in vero cells 84 the antiviral effect of silvestrol on ifv infection is reversible where drug withdrawal results in rapid dissolution of stalled preinitiation complexes stress granules and resumption of viral protein synthesis inhibition of ifv-a by silvestrol is associated with cytotoxicity 84 by contrast pateamine a irreversibly binds to eif4a to result in an extended blockade of ifv-a replication after drug withdrawal and it inhibits ifv-a replication in all a549 mdck and vero cells with minimal cytotoxicity 84 these findings indicate the eif4a is a promising target for therapeutic development to inhibit viral translation and replication by agents such as silvestrol and pateamine a the erk pathway mainly mediates intracellular signals from membrane-associated ras to the cytoplasmic kinase cascade raf mek and erk 86 the erk pathway plays an important part in the regulation of gene transcription protein translation cell death and cell cycle machinery oncogenic mutation of the b-raf gene v600e is frequently detectable in human cancers 87 the b-raf v600e inhibitor vemurafenib which effectively inhibits the erk pathway was approved by the fda to treat orbital erdheimchester disease ecd 88 89 vemurafenib at low micromolar levels can inhibit ifv-a replication 1000-fold reduction via suppression of viral translation 90 interestingly vemurafenib also inhibits virus-induced apoptosis in a549 cells via the suppression of apoptosis-inducing cytokines 90 other raf inhibitors such as dabrafenib and sorafenib were fda-approved to treat cancer these raf inhibitors could be further studied to repurpose them for the control of viral infection it has been reported that the blockage of the erk pathway limits the replication of cov and ifv treatment with u0126 a specific inhibitor of mek12 suppresses early steps of the replication of mouse hepatitis virus mhv in various cell lines 91 treatment of cells with u0126 significantly reduces the replication of ifv-a and nasal administration of u0126 protects mice from a lethal infection with ifv-a without developing any adverse effects 92 treatment of h1n1-infected mice with the mek inhibitor ci-1040 reduces 80 viral production in the lung 93 however the low bioavailability of ci-1040 needs improving for it to be an effective antiviral agent 94 the mek12 inhibitor trametinib and the erk12 inhibitor selumetinib which are fda-approved anticancer agents can effectively inhibit mers-cov infection 85 trametinib also inhibits replication of various ifv strains fpvh7n7 sc35mh7n7 pr8mh1n1 in vitro and in vivo by interfering with the export of progeny vrnps from the nucleus pretreatment with trametinib ec50

117 118 activation of nf-b is a hallmark for detecting viral infections 119 nf-b plays an important part in the regulation of genes involved in the inflammation counteracting viral infection 119 however ifv-a can take advantage of nf-b activation via the degradation of ib for viral replication 119 thus nf-b could be targetable for interfering with ifv replication 120 saikosaponin a ssa a lipophilic triterpene saponin derived from radix bupleurum has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties 121 122 ssa inhibits nf-b activation and effectively attenuates ifv-a replication at ic50 values of 155 162 and 173 gml for h1n1 h5n1 and h9n2 strains respectively in a549 cells daily subcutaneous injection with ssa at 50 mgkg for six consecutive days beginning at 4 h post-infection protects mice from a lethal infection of ifv-a 123 treatment of mice with the nf-b inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester cape andor parthenolide reduces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung and significantly increases animal survival 17 to 3356 from sars-cov infection 124 the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ps-341 an anticancer drug suppresses ib degradation to result in blocking nf-b activation 125 126 it was shown that ps-341 at a noncytotoxic level of 005 m can reduce ifv-a replication up to three orders of magnitude in a549 cells however 01 m ps-341 becomes cytotoxic 127 thus concerning the antiviral activity of ps-341 in association with cytotoxicity ps-341-associated adverse effects need to be carefully determined for developing an optimal antiviral agent in addition stronger neo-minophagen c snmc a glycyrrhizin preparation has been approved in japan to treat chronic hepatic diseases 128 glycyrrhizin is an antioxidant anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory and antiviral agent 129 130 glycyrrhizin suppresses ifv-a replication in part through interference with virus-induced proinflammatory gene expression 131 glycyrrhizin can suppress sars-cov infection at the early entry and the late replication stages in vero cells with an ec50 value of 300 gml 132 andrographis paniculata is an anti-inflammatory antipyretic analgesic antibacterial and hepatoprotective agent 133 and the major component 14-deoxy-1112-dehydroandrographolide dap suppressed gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as ifv-a replication 134 135 these results suggest that anti-inflammatory agents could be further developed for the therapeutic control of ifv-a and sars-cov infection the broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide is a safe drug for treating intestinal infection by cryptosporidium parvum
136 137 nitazoxanide is currently undergoing studies to control viral infections nitazoxanide can interfere with post-translational modification of ifv hemagglutinin in human and animal cells with ic50 values ranging from 02 to 15 gml and nitazoxanide is reportedly effective in controlling ifv-a and -b infection in a phase iii clinical study 138 nitazoxanide has also been shown to inhibit mers-cov infection of mice and llc-mk2 cells with an ic50 value of 092 gml by suppressing expression of the viral n protein and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 139 accordingly nitazoxanide is regarded highly as a promising antiviral agent repurposed from an antiparasitic agent lanthionine synthetase c like 2 lancl2 is a therapeutic target

lethal infection of ifv-a h1n1 143 pandemic and zoonotic ifv strains are serious concerns in public health particularly in the population lacking preexisting immunity recent development of antiviral agents in modulating host immune responses has substantially advanced the fields of virology and pharmaceutics as well as significantly contributed to healthcare advances in humans and animals nsc61610 and lpg have been shown to effectively control ifv-a infection in animals by activating the immune response these agents should be considered in clinical trials for treating viral infection by contrast ssa cape glycyrrhizin and dap are undergoing in vitro and in vivo studies to reveal their ability to control viral infection however adverse effects of these immune-modulating agents need to be seriously clarified developing a new drug can take 15 years and cost billions of us dollars approximately one-in-ten new promising preclinical drugs identified from hundreds of compounds might be approved for clinical use approximately 30 of new drugs fail to pass safety protocols in clinical trials repurposing fda-approved drugs is a time-efficient cost-effective and safe approach to developing therapeutic drugs for the new indication of treating viral infection to repurpose an fda-approved drug such as anticancer and other agents researchers still need to go through in vitro in vivo and clinical studies to determine the value of a candidate drug for treating ifv andor cov diseases in vitro studies can identify viral strains to be targeted determine the host cell range susceptible to viral infection and reveal additional molecular targets specifically for controlling viral infection the value of host molecular targets can be evaluated by gene knockdown knockout or mutation via the methods of rna interference or crisprcas9 in vivo studies will determine the maximal tolerable doses and adverse effects efficacy in controlling viral infection and pharmacokinetics of drug concentrations in the plasma to reestablish an effective and safe regimen and protocol for treating ifv andor cov diseases the new in vitro and in vivo results will be considered with existing data together to design clinical studies for viral diseases inevitably there are challenges to the repurposing of drugs for antiviral therapeutics in general viral infection is an acute pathogenesis that can require higher doses of a repurposed drug than doses used in treating originally targeted chronic diseases for an optimal outcome thus the administration route and toxicity of a repurposed drug need to be carefully determined viral infection also results in changes in not only the hosts immune system but also the function of the hosts organs which could interfere with pharmacological effects of a repurposed drug or cause additional side effects thus it will be beneficial to study combination therapies capable of targeting viral components modulating cellular machineries and alleviating adverse effects to achieve optimal outcomes of increased antiviral efficacy reduced viral resistance and minimized toxicity and side effects  drug repurposing using computational methods to identify therapeutic options for covid-19 soodeh mahdian azadeh ebrahim-habibi mahboobeh zarrabi   in 2019 wuhan china was the host of a new type of coronavirus that caused sars-like symptoms in human beings in order to better know this new virus phylogenetic analysis was conducted considering the complete viral genome 29903 nucleotides the results revealed that the new virus has 891 nucleotide similarity to genus betacoronavirus -subgenus sarbecovirus- that had previously caused an epidemic infectious disease known as sars 1 the new virus is called covid-19 which contains major structural proteins spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein the schematic representation of a coronavirus is shown in fig 1 among them s protein can promote fusion of the viral and cellular membranes so it facilitates the entry of coronavirus into the host cells 1 s protein with 1288 amino acid consists of s1 and s2 subunits that mediates the fusion between the viral and host cell membranes these subunits include the receptor-binding domain rbd and fusion peptide fp heptad repeat 1 hr1 heptad repeat 2 hr2 transmembrane domain tm and cytoplasmic domain fusion cp s1 and s2 have different roles in this entry s1 plays a vital role in binding cellular receptor and s2 can facilitate viral fusion and entry 2 a conserved receptor binding domain rbd connects to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 that is known to interact with 14 aa in the s1 of sars-cov studies also show that ace2 is a receptor of covid-19 moreover sequence variations of the spike protein cleavage site are important in terms of cellular tropism and pathogenesis the cleavage site in the s-protein sequence is involved in the pathogenesis of virus the sequence of s-protein in covid-19 has 12 extra nucleotides upstream to the single arg cleavage site 1 which results in prrarsv sequence that is solvent-exposed and resembles a cleavage site 3 the reason for the well-organized spread of the virus among the population is this new cleavage site previous coronaviruses lacked this system as mentioned earlier the s2 subunit in covid-19 is responsible for the facilitation of viral fusion and entry into the host cell there exists a kind of interaction regarding cellular membranes between heptad repeats 1 hr1 and heptad repeat 2 hr2 which leads to fusion the changes in the interaction pattern between hr1 and hr2 domains in covid-19 s2 in terms of fusion with cell membranes are caused by mutations inside the hr1 core region 4 8 residues out of 21 indicate mutation 38 difference it is currently claimed that ace2 could be the host receptor for covid-19 as well perhaps the susceptibility symptoms and outcome of covid-19 infection are resulted by the expression level and pattern of ace2 in tissues according to the recent research single-cell analysis of rna-sequencing rna-seq shows a higher expression of ace2 in asian males 5 covid-19 engages ace2 as a receptor for entry into the host cell and employs the cellular transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 for s protein priming tmprss2 activates the viral s protein which facilitates virus-cell membrane fusions 6 residues near lysine 31 and tyrosine 41 8284 and 353357 in human ace2 play an important role in the binding of s-protein coronavirus the adipose tissue might be in a weak position regarding covid-19 because ace2 expression in adipose tissue was higher than that in lung tissue considering five different types of cancers the researchers realized that the expression of ace2 remarkably increases in tumor tissues compared to other neighboring tissues hence it is suggested that during covid-19 obese individuals and patients who suffer from these five types of cancer should be prioritized 7 in terms of gender and age it should be mentioned that the expression of ace2 is positively associated with age 8 9 eight hundred kda polypeptide is produced during transcription of the covid-19 genome this polypeptide is cleaved to produce various proteins meanwhile papain-like protease plpro and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro facilitate proteolytic processing papain-like proteinase plpro is responsible for the cleavages at the n-terminus of replicase polyprotein 3clpro plays an important role in coronaviruses and is strongly preserved in this family of viruses proteins necessary for viral replication are nonstructural and are produced by 3clpro which activate the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites this process would prepare the ground for virus replication hence to find anti-viral activities in compounds researchers pay careful attention to 3clpro 10 some options are suggested as a treatment for covid-19 among which drug repositioning repurposing is considered as the only answer to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases drug repurposing is an effective strategy to treat new diseases caused by infectious agents that spread rapidly in this paper the drug repurposing strategy is applied using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for covid-19 homology modeling was used to generate five proteins of covid-193clpro plpro cleavage site hr1 and rbd in spike protein and tmprss2 the homology models of these proteins were done in the swiss-model workspace 11 12 httpsswissmodelexpasyorgdocsreferences protein data bank

3drefine server and the package of gromacs 514 were applied to minimize energy in the optimized model of the protein 14 the section of small-molecules of the drug bank database 15 httpswwwdrugbankcaabout was used to obtain all fda-approved drugs the non-unique structures that were removed during the process are as follows the compounds containing rare atoms selenium platinum gold silicon and organometallic compounds finally the screening database had 2471 compounds pyrx tool was used for energy minimizing and preparing ligands in pdbqt format and autodock vina was applied for virtual screening it was used autodock vina for drug discovery to screen libraries of compounds against targets 16 17 the box was centered on a specific area this position using pockdrug server and it was determined by using data in uniprot about the main amino acids in the bond according to previous evidence the cleavage site in the s-protein and the conserved receptor binding domain rbd is important role in the pathogenesis of virus so at the first these two targets were selected for virtual screening with all fda-approved drugs the drugs that had the desired binding energy at this stage and were reported to have antiviral properties were then selected for the next step therefore virtual screening was performed for the selected drugs with ace2 3clpro and plpro and hr1 and tmprss2 in the next step 2-d representations of proteinligand complexes are shown using ligplot program 18 httpswwwebiacukthornton-srvsoftwareligplot fda-approved drugs were screened against cleavage

cleavage site and rbd in spike protein of these 128 drugs 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ace2 major covid19 receptor 3clpro and plpro main enzymes in viral replication and hr1 main domain in virus fusion with the host cell membrane and tmprss2 main enzyme in activating the viral spike glycoproteins according to the results 7 drugs with all the target proteins achieved the most favorable free binding energy table 1 the protein complexes with these seven drugs are shown in figs 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions of docked molecules were visualized using ligplot program table 2 as shown in table 2 glycyrrhizic acid and hesperidin showed highest number of bonds with ace2 and rbd as shown in table 1 paritaprevir and simeprevir have favorable binding energy to most target proteins and may be considered as therapeutic options for the coronavirus these drugs were originally used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c and can effectively bind to target proteins 10 19 20 there are other drugs with good binding energy to target protein one of them is ledipasvir according to an in silico study ledipasvir is an antiviral drug with the minimum side effects that can be applied in the treatment of covid19 21 in the present study medicinal compounds of plant origin were also attached with favorable binding energy to the target proteins glycyrrhizic acid which has plant origins is obtained from the roots of the licorice plant triterpene glycoside and glycyrrhetinic acid are used pharmacologically the latter is applied as a hepatoprotective option to treat chronic hepatitis in japan and china httpspubchemncbinlmnihgovcompoundglycyrrhizic-acid in addition glycyrrhizin being non-toxic 22 is also used widely as a sars treatment option according to a study in 2003 glycyrrhizin has a preventive role in sars 23 furthermore based on studies it plays an effective role in the hepatitis c virus hcv because it can influence the release phase associated with the infection of cells 24 using glycyrrhizin to treat hepatitis c is not a new method and it has been applied as a treatment for 20 years in japan fortunately the studies have shown its preventive role in the progression of cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma and only few side effects 25 the positive effects of glycyrrhizin have been proven on many viral diseases such as herpes simplex type 1 hsv-1 varicella-zoster virus vzv hepatitis a hav and b virus hbv human immunodeficiency virus hiv severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and coronavirus epsteinbarr virus ebv human cytomegalovirus and influenza virus 24 glycyrrhizic acids preventive impact on ace2 has been reported in some studies 26 aside from glycyrrhizic acid hesperidin and tannic acid are also considered in medical circles they have plant origins as well and can attach to proteins with good binding energy hesperidin is a flavonoid extracted from citrus fruit it has multiple biological and antimicrobial activities against human viruses based on a study conducted in 2009 glucosyl hesperidin has an inhibiting role against the replication of influenza a virus 27 in a study aimed at analyzing therapeutic targets for covid-19 by computational methods it was shown that hesperidin disrupts in the interaction of ace2 with rbd 1 as mentioned earlier the 3clpro can be an effective target for treatment of coronavirus a study on investigation of the effect of active compounds on the inhibition of 3clpro showed that hesperidin was the most potent inhibitor of 3clpro among the compounds which were tested based on docking score it was reported that hesperidin and glycyrrhizin are favorable in terms of binding to ace2 and 3clpro 28 tmc-310911 is another fda-approved drug that has good binding with target proteins tmc-310911 is a new

with the most suitable free-binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and rbd in spike protein out of these 128 drugs 18 drugs were antiviral virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ace2 major covid19 receptor 3clpro and plpro main enzymes in viral replication hr1 main domain in virus fusion with the host cell membrane and tmprss2 main enzyme in activating the viral spike glycoproteins according to the data of this study as well as the related literature paritaprevir simeprevir ledipasvir glycyrrhizic acid tmc-310911 and hesperidin can be suitable candidates for further investigation on the treatment of covid-19 infection it seems that investigations of rna polymerase inhibitors may be effective for better selection of drugs in the treatment of covid-19  drug repurposing approaches for the treatment of influenza viral infection reviving old drugs to fight against a long-lived enemy andrs pizzorno blandine padey olivier terrier manuel rosa-calatrava   despite its apparent blandness for the collective mindset of an important portion of the society the intrinsic morbidity and mortality as well as the related deaths because of bacterial superinfections or exacerbation of chronic illnesses make of influenza infections a major and recurrent global public health concern indeed human influenza type a and b viruses are responsible for annual flu epidemics marked by up to 1 billion infections 35 million severe cases and 300000650000 deaths worldwide with an huge economic burden in terms of medical visits hospitalizations workschool absenteeism and productivity loss 13 as members of the orthomyxoviridae family influenza viruses type a b c or d are enveloped viruses harboring a negative-sense single-stranded rna segmented genome in such segmented nature of the viral genome resides the capacity of influenza viruses to form new reassortant strains following the concomitant infection of a host with more than one strain of human andor animal origin a phenomenon so far observed only among type a influenza viruses reviewed in 4 owing to viral reassortment the genetic baggage of progeny viruses does not exactly match that of one of the parental strains but a combination of both depending on the specific combination of genetic segments and notably in the case of a human influenza strain acquiring the hemagglutinin ha andor neuraminidase na major surface antigens from animal origin reassortment events can result in an antigenic shift defined as the generation of a new virus with antigenic properties drastically different from those of the circulating strains should this new variant be sufficiently antigenically different to escape the repertoire of pre-existing immunity in the population it might rapidly disseminate and replace the circulating strains hence triggering a global influenza pandemic although relatively rarethree veritable pandemics occurred during the 20th century and one so far in the twenty-first centurythe outbreak of pandemics is a quite unpredictable event that might entail potentially devastating effects reviewed in 5 particularly considering the contemporary state of affairs regarding global transportation and trade migration and the narrowing interface between rural and overcrowded urban areas influenza vaccination constitutes the most effective strategy to prevent seasonal flu and its clinical complications mainly among high-risk populations such as very young children the elderly pregnant women immunocompromised patients as well as people with obesity diabetes or cardiorespiratory comorbidities 6 7 nevertheless current flu vaccination still presents several limitations that make it fall short of expectations in terms of effectiveness the short duration of vaccine-induced immunity coupled with the intrinsic antigenic drift of influenza viruses resulting from the gradual accumulation of point mutations in the antigenic sites of the ha and to a lesser extent the na surface protein underscore the need of the annual reformulation of vaccine composition moreover the length of the current vaccine manufacturing process at least 6 months to produce sufficiently large vaccine quantities demands continual strain selection to be done approximately 8 months before the next flu season 6 8 should an antigenic drift occur during this time window the possibility of a mismatch between the vaccine composition and circulating strains might negatively affect protection even in the absence of seasonal mismatches or the emergence of pandemic strains insufficient vaccine coverage and suboptimal uptake in specific target groups ie the elderly or the immunocompromised also compromise vaccine effectiveness furthermore despite the recent progress made in the pursue of the holy grail of a universal influenza vaccine that can provide broader long-lasting protection against both matching and antigenically diverse influenza strains 9 10 their clinical effectiveness remains to be evaluated hence highlighting the need of complementary therapeutic approaches to manage influenza infections besides vaccination antiviral drugs represent the other pillar for the control of seasonal influenza epidemics and play a central role as major prophylactic and therapeutic agents in the event of a pandemic outbreak in that regard this review summarizes the state-of-the-art of current antiviral options against influenza infection with a particular focus on the recent advances of anti-influenza drug repurposing strategies and their potential therapeutic regulatory and economic benefits this review presents examples of the multiple ways to reposition molecules for the treatment of influenza from adventitious discovery to in silico-based screening these novel antiviral candidates many of which target the host cell could also be used in combination with conventional virus-targeted antiviral agents in order to reinforce our very limited therapeutic arsenal against influenza virus infections as mentioned above antivirals are key players in pandemic preparedness programs being the first choice for the treatment of infected patients as well as for preventive post-exposure prophylaxis of those potentially exposed to the new virus especially during the initial pandemic period in which no vaccine is available antivirals are as well important in the normal seasonal setting although their use is mostly focused on the treatment of severely ill patients and the immunocompromised some countries including the usa and japan regularly resort to antivirals for the management of uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy patients 11 12 to date only two classes of antiviral agents are globally approved and available for the treatment of influenza infections m2 ion-channel blockers and neuraminidase na inhibitors the first class includes adamantane derivatives amantadine and rimantadine which inhibit proton conductivity of the m2 ion channel of influenza a viruses hence preventing the viral uncoating step of the viral replication cycle nevertheless although quite efficient in their early days widespread dissemination of the s31n and to a much lesser extent v27a m2 resistance mutation in post-2006 h3n2 and post-2009 h1n1 circulating strains prompted the who to remove both amantadine and rimantadine from the list of recommended anti-influenza agents for clinical use in 2009 6 as a result na inhibitors stand as the only influenza antivirals currently recommended by the who 13 na inhibitors are competitive analogs of sialic acid the preferred influenza receptor on the host cells surface by binding to the broadly conserved active site of the na na inhibitors interfere with the sialidase enzymatic activity of the viral protein which is essential for the release of newly formed progeny viruses from the infected cell hence preventing the spread of infection to the rest of the respiratory tissue 14 three na inhibitors are currently licensed worldwide for the treatment of influenza a and b infections oseltamivir zanamivir and peramivir oral oseltamivir administered as its prodrug oseltamivir phosphate is the most largely used of the three whereas inhaled zanamivir is not recommended for very young children nor for individuals with underlying respiratory conditions and intravenous peramivir is prioritized in hospitalized patients that cannot receive oral treatment 15 additionally inhaled laninamivir a single-dose long lasting na inhibitor is approved in japan for the prevention and treatment of influenza a and b in both adult and pediatric patients 16 it is important to note that some degree of skepticism is still present regarding the real efficacy of na inhibitors notably following the 2014s cochrane clinical meta-analysis that reported only a minimal shortening of influenza symptoms in children and adults with uncomplicated influenza but not in hospitalized patients 17 nevertheless actual evidence-based consensus points to a moderate efficacy of na inhibitor treatment in reducing symptom duration pneumonia hospitalization and mortality especially when administered within 48 h from symptom onset 18 19 conversely delayed treatment initiation is associated with compromised efficacy but may yet be beneficial in at-risk patients moreover the emergence of na inhibitor-resistant virus variants is a matter of concern with particularly higher frequencies among children and the immunocompromised 20 the h275y na substitution is the main mutation responsible for both oseltamivir and peramivir resistance in h1n1 viruses while r292k and e119v are the most commonly reported in h3n2 viruses these latter two also conferring reduced susceptibility to zanamivir and laninamivir 17 21 even if nowadays the prevalence of drug-resistance in circulating strains is quite low 1 evidence form pre-2009 seasonal strains has proved that given the appropriate conditions resistance could rapidly disseminate to attain a prevalence of 90100 17 21 in that regard the relatively recent detection of localized clusters of na inhibitor-resistant h1n1pdm09 viruses harboring the h274y mutation combined or not with i222rv na substitutions 22 23 strengthens the importance of continuous surveillance in addition to m2 ion channel blockers and na inhibitors two small molecules that target the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase favipiravir and baloxavir marboxil are undergoing clinical evaluation in the us and europe but already obtained approval by japanese health authorities favipiravir is a nucleoside analog that acts as a competitive inhibitor of viral polymerase substrate approved since 2014 for the treatment of influenza infections with newly emerging strains andor resistant to other antiviral agents however despite the apparent high threshold for drug resistance 24 and broad-spectrum antiviral potential notably validated in the context of recent ebola virus outbreaks 25 recent results of phase iiiii randomized trials on its therapeutic efficacy against uncomplicated influenza were not completely conclusive 26 baloxavir marboxil is a selective inhibitor of the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of the influenza viral pa polymerase subunit 27 therefore interfering with the cap-snatching activity of the viral polymerase complex in that regard a very recent report disclosed for the first time the results of two randomized phases ii and iii clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of a single-dose oral treatment with baloxavir marboxil in otherwise healthy outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza compared with placebo and a regular 5-day treatment with oseltamivir 28 overall baloxavir marboxil and oseltamivir moderately reduced the time to symptom alleviation compared to placebo while the former outperformed the two others in reducing viral loads these results prompted the us food and drug administration fda to approve xofluza baloxavir marboxil for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 12 years of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 h 29 nevertheless this first antiviral flu treatment with a novel mechanism of action approved by the fda in nearly 20 years does not seem to escape the problem of all other virus-targeted anti-influenza agents the emergence of virus variants mostly due to the i38tm pa amino acid substitutions conferring significant levels of reduced susceptibility to baloxavir marboxil was observed in up to 97 of the patients receiving the drug 28 30 overall table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the abovementioned currently available antiviral options for influenza such limited therapeutic arsenal coupled with the recurrent risk of emerging drug-resistance highlights the obvious unmet need of novel approaches to complement existing therapies with new anti-influenza drugs some of the best-known success stories of drug repurposing have their starting point on serendipitous observations recorded in the context of either preclinical models of disease or pre-post-approval clinical trials leading to a subsequent rationalized evaluation and validation of the new treatment potential 41 thalidomide and sildenafil are two examples of such key observations the first one was initially introduced as an anti-nausea for pregnant women but had to be rapidly removed from the market due to its teratogenicity further research enabled this molecule as well as some derivatives to be repurposed for the treatment of leprosy and multiple myeloma 45 sildenafil on the other hand never reached the market for its originally intended use in the treatment of hypertension but the observed side-effects on erectile dysfunction ended in its approval in under the commercial name of viagra more recently sildenafil found a third life under the commercial brand of revatio for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension 46 although serendipitous observation has historically proved its usefulness the intrinsic necessity of the casual observation of an unintended and usually infrequent second benefit poses a significant hurdle for exploiting the full potential of drug repurposing for which more controlled systematic methodologies are needed target-based repurposing relies on having previous knowledge of the specific molecular or cellular determinantfunction target recognized by the drug intended to be repurposed if new research finds out that target is plays an important role in a condition or disease other than the original indication there is a potential for repurposing of note the target might but not necessarily has to play the same role in both conditions for example in the case of the previously mentioned favipiravir the drug plays the same role as viral rna polymerase inhibitor against both influenza and ebola viruses on the other hand the abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2 abl2 target of the anticancer drug imatinib has been found to be required for efficient fusion and release of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov pseudovirions into the cytoplasm of the infected cell a key step for viral replication 47 an alternative scenario of target-based repurposing can happen when a particular drug of known mechanism of action is found to have a new molecularcellular target and this previously unrecognized second target is associated with a different disease the molecule is therefore said to present polypharmacology-related features meaning the capacity to act on multiple targets 48 49 polypharmacological phenomena includes both a single drug acting on multiple targets of a unique disease pathway or a single drug acting on multiple targets pertaining to multiple disease pathways 50 in fact polypharmacology is usually responsible for treatment toxicity or other undesirable adverse events but some of these side-effects might also lead to drug repurposing as further exemplified in the next sections during the last decade an increasing number of studies converged on proposing that many drugs initially designed for a unique therapeutics target are in fact expected to hit on average between 6 and 13 different targets 51 52 one major limitation of the target-based drug repurposing model relies on its dependence on the existing scientific knowledge of the drugdisease mechanisms of actionpathology as well as on potential alternative targets which is usually incomplete in other words we cannot fully anticipate the repurposing potential of a drug unless we have characterized its molecularcellular targets or if we do not know that a given drug target plays an important role on a particular disease phenotypic screening of bioactive molecule libraries in different experimental cell-based or in vivo disease models without the need of a priori knowledge or consideration of the target andor mechanism of action the candidate was designed to modulate can provide valuable contribution to overcome this constraint 53 indeed despite this approach has been questioned due to the fact that the expected altered phenotype readout as a surrogate of an exploitable biological effect induced by the drug candidate might account for an important number of false positive hits it is nonetheless true that the contribution of high-throughput phenotypic screening to first-in-class small molecule drug discovery exceeded that of target-based approaches 54 55 in that regard many well-annotated collections of small-molecule libraries could be readily made available through different collaborative andor commercial partnerships in order to accelerate drug repurposing through hypothesis biased or unbiased phenotypic screening reviewed in 5457 with the advent of big data and systems biology computer-based approaches are gaining increasing acceptance in the field of drug discovery and drug repurposing is not an exception besides the inclusion of constantly emerging omics eg transcriptomic proteomic metabolomic data to expand our current knowledge of drugdisease-associated mechanisms in silico data mining and modeling tools have pushed our capacity to analyze data to the next level 5860 these in silico methods include the screening of chemical biological and text databases analysis of quantitative structure-activity relationships pharmacophores homology models and other molecular modeling approaches as well as network analysis of biological functions machine learning and almost any other analysis tools that include using a computer 6164 in that regard proper mining of biological chemical and clinical datasets has proved effective in unveiling novel relationships 65 66 moreover another level of complexity can be added by combining for example epidemiologic information obtained in-house andor from publicly available literature databases with in vitro experimental molecule screenings with the aim to identify novel indications as in the case of digoxin and prostate cancer 67 68 indeed the real power of computer-assisted drug repurposing resides on adopting an integrative strategy that combines the predictive and analytic capacity of in silico tools with some of the target biased or unbiased experimental evaluationvalidation methods previously mentioned this systems pharmacology approach 6971 across the boundaries of traditional disciplines would put researchers in a better-informed position to design more comprehensive repurposing strategies with more effective predictive capacity and hopefully improved candidate success rates these last 10 years there has been a remarkable growing interest for drug repurposing in the field of antiviral drug discovery fueled by the incontestable reality of many known viral infections still lacking specific treatment this interest is inversely correlated with the very low number of classic antiviral molecules that have been market-approved these last 5 years mostly for the treatment of hepatitis c virus or hiv-related pathologies 72 the best example of antiviral drug repurposing approaches are emerging viruses such as ebola zika virus or mers-cov for which there is an urgent and cost-effective need for therapeutics solutions indeed to rapidly propose a solution in the context of a viral outbreak one interesting approach consists to look at the available pharmacopeia used to treat pathogens for example chloroquine a major antimalarial drug has been proposed for the treatment of filoviral infections and more largely for the treatment of other emerging pathogens as it targets endosomal acidification a pivotal step in the replication cycle of a large number of viruses 73 74 another interesting illustration is the previously cited example of favipiravir which proved its repurposing potential for the treatment of zika or ebola viral infections 25 43 75 as mentioned before the intrinsic ever-evolving nature of the virus high transmissibility host promiscuity suboptimal vaccine efficacy limited antiviral arsenal and zoonotic and pandemic potential are more than convincing factors to consider influenza viruses as attractive targets for drug repurposing despite many interesting omics-based approaches 76 or high-throughput screening of specific drug libraries such as kinase inhibitors 77 no anti-influenza agent issued from drug repurposing has yet reached regulatory market approval however advances made during the last years forecast optimism the following selected examples constitute a very good illustration of the diversity and capabilities of drug repurposing strategies for influenza infection an exhaustive list of anti-influenza candidates issued from drug repurposing approaches is presented in table 2 the case of statins is arguably the best-known example of anti-influenza repurposing issued from clinical observations in the early 2000s clinicians observed that besides the cardioprotective activity of statins these hydroxyl methylglutaryl-coenzyme a hmg-coa reductase inhibitors approved for their use as cholesterol metabolism regulators could have pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects which could be of benefit to improve survival of patients with severe influenza 7880 although many mouse and observational studies account for the protective role of statins in pneumonia most in vivo studies reported so far failed to clearly demonstrate such a beneficial effect in the specific context of influenza infection 99102 on the other hand a few but not all observational studies highlighted an association between statin treatment with up to 41 reduction of 30-day all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza 103105 a randomized placebo-controlled phase ii clinical trial nct02056340 aimed at evaluating the potential effect of atorvastatin to reduce the severity of illness in influenza-infected patients is currently undergoing nitazoxanide is another illustration of a serendipitous repurposing approach and probably one of the most promising examples nitazoxanide is a thiazolide anti-infective initially licensed for the treatment of parasitic infections for which anti-influenza properties were first documented by rossignol et al 81 interestingly the proposed mode of action of nitazoxanide toward influenza is clearly distinct to that for which it was designed in its initial indication acting at the post-translational level by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral glycoprotein ha with a consecutive impact on its intracellular trafficking and insertion into the host plasma membrane 81 106 this drug presents potent antiviral activity against a large panel of circulating strains 82 the effectiveness of nitazoxanide in treating patients with non-complicated influenza was successful in a phase iibiii trial 107 and is currently being assessed in a phase iii clinical trial nct01610245 bay81-8781lasag d l-lysine acetylsalicylate-glycine a modified version of the anti-inflammatory drug acetylsalicylic acid asa licensed for intravenous and inhalation delivery is currently investigated as an anti-influenza treatment as a result of a mixed serendipitous and target-based repurposing strategy it was initially shown that asa had interesting antiviral effects against influenza viruses in vitro and in vivo via the inhibition of the nf-kb activating kinase ikkb which negatively impacts influenza vrnp transport and release of infectious viral particles 108110 however due to the pharmacokinetic limitations of asa the lasag modified version with improved stability and tolerability was developed like asa this molecule also demonstrates antiviral activity against several human and avian influenza viruses in vitro in a mouse infection model inhalation of lasag resulted in reduced lung viral titers and protection of mice from lethal infection 85 more recently a phase ii proof-of-concept study comparing lasag versus placebo in patients with severe influenza all patients receiving tamiflu as standard of care treatment demonstrated that aerosolized lasag improved the time to symptom alleviation compared to placebo despite the absence of a statistically significant reduction of viral load in lasag-treated group 86 naproxen constitutes a nice example of in-silico  target-based strategy for the identification of new antivirals lejal et al used a structure-based modeling approach to identify drugs of interest directed against the nucleoprotein np of influenza a virus using the x-ray structure of the rna-free np of h1n1 as prototype an in-silico screening focused of a defined specific site of np structure has identified naproxen a known inhibitor of inducible cyclooxygenase type 2 cox-2 commonly used as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug this identified molecule has shown antiviral properties against influenza a virus in vitro and in vivo 94 more recently naproxen analogs with improved efficacy have been developed showing high level of inhibition of both np-rna and np-polymerase subunit pa complexes without parallel inhibition of cox-2 111 112 interestingly in contrast to other examples of drug repurposing strategies the example of naproxen remains virus-targeted and future works will determine if this drug will present the same achilles heel than classic antivirals regarding selection of antiviral resistance the last two examples of this chapter are midodrine and diltiazem that we identified as influenza antivirals in the context of an in-silico assisted strategy based on transcriptional profiling an emerging approach in drug repurposing is based on signature matching which consists of comparing a specific characteristic of a drugits cellular signatureto that of a disease 42 this approach mostly based on transcriptomic data was successfully exploited to identify drug repurposing opportunities in a large range of therapeutics areas and notably in the field of oncology and rare diseases 42 our group was the first to transpose this approach to the field of viral infectious diseases thanks to the development and democratization of dna-microarray and more recently rnaseq techniques in a proof-of-concept study using an in vitro model of infection we postulated that host global gene expression profiling can be considered as a fingerprint or signature of any specific cell state including during infection or drug treatment and hypothesized that the screening of databases for compounds that counteract virogenomic signatures could enable rapid identification of effective antivirals 97 among the molecules identified in silico midodrine an adrenergic alpha receptor agonist widely used to treat hypotension demonstrated very interesting in vitro antiviral activities 97 these results prompted the phase ii clinical evaluation of midodrine nct01546506 for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal flu in primary care centers based on this previous proof-of-concept obtained from in vitro gene expression profiles we further improved the strategy by analyzing upper respiratory tract clinical samples collected from a cohort of influenza ah1n1pdm09-infected patients and determined their respective transcriptomic signatures we then performed an in-silico drug screening and identified a list of candidate bioactive molecules with signatures anti-correlated with those of the patients acute infection state the potential antiviral properties of selected market-approved molecules were firstly validated in vitro and the most effective compounds were further compared to oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza ah1n1pdm09 virus infections in mice and in a physiological in vitro model of reconstituted human airway epithelia mucilair these results notably highlighted diltiazem a calcium channel blocker used as an anti-hypertensive drug as a very promising repurposed host-targeted inhibitor of influenza infection 98 an ongoing french multicenter randomized clinical trial is investigating the effect of diltiazem-oseltamivir bitherapy compared with standard oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of severe influenza infections in intensive care units flunext trial nct03212716 the concept of antiviral combination therapy was originally pioneered for antiretroviral treatments with the primary goal of preventing or at least delaying the emergence of drug resistance via the targeting of multiple steps of the viral cycle 113 another expected complementary goal is to obtain additive or synergistic effects by combining drugs a double-trigger effect to increase effectiveness andor reduce dosage in the context of influenza infections the combination of classic antivirals mostly na inhibitors was explored by several research groups including ours with relatively mixed conclusions for example in a mouse model the combination of oseltamivir with zanamivir was shown to be not superior to zanamivir monotherapy in the context of influenza ah3n2 or ah1n1pdm09 infection 114 a clinical trial was conducted during the ah1n1pdm09 pandemic in 2009-2010 combina trial nct00830323 and failed to demonstrate whether oseltamivirzanamivir combination therapy improved or reduced the effectiveness of oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza infections in community patients 115 other clinical investigations have shown a greater effectiveness of such combination therapy to reduce influenza transmissibility 116 as most alternative antiviral strategies for the treatment of influenza infections including those related to drug repurposing and targeting the host instead of viral determinants an emerging trend consists to propose innovative therapies that combine classic antivirals with host-targeting drugs which starts to show promising results 87 for example belardo et al have demonstrated in cell culture-based assays using different human and avian models that the combination of na inhibitors and nitazoxanide presents synergistic anti-influenza effects 117 convincing results were also obtained using a combination treatment including naproxen in a clinical trial enrolling hospitalized patients infected by influenza ah3n2 combination therapy with naproxen oseltamivir and clarithromycin showed improved efficacy in terms of hospital stay duration and patient mortality when compared to oseltamivir treatment alone 118 in the context of the evaluation of the antiviral activity of diltiazem in the reconstituted human airway epithelium model mucilair our group demonstrated that the diltiazem-oseltamivir combination treatment conferred a greater reduction of apical viral titers than that was measured with the same-dose monotherapy with a marked delay of viral production 98 an ongoing french multicenter randomized clinical trial is investigating the effect of diltiazem-oseltamivir bitherapy compared with standard oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of severe influenza infections in intensive care units flunext trial nct03212716 altogether these results plead in favor of the use of drug repurposing for the improvement of the current standard of care anti-influenza therapy in contrast to other technological domains the innovation is not necessary chasing and replacing the established standard and future works are still necessary to investigate the real impact of these novel host  virus-targeted multi-therapy approaches on the management and control of the emergence of viral resistance we do not need to find new drugs rather we need to find the patients who can benefit from existing drugs the saying goes although somehow exaggerated this statement summarizes pretty clearly the essence behind the drug repurposing initiative finding new indications for already-existing drugs has many benefits mainly by improving cost-effectiveness reducing risks and shortening time to market 37 41 the purpose of this review was to foster discussion on drug repurposing as an option to complete and implement our current anti-influenza therapeutic arsenal we are facing an important need for the development of novel antiviral strategies that improve treatment effectivenessespecially in the case of severe diseasesand that are less prone to selection for antiviral resistance in that regard the identification and validation by different and complementary means of repurposed drugs is incontestably of great interest notably in combination with current classic virus-targeted inhibitors in addition the deposition of data including negative results into public database should be encouraged as it would facilitate efforts to repurpose licensed or orphaned drugs and consecutively increase our chances to find new efficient antiviral drugs with a growing number of academic groups and pharmaceutical companies working on this emerging field we should most certainly see interesting progress and efficient novel anti-influenza therapies reaching regulatory market approval in a near future in the context of a globalized world facing major vicissitudes including population dynamics climate change and the multiple emergencere-emergence of zoonotic viruses the effectiveness and reaction force of the classic de novo development of antivirals is challenged despite inherent limits drug repurposing offers a

 it is reported that the food and drug administration fda has approved agents against about 400 human proteins 2 90 of which comes under the classification of enzymes transporters g protein-coupled receptors gpcrs cluster of differentiation cd markers voltage-gated ion channels and nuclear receptors it is a fact that the typical de novo drug discovery program takes 1015 years 34 from the identification of lead molecule to market the drug and the probability of success rate is less than 10 5 over five years the number of new drugs approved by fda has been around 40 per year although billions of us dollars spent by various pharma industries on the research and development 6 7 8 the success rate is less than 6 of new drug discovery and development which is far away from addressing an unmet clinical need for disease treatments because the effective therapeutics for complex diseases like alzheimers disease ad parkinsons disease pd cardiovascular diseases and neglected diseases are still lacking this outcome strongly suggests that new strategies approaches and technologies are needed to accelerate drug discovery to advance the success rate of drug development drug repurposing is a strategy consisting of finding new indications for already known marketed drugs used in various clinical settings or highly characterized compounds despite they can be failed drugs 9 it is a drug discovery program which is faster and safer to develop medications against diseasesdisorders for which no potential treatment is available in recent years the success rate of drug repurposing approach accounts for approximately 30 of the newly fda approved drugs and vaccines this is one of the main reasons for pharmaceutical companies to show their interest in drug repurposing approach this approach does not require the initial six to 10 years typically needed for the development of new drugs additionally many phases of de novo drug discovery and development can be by-passed since clinical and pre-clinical studies of the re-purposed candidates are already being documented in the original indications thus it reduces the time and cost needed to reach the market and risk intrinsic to any research and development program moreover the risk of clinical failure is also low as an added advantage this approach gives a possibility to widen the market and to prolong the application of the patent life of a drug there are mainly two ways to proceed drug-repositioning approach such as experimental strategies and computational strategies experimental repurposing strategies include binding assays and phenotypic screening methods which can be to find binding interactions of drug molecules to assay components and to identify lead compounds from a vide range of compound libraries respectively 10 computational approaches are categorized into target-mechanism based knowledge-based pathway- and network-based approaches these approaches are proven economic in discovering novel therapeutic ligands most notably computational methods augment the drug discovery process by effectively utilizing cheminformatics bioinformatics network biology and systems biology more specifically these methods exploit known targets drugs disease biomarkers or pathways to establish novel methods and accelerate the planning of crucial clinical trials 11 in this perspective we focused on the status of drugs repurposing approaches for various diseases including skin diseases infective inflammatory cancer and neurodegenerative diseases efforts have been made to provide structural features and modes of action of drugs which are exclusively small molecules peptidomimetics and macrocyclic compounds antibodies vaccines and any other biological drugs are not discussed 
drugs repositioning for skin whitening activity melanin is a collection of natural pigments that primarily determine the skin hair and hair color of the human melanocytes which are found in the basal layer of the epidermis produce melanin by the process called melanogenesis upon the skin exposure to the ultra-violet uv-radiation 1213 although melanin protects human skin from the radiation continuing irradiation can result in the risk of skin damage and malignant melanoma a cancer of melanocytes besides the abnormal production of melanin leads to a serious of dermatological disorders including melasma 13 14 15 16 freckles age spots and post-inflammatory melanoderma 1517 melanogenesis a process of synthesis of melanin is a complex enzymatic and biochemical catalyzed reactions in which tyrosinase plays a rate-limiting step hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to l-34-dihydroxyphenylalanine l-dopa followed by the oxidation of l-dopa to l-dopaquinone which serves as a substrate for the production of melanin 18 therefore targeting tyrosinase has been recognized as a potential approach for controlling the abnormal production of melanin tyrosinase is also an important target in the food industry as inhibition of tyrosinase can prevent the enzymatic browning of fruits and vegetables besides it essential for wound healing process and immune responses in many plants sponges and some invertebrates abnormal activities of tyrosinase have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders including parkinsons 19 and huntingtons diseases 20 21 22 23 24 
thiourea and analogs tyrosinase inhibitors can be broadly classified into two categories a polyphenols which are mostly natural products such as arbutin hydroquinone and kojic acids and b thiourea and its derivatives since the 1940s phenylthiourea ptu 1 has been well known as a tyrosinase inhibitor 2526 many research groups including ours have extensively studied the structure-activity relationships for ptu as tyrosinase inhibitors 2728 choi et al screened the fda approved drug library that has closed structural similarity to ptu see fig 1
 29 for example ethionamide 2 a second-line antituberculosis drug used for the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis shares a chemical similarity that led to the discovery of a new mushroom tyrosinase inhibitor with an ic50 value of 40 m other commercially available analogs of 2 including prothionamide 3 thioisonicotinamide 4 pyridine-3-carbothiomide 5 pyridine-2-carbothiomide 6 and thiobenzamide 7 were identified as potent tyrosinase inhibitors in particular compound 7 had a strong inhibitory activity than other molecules which suggests that the pyridine ring in compound 2 can be replaced by other aromatic moieties including a benzene ring however the poor inhibitory activity of isoniazid 8 a first-line antituberculosis drug suggests that carbothiomide group was crucial for tyrosinase inhibitory activity moreover comparing the inhibitory activities of drugs 2 and 3 implies that the additional aliphatic tail was not required for inhibiting the tyrosinase inhibitory kinetic studies suggest that drug 2 and its analogs 37 were reversible and non-competitive in cellular assay drugs 6 and 7 markedly decreased the melanin content in b16 cells to the values of 44 and 37 respectively without inducing any cytotoxicity up to 50 m concentration further studies suggest that the drug 7 had strong inhibition of mammalian tyrosinase however the inhibition exhibited by drug 2 and its analogs were weaker than those obtained by ptu observed in enzyme and melanin content assays the same research group continued to search for molecules that are in clinical usage and contain thiourea moiety 30 as a result they could retrieve some thiourea containing drugs such as thioacetazone 9 ambazone 10 methimazole 11 carbimazole 12 thiouracil 13 methylthiouracil 14 and propylthiouracil 15 thioacetazone 9 also called as thiacetazone is an anti-tuberculosis drug 31 ambazone 10 is an oral antiseptic drug used in europe 32 the other five molecules 1115 are antithyroid drugs 33 these drugs except 12 exhibited remarkable inhibitory activities against mushroom tyrosinase see ic50 values of each in fig 1 although they were comparatively weaker than 1 1 m kinetics studies of tyrosinase inhibition assigned these thiourea-containing drugs as non-competitive inhibitors in cellular assay using b16 cells drug 10 among other thioureas significantly decreased the melanin content by 20 without inducing any cytotoxicity up to 20 m further enzymatic studies with cell extracts of b16f10 cells confirmed that thiourea-containing drugs affected the function of mammalian tyrosinase in an extended study the same group repositioned thiopurine drugs 1619 as tyrosinase inhibitors 34 thioguanine 16 a drug used for the treatment of leukemia is one of the essential medicines required for a basic health system recommended by the world health organization who it inhibited tyrosinase activity with a ki value of 52 m in addition to that two other thiopurine drugs such as mercaptopurine 17 and azathioprine 18 were discovered as tyrosinase inhibitors and among them drug 17 showed stronger ki value ki 52 m than the drug 16 azathioprine 18 exhibited a poor tyrosinase inhibition these results suggest that the sulfur atom possibly plays an important role in the interaction of tyrosinase interestingly thioinosine 19 a metabolic product of mercaptopurine through the attachment of sugar moiety exhibited an excellent tyrosinase inhibitory activity with a ki value of 80 m further kinetics studies classified the drugs 16 17 and 19 as competitive inhibitors in the cellular assay these drugs inhibited the melanin content without cytotoxicity up to 50 m in particular drug 16 at 50-m concentration remarkably reduced the melanin content by 57 without any apparent cytotoxicity the thiopurine drugs were docked into four different crystal structures complexed with inhibitors tropolone kojic acid hydroquinone and ptu fig 2
 35 36 37 in the molecular docking study thiopurine moieties of drugs 16 17 and 19 exhibited an almost similar pattern of binding mode to that of ptu thioinsoine 19 fig 2 d made additional contacts with the side-chains of n-260 f-264 and v-283 that were thought to have the stronger inhibition it also predicted that the intramolecular hydrophilic contacts with the residue of e-256 disappeared in mercaptopurine fig 2c whereas thioguanine fig 2b and thioinosine possess the contacts within 38  
drugs repositioning for cancer therapy as cancer is one of the leading cause of death worldwide 38 pharmaceutical companies invest billions of dollars in developing new anti-cancer drugs the drug discovery and development process for the cancer treatment takes an average of 13 years at a cost of approximately  18 billion 39 however only 5 of the drugs that enter clinical trials are approved this prolonged duration for the drug development and enormous cost of the preclinical trials for their approval emphasizes the need for a drug repurposing approach see fig 3
for drugs repurposing in cancer therapy aspirin 20 also known as acetylsalicylic acid is one of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids which has been widely used as an analgesic and an antipyretic to prevent the heart attack and stroke for the first time gasic and co-workers reported the possible role of aspirin in cancer therapy they discovered that the antiplatelet activity of 20 in tumor-bearing mice was associated with a 50 reduction in lung metastasis 40 a recent study also indicated that the daily intake of the drug 20 75 mg produced a significant beneficial effect against gastrointestinal esophageal pancreatic brain prostate and lung cancer 41 the mode of action aspirin is reported to modulate numerous molecules which are associated with the tumorigenesis process 42 preclinical studies revealed that the anticancer activity of drug 20 has been attributed by its inhibition of cyclooxygenase cox enzymes that promotes carcinogenesis through the synthesis of prostaglandins pg including pge2 43 besides drug 20 was reported to inhibit the activation of transcription factor nf-b which is critical to regulating the expression of genes involved in apoptosis 44 in a study reported by li ling et al compound 20 not only inhibited proliferations and promoted apoptosis of cancer cells but also delayed and overcame acquired resistance to targeted therapy the underlying mechanism could be attributed to enhanced cancer stemness and activated nf-kb signaling in acquired resistant tumors were suppressed by aspirin and rendered resistant tumors more sensitive to aspirin than parental sensitive cells in terms of proliferation apoptosis and cancer stemness on the contrary aspirin has no effects on normal lung and mammary epithelial cell proliferation at concentrations used on lung and breast cancer cells hence aspirin could be a potential candidate for combination therapy for lung and breast cancers 45 other studies suggest that the anticancer property of aspirin 20 has been linked to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pi3k pathway and ras-raf-mek-erk signaling cascade while numerous studies suggest the potent anticancer activities of drug 20 the overall benefit is limited as it is associated with serious side effects including the gastrointestinal and renal toxicities therefore there is no clear recommendation to take 20 for population-wide use on the other hand as a primary cancer prevention tool many reports revealed using 20 would have a greater benefit in the population at age 4085 thus us preventive services task force recommendation statement uspstf recommended for daily intake of 20 for patients above 40 years with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer celecoxib 21 belongs to the family of nsaid which has been used to treat pain and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis ra and osteoarthritis oa 46 in 1999 the fda approved celecoxib which is a highly selective reversible inhibitor of cox-2 a well-known inflammatory cancer target because of its cox-2 inhibitory activity the antitumor activities of drug 21 have been extensively studied and shown to have chemopreventive activities against various cancer types other than cox-2 celecoxib targets glycogen synthase kinase gsk 3 -catenin nf-b akt8 virus oncogene cellular homolog akt and b cell lymphoma bcl-2 families 47 in people with familial adenomatous polyposis fap a daily dosage of drug 21 400 mg significantly reduced the risk of colorectal adenomas fda approved this compound to reduce colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis 48 however it was associated with some drawbacks including gastrointestinal renal and cardiotoxic effects ibuprofen 22 is an nsaid which has been primarily used to treat fever pain and inflammation at the molecular level ibuprofen inhibits cox which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin however it is not selective towards any isoform of cox the drug was marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the united kingdom 1969 and in the united states 1971 as well the anticancer activity of drug 22 has been investigated in various cancer cell types ibuprofen has been shown to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells 49 in adenocarcinoma gastric cells drug 22 showed antitumor effects which have been mediated by the anti-angiogenesis induction of apoptosis and reduction of cell proliferation 50 the administration of drug 22 induces apoptosis in metastatic melanoma cell lines 51 ibuprofen also reported to increases the chemosensitivity of cisplatin by decreasing the levels of heat shock protein 70s hsp70s in lung cancer cells hsp70s are an important part of the cells machinery for protein folding and their function was associated with resistance to apoptosis 52 therefore by blocking hsp70s ibuprofen increased the apoptosis by increasing the sensitivity of cisplatin thalidomide 23 is an immunomodulatory drug which was originally developed as a sedative-hypnotic for the treatment of nausea during pregnancy however it was withdrawn due to its teratogenic effects the drug was demonstrated whether it could be used for treating patients with refractory myeloma because of its anti-angiogenic activity after successful clinical evaluations fda approved the drug 23 for treating multiple myeloma additionally molecule 23 also showed efficacy against several malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia 53 myelodysplasia 54 and myelodysplastic syndrome 55 mechanistically thalidomide binds to cereblon which forms an e3 ubiquitin ligase complex resulting in the rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of transcription factors ikaros and aiolos 56 these two transcription factors are transcriptional regulators of b and t cell development 57 metformin 24 is an orally available first-line drug and has been widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes the molecular mechanism of metformin involves the activation of adenosine monophosphate amp-induced protein kinase ampk a key enzyme regulating cellular metabolism rapamycin mtor a gene that is involved in the survival of cancer cells is negatively regulated by ampk metformin is also able to reduce the signals of mtor by inhibiting rag-mediated activation of mtor 58 in general diabetic patients have an increased risk of several cancer types especially diabetic women have a 20 risk of developing breast cancer several studies suggested the anticancer property of drug 24 the drug 24 at the dose of 250500 mgday has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer as well as its daily dose reduces the incidence of gastrological cancer in patients with diabetes 5960 several reviews and meta-analysis suggests that taking drug 24 was associated with reduced risk of all cancer mortality in patients with diabetes 61 in a recent meta-analysis of several anti-diabetic drugs it was found that the patients using drug 24 had an overall reduced risk of cancer and decreased mortality rate by 14 and 30 respectively whereas the use of insulin was associated with an increased risk of cancer and mortality the recent phase 3 clinical trial studies using the occurrence of colorectal adenomas as a biomarker for cancer as a primary endpoint at 1 year after intervention revealed that metformin reduced both occurrence and number of adenomaspolyps in the patients at low dosage level methotrexate 25 is a competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase dhfr a critical enzyme that involved in the synthesis of dna rna thymidylates and proteins the hydrofolate inhibitory activity of drug 25 was responsible for its anti-leukemia activity besides drug 25 was effective against a wide range of malignancies including breast head and neck leukemia lymphoma lung osteosarcoma bladder and trophoblastic neoplasms 62 fda approved this compound in 1988 for the treatment of osteosarcoma breast cancer acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hodgkin lymphoma several reports suggest that the antitumor activity of methotrexate is also due to its ability to target inflammatory pathways for instance methotrexate was reported to suppress the nf-b through the release of adenosine in cancer cells 63 rapamycin 26 also known as sirolimus which was originally developed as an anti-fungal agent however drug 26 was withdrawn due to its potent immunosuppressant and antitumor activities mechanistically the drug inhibits t cells and b cells by decreasing their sensitivity to il-2 through inhibition of mtor which is highly upregulated in many tumor cells 64 in the year 1999 fda approved rapamycin for the prevention of allograft rejection after that this drug has been investigated for its anticancer properties in recent studies drug 26 was reported to reduce the colony formation of leukemia progenitor cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia 64 in addition to that drug 26 also showed efficacious in patients with imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia through the suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor vegf mrna levels in leukemia cells with mild side effects 65 diclofenac 27 is an acetic acid derivative of nsaid class which has been used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout its mode of action was believed to suppress the production of prostaglandin through inhibition of both cox-1 and cox-2 the drug came into use in the year 1988 in the us the anticancer activity of drug 27 has been reported in several cancer types including hepatoma colon and fibrosarcoma pancreatic and ovarian cancer in rat models of fibrosarcoma and hepatoma the drug 27 significantly reduced the growth rate and the level of vascularization 66 the drug 27 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on human colon cancer cell lines 67 the tumor inhibitory activity of drug 27 was also proved in ovarian cancer 68 at the molecular level diclofenac induces apoptosis through inhibition of antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 sod 2 leading to increased levels of reactive oxygen species 69 recent phase ii clinical trial study of diclofenac for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma concluded that topical application of diclofenac was highly effective in tumor regression with 64 7071 naproxen 28 is a member of the propionic acid family of nsaid class which has been used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and fever this drug works by non-selectively inhibiting both cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes which results in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in 1976 the drug was marketed in the usa for its medical use recently the drug 28 has been repurposed for its anticancer activity as it was shown to inhibit cell proliferation induce apoptosis and suppress metastasis in various cancer cell types in vitro studies of drug 28 in human urinary bladder cancer cell lines showed that it induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis through targeting pi3k 72 the combination of atorvastatin and naproxen significantly inhibited the colonic adenocarcinomas in vivo in animals 73 in the phase ii clinical trial it has been investigated in combination with calcitriol for recurrent prostate cancer the results showed that the combination was well tolerated statin family of drugs are lipid-lowering agents that inhibit the rate-limiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a hmg-coa reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway statins are commonly prescribed to reduce cholesterol synthesis in patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease in addition to that statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway that provides mevalonate farnesyl and geranyl pyrophosphate these molecules are important for the cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and therefore statins represent promising candidates in cancer therapeutics in chronic myeloid leukemia cells simvastatin 29 74 and other natural statins including mevastatin 30 lovastatin 31 and pravastatin 32 displayed tnf-induced apoptosis through the downregulation of nf-b mediated anti-apoptotic gene products 75 the anti-cancer activity of statins was also investigated in animal studies in which statins were effective in reducing the incidence and growth of tumors 76 several observational studies and meta-analysis supports the positive correlation of using statins with their chemopreventive effect in humans meta-analyses revealed that the use of statins reduced the risk of patients with gastric cancer 77 as well as esophageal 78 and hepatocarcinoma cancer types 79 in a case-control study drug 29 with a dosage of 40 mgday for 25 years significantly reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer 80 depakine 33 or valproic acid vpa is a short-chain free fatty acid mainly used to treat epilepsy bipolar disorders and migraine its anticonvulsant activity has been attributed to the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and increased levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba in the brain anti-cancer activity of drug 33 was first established in leukemia cells in which the drug 33 was shown to inhibit histone deacetylase hdac 81 depakine has also been found to suppress the production of cytokine and to modulate inflammatory signaling cascade in human leukemia and human glioma cells drug 33 was able to suppress the production of il-6 and tnf- 82 in prostate cancer cells drug 33 suppressed the il-6 through inhibition of nf-b activity 83 some of the clinical trials of drug 33 have advanced to phase ii for sarcomas thyroid cancers acute myelogenous leukemia b cell lymphoma breast cancer melanoma non-small and small-cell lung cancers prostate cancer recurrent glioblastoma and relapsedrefractory leukemia wwwclinicaltrialsgov recently abdullah et al 84 has shown that pitavastatin 34 has potential to treat ovarian cancer if dietary geranylgeraniol is controlled however relatively high doses of statins are required to induce apoptosis in cancer cells increasing the risk of myopathy the most common adverse efect associated with statins this makes it desirable to identify drugs which reduce the dose of pitavastatin necessary to treat cancer a drug-repositioning strategy was employed to identify suitable candidates screening a custom library of 100 of-patent drugs for synergistic activity with pitavastatin identifed prednisolone 35 as the most prominent hit prednisolone potentiated the activity of pitavastatin in several assays measuring the growth survival or apoptosis in several ovarian cancer cells lines prednisolone alone or in some cases in combination with pitavastatin reduced the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the mevalonate pathway providing a mechanistic explanation for the synergy pitavastatin inhibited the growth of tested cell lines with an ic50 ranging from 11 to 48 m therefore clinical trials of prednisolone with pitavastatin in patients with ovarian cancer may be highly warranted in case of triple-negative breast cancer tnbc and several other cancers wnt signaling is overactivated and hence its suppression emerges as an effective anticancer treatment however no drugs targeting the wnt pathway exist on the market nor in advanced clinical trials very recently ahmed et al have provided a comprehensive body of preclinical evidence that an anti-leprotic drug clofazimine 36 is effective against tnbc 85 clofazimine specifically inhibits canonical wnt signaling in a panel of tnbc cells in vitro for example an ic50 of 6 m and 7 m was exhibited in hek293t and bt-20 cells respectively in several mouse xenograft models of tnbc clofazimine efficiently suppresses tumor growth correlating with in vivo inhibition of the wnt pathway in the tumors clofazimine is well compatible with doxorubicin exerting additive effects on tumor growth suppression producing no adverse effects its excellent and well-characterized pharmacokinetics profile lack of serious adverse effects at moderate yet therapeutically effective doses its combinability with cytotoxic therapeutics and the novel mechanistic mode of action make clofazimine a prime candidate for the repositioning clinical trials our work may bring forward the anti-wnt targeted therapy desperately needed for thousands of patients currently lacking targeted treatments multiple myeloma mm also known as plasma cell myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells is an incurable hematological malignancy driven by several genetic and epigenetic alterations this mm is associated with a variety of genetic and epigenetic events namely aberrant dna methylation histone modifications including methylation acetylation ubiquitylation and phosphorylation actin and non-coding rna expression as well as deregulation of various signaling pathways that regulate dna repair rna editing protein homeostasis these epigenetic events have been associated with abnormal signaling by dysregulation of critical pathways controlling cell cycle apoptosis and drug resistance catalano raffaella et al recently reported anti-tumor activity of hydroxychloroquine 37 derivative of chloroquine and an anti-malarial agent also known as autophagy inhibitor they demonstrated that 37 inhibits the allosteric binding of polycomb repressive complex 2 prc2 to catalytic subunit eed within the lysine 27 of histone h3 h3k27me3 binding pocket and thereby antagonizing the prc2 catalytic activity 86 treatment for acute myeloid leukemia aml has not significantly changed in the last decades and new therapeutic approaches are needed to achieve prolonged survival rates 87 bromocriptine 38 is an ergoline derivative and dopamine agonist that is used in the treatment of parkinsons disease acromegaly hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhoea and recently repositioned for diabetes mellitus 8889 repurposing strategy handled by lara-castillo mara carmen et al has shown bromocriptine as a potent anti-leukemia drug that mainly targets leukemia stem cells 90 treatment with 38 reduced cell viability of aml cells by activation of the apoptosis program and induction of myeloid differentiation moreover the lsc-enriched primitive aml cell fraction was more sensitive to the presence of bromocriptine in fact bromocriptine decreased the clonogenic capacity of aml cells interestingly a negligible effect is observed in healthy blood cells and hematopoietic stemprogenitor cells the results support the use of bromocriptine as an anti-aml drug in a repositioning setting and the further clinical validation 
drugs repositioning for infectious diseases severe-acute respiratory syndrome sars is an atypical form of pneumonia which is caused by a human coronavirus cov called sars-cov the major outbreak was happened in 2003 and it affected more than 800 cases across three continents with a mortality rate of about 10 91 92 93 94 in 2012 a novel human coronavirus called middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was discovered which was associated with severe respiratory tract infection acute kidney injury and coagulopathy the major outbreak was happened in the republic of korea in the year 2015 as of july 2015 this virus infected around 1401 people of which 543 39 was died 95 96 97 typically the drug-discovery program to develop new potent anti-viral agents and to obtain approval for clinical use takes more than 10 years until now no effective vaccines or drugs are approved treat these infections although many are in preclinical development hence the drugs that have been used for the treatment of other diseases or disorders that may inhibit the replication of coronaviruses covs might be useful in an attempt to save the life of several affected patients in a search of potential anti-viral agents against mers-cov de wilde et al identified four drugs such as chloroquine 39 chlorpromazine 40 loperamide 41 and lopinavir 42 from the screening of fda approved drugs library fig 4
 98 they all were able to inhibit the replication of mers-cov in the low micromolar range in addition to that all four drugs inhibited sars-cov as well as human coronavirus hcov-229e which suggests that they could be used for broad-spectral anti-viral activity as a mode of action drug 39 inhibited the replication of mers-cov in a dose-dependent manner with an ec50 value of 30 m through the blockade of the virus at a very early stage chloroquine was previously reported as an effective anti-viral agent against flavivirus influenza virus hiv 99 ebola virus 100 and nipha-hendra virus 101 chlorpromazine 40 was another hit compound resulted from the screening and inhibited the replication of mers-cov with an ec50 of 49 m it is the first antipsychotic drug developed for the treatment of schizophrenia 102 and mechanistically it inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis it has also been reported to inhibit the replication of hepatic c virus hcv 103 alphavirus 104 mouse hepatitis virus mhv-2 105 and another coronavirus sars-cov 106 the mechanistic study of drug 40 on mers-cov indicated that it inhibited the virus at both an early and postentry stage suggesting that an effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not only the sole antiviral mechanism loperamide 41 an antidiarrheal opioid receptor agonist which reduces the intestinal motility 107 inhibited the replication of mers-cov additionally it inhibited the other two coronaviruses in low micromolar range 46 m lopinavir 42 is an anti-hiv protease inhibitor which also inhibited the replication of mers-cov with an ec50 of 80 m it was previously reported to inhibit the sars-cov main protease mpro 108 and therefore it was presumed that it might also target the mpro of mers-cov current anti-mers-cov agents have been primarily resulted from previous drugs used for the sars-cov infection to identify potential antiviral agents against mers-cov shin et al screened a library consisting of 2334 approved drugs and pharmaceutically active compounds 109 this yielded a series of hit compounds primarily categorized as anticancer 4142 antipsychotics 43 antidepressent 44 and antipsychotic 45 with inhibitory activity ranging from 21 to 144 m fig 4 among them saracatinib 46 was particularly important as it showed an excellent anti-mers-cov activity with an ec50 of 29 m and a cc50  50 m saracatinib 46 is an orally available small molecule drug used for the treatment of tumor malignancies through the inhibition of src-family tyrosine kinases sfks it also inhibited other coronaviruses sars-cov ec50 24 m and hcov-229e ec50 51 m and feline infectious peritonitis fipv ec50 70 m within a not-toxic range of concentration an in vitro study of the anti-viral effect of the drug 46 had found to inhibit the early stages of mers-cov life cycle in huh-7 cells through a possible suppression of sfk signaling pathways interestingly co-treatment of the drug 46 with gemcitabine a deoxycytidine analog that is commonly used for the treatment of cancers 110111 showed a synergistic anti-viral effect with a minimal cytotoxic effect this supports the hypothesis of using them in a combination therapy to treat cov diseases 
drugs repurposed against dengue virus infection dengue fever is a life-threatening disease caused by four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes it became a global burden which causes approximately 390 million infections each year of which around 10000 to 20000 people die even though a vaccine against dengue is available its long-term protective action against each of the serotypes of dengue virus remains yet to be determined besides currently no clinically approved antiviral therapy is available to combat this virus among the many approaches applied to identify novel drugs for dengue fever drug repurposing gained much attention to the scientific community several antiviral antimalarial antidiabetic antihistamine anticancer antipsychotic antiparasite and anticholesteremic drugs have been repurposed to combat dengue virus infection a recent publication by botta et al discussed each class of drugs and its repositioning in detail 112 to identify novel and potent drug candidates approved drugs such as lovastatin 31 chloroquine 39 prednisolone 51 balapiravir 52 and celgosivir 53 were investigated for the proof-off concept clinical trials for dengue viral infection fig 5
 although the results showed that they were safe in patients with acute dengue drugs failed to meet priordefined trial endpoints 112 113 114 115 116 besides two clinical trials conducted in thailand and singapore involving ivermectin 54 and ketotifen 55 the preliminary result was quite promising as phase 2 study of the drug 54 suggested a reduction in serum ns1 levels and body temperature 117 recently malakar et al screened various classes of fda approved drugs including aminolevulinic acid 56 azelaic acid 57 mitoxantrone hydrochloride 58 quinine sulfate 59 and tested their ability to inhibit dengue virus denv replication 118119 aminolevulinic acid 56 an endogenous non-proteinogenic amino acid and azelaic acid 57 are used to treat skin diseases 120121 while mitoxantrone hydrochloride 58 an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent used for the treatment of leukemia 122 quinine sulfate 59 is a natural compound extracted from cinchona bark which is commercially available in 324-mg tablets under the brand name qualaquin it has been widely used to treat chloroquine-resistant plasmodium falciparum 123 its ability to reduce the viral replication was also demonstrated against herpes simplex virus hsv 124 and influenza virus 125 among these four drugs investigated the drug 59 was found to be very effective in inhibiting the replication of denv by about 80 compared to untreated controls while the others showed only moderate reduction of about 50 it was very impressive that drug 59 was able to reduce virus replication of all four serotypes of denv in three different cell lines of human origin at the molecular level it inhibited denv replication by reducing viral protein and rna synthesis in a dose-dependent manner moreover drug 59 enhanced the expression of genes related to innate immune response these findings suggest that the efficacy of drug 59 for stimulating antiviral genes which led to reduce denv replication 
repurposing on malarial infection malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by protozoan plasmodium parasites in 2017 it was estimated that approximately 219 million people were affected by malarial infections of which 435000 died 126 huge efforts have been taken to prevent or cure malaria over the decades and as a result the mortality rates are reduced to 60 nevertheless it continues to be a big problem around the world although several drugs including quinine and quinoline derivatives 127128 could moderately treat the infection the emergence of drug-resistant strains of plasmodium falciparum makes it more challenging in malaria treatment therefore the discovery and development of new antimalarial agents with a different mechanism of action that may not only reduce mortality and morbidity of the disease but also reduce the risk of resistance to existing antimalarial drugs are highly required to identify potential drug candidates two groups 129 130 131 conducted drug-repositioning approach of fda approved drugs chong et al screened around 189 drug molecules at 10 m concentration against blood-stage p falciparum derbyshire et al analyzed 37 drugs in a liver-stage p berghei model out of tested 226 drug molecules 18 were selected as highly potent candidates with an ic50 value of 25 m see fig 6
 129 it is interesting to note that out of 18 drugs four including clemastine fumarate 60 loperamide hydrochloride 36 omeprazole 61 and esomeprazole magnesium 62 are the over-the-counter otc drugs which can be easily accessed by patients in high-risk areas while other 14 drugs can be obtained via prescription only clemastine 60 an ethanolamine derivative is a first-generation h1 antagonist antihistamine associated with anticholinergic properties this drug came into use in the year 1967 to prevent hay fever and allergy symptoms loperamide 41 is a medication used to decrease the frequency of diarrhea both drugs 41 and 59 were effective against blood-stage pfalciparum with ic50 values of 22 m and 029 m respectively omeprazole and esomeprazole are used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease peptic ulcer and zollinger-ellison syndrome they were tested against liver-stage pberghei and showed ic50 values  2 m make them potential lead for the development of novel anti-malarial agents these all four otc drugs are orally administered which has the advantageous to develop as anti-malarial therapy from another set of prescribed drug candidates 6370 were tested against blood-stage p falciparum cultures fig 6

drug repurposed on neurodegenerative diseases in general neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsons disease pd alzheimers disease ad and huntingtons disease hd occurs because of several neurodegenerative processes 
drug repositioned on alzheimers disease ad dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life memory loss is an example alzheimers is the most common type of dementia it affects around 5 of people over the age of 65 20 over the age of 80 and more than a third of those over the age of 90 136 in the year 2015 there were approximately 298 million people worldwide with ad of which dementia resulted in about 19 million deaths it is estimated that there will be more than 115 million people with dementia worldwide by 2050 therefore ad represents a major and rising public health concern and there is an urgent need to develop more therapies that are effective ad refers to a devastating condition leading to progressive cognitive decline functional impairment and loss of independence accumulation of amyloid- peptide a-enriched neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles synaptic and neuronal dysfunction as well as loss in combination with the associated neurochemical changes in the brain are the crucial pathological event for ad 137 recent work suggests that higher levels of total tau may potentiate the toxic effects of a 138 other factors such as inflammatory processes and mitochondrial function are also likely to have an important role 139 three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil 76 rivastigmine 77 and galanthamine 78 fig 7
 are approved for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate ad memantine an nmda n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist is approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ad meta-analyses and cost-effectiveness evaluations have demonstrated that this repurposing confer moderate symptomatic benefits and are cost-effective 140 for example acetylcholinesterase inhibitors improve cognition to above pre-treatment performance for 612 months the availability of these drugs has substantially advanced the treatment of patients with ad but there is a persistent need to build on our increasing understanding of disease pathogenesis to develop more effective symptomatic treatments and disease-modifying therapies current study carried out by hassan et al 141 utilized both computational and enzyme inhibitory experimental kinetic approaches to evaluate the repositioning of known fda approved drugs for ad the computational shaped-based virtual screening results showed that from 1516 fda approved drugs 36 displayed good structural similarity with standard template donepezil moreover docking profile and pharmacogenomics evaluations depicted that out of 36 only five drugs were most active and showed good results compared to other drugs the md simulation results exposed that these five drugs risperidone domperidone verapamil tamsulosin and cinitapride showed better profiles with respect to their rmsd rmsf sasa and rg evaluations graphs and steady stable behavior in all docking complexes in-vitro ache inhibition assay of the above best-screened drugs were performed by spectrophotometric method using acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate the enzyme inhibition and kinetic mechanism of these drugs showed that cinitapride 79 has good therapeutic potential with respect to standard and other drugs it is well known that cintapride 79 is a gastroprokinetic agent and antiulcer agent of the benzamide class 142 it is an agonist of 5-ht1 and 5-ht4 receptors and as an antagonist of the 5-ht2 receptors 143 based on aforementioned results it is justified that cinitapride has better repositioning profile which may be used in the treatment of ad after clinical assessment efforts to develop more effective therapies have so far been unsuccessful with several high-profile clinical trial fails to demonstrate the benefit the reasons for this are probably multifactorial the majority of putative disease-modifying therapies that have been evaluated have targeted amyloid pathology this lack of breadth in treatment approaches has been criticized and some commentators have argued that a more sophisticated knowledge of disease pathways is needed before we can develop more effective candidate therapies for example phase ii trial of tarenflurbil 80 fig 7 only provided a suggestion of benefit in a posthoc subgroup analysis 144145 the putative mechanism of action via -secretase modulation and its related impact on amyloid pathology was never confirmed in patients with ad subsequent phase iii trial had negative outcomes although the results of a phase ii trial of dimebon 81 were much more favorable than of analog 80 fig 7 it seems that the significant benefit seen in the treatment group was driven by a larger-than-expected deterioration in the group receiving placebo treatment and the mechanism of action was not well characterized in the central nervous system cns angiotensin ii mediates key processes including the release of inflammatory mediators vasoconstriction mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of acetylcholine release at central synapses all of which are proposed to be relevant to ad and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention 146147 based on this background it has been proposed that angiotensin receptor blockers arbs may confer symptomatic benefits on cognition a large-scale screen of 55 antihypertensive drugs by want et al 148 identified the arb valsartan 82 fig 7 as the only compound that was able to reduce a accumulation in cultured neurons and inhibit a aggregation in vitro the same group was demonstrated that the reduced plaque burden as well as the improved learning and memory in cognitive tests including the morris water maze task following 5 months of treatment with valsartan in 6-month-old tg2576 transgenic mice as a result the greatest benefits were seen at a dose of 40 mgkgday which is equivalent to 15 times the maximum recommended dose for treating patients with hypertension using another arb olmesartan 83 fig 7 by takeda et al 149 demonstrated that daily treatment of young app23 mice for one month improved cerebral blood flow without affecting a1-40 and a1-42 levels in the a1-40-injected mouse model in which a fragments are injected intracranially to generate deficits pre-treatment with telmisartan 84 fig 7 increased cerebral blood flow and inhibited the plaque deposition 150 however the physiological relevance of this model is unclear perhaps the most striking preclinical evidence comes from a study in which losartan 85 fig 7 was administered intranasally to apppsen1 mice at a dose much lower than that mediating hypotensive effects drug 80 led to a 37-fold reduction in a plaques compared to vehicle-treated mice but also reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory mediator il-10 in the serum of these animals 151152 overall there was significant reduction in the incidence of dementia in patients taking arbs compared to those taking the comparator cardiovascular drugs hazard ratio 076 95 confidence interval 069084 and those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitor lisinopril hazard ratio 081 95 confidence interval 073090 although the evidence for the potential of arbs in ad is conflicting and difficult to interpret in our view there is a sufficient indication of potential benefit to merit further in vivo work to clarify the relative importance of different mechanisms the optimal dose and the optimal agent which could lead to proof-of-concept study in patients with ad the best evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies points to either drug 85 or 84 as a preferred arb with some animal studies also highlighting drug 83 as a potential candidate however there is an unfortunate disconnect between in vivo and clinical studies as no formal studies to provide direct clinical evidence have so far been conducted on any of the most promising candidates calcium channel blockers ccbs of the dihydropyridine class are widely used to treat hypertension and angina through their vasodilatory activity on smooth muscle vasculature most of the drugs in this class have good blood-brain barrier penetration and induces cerebral vasodilatation increased cerebral blood flow in animals and humans 153 in vitro studies have revealed that certain ccbs reduce a production oligomerization and accumulation rescue a-induced neurotoxicity and improve cell survival in the presence of a 154 155 156 ccbs have also been shown to reduce glutamate-induced cell death and levels of intracellular calcium 157 the ability of ccbs to prevent a1-40 and a1-42 production was investigated in chinese hamster ovary cells cho by paris et al and iwasaki et al in that study amlodipine 86 and nilvadipine 87 fig 7 were identified as the only agents that inhibited a production 158 however the concentrations studied were several-fold higher than can be achieved therapeutically isradipine 88 fig 7 was shown to have a neuroprotective effect against a-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma mg65 cell lines a protective effect in a drosophila melanogaster model of a-induced neurotoxicity and its brain-penetrant in the 3xtg-ad mouse model of ad was also reported 156159 the differential effects of ccbs indicate that their potential benefits in ad are probably independent of their anti-hypertensive activity and may be specific to individual drugs within this class dihydropyridines seem to be more effective than compounds with different chemical structures such as verapamil or diltiazem with evidence from preclinical studies that highlighted nilvadipine 87 as the best therapeutic candidate there was some clinical evidence regarding the potential benefit of the ccb nimodipine 89 fig 7 in patients with clinically significant dementia the evidence has been summarized in a cochrane review 51 of 15 nimodipine trials in more than 3000 patients with dementia the review reported that the treatment showed efficacy in improving cognition but not activities of daily living at doses of 90 mgday 160 however the evidence was limited by small size and duration mostly 12 weeks of trials as well as the lack of operational diagnostic criteria for ad or vascular dementia tetracycline antibiotics are widely used to treat bacterial infections and are well tolerated in older people but most of the treatment data pertain to short-term periods of exposure studies related to ad have predominantly focused on minocycline 90 fig 7 because it is the most lipophilic tetracycline with greater blood-brain barrier penetration than other agents in this class concerning preclinical studies the drug 90 has been shown to reduce a1-42 aggregation and promote disassembly of pre-formed fibrils in vitro studies186 various groups have independently shown that drug 90 reduces the levels of proinflammatory mediators and microglial activation in a range of mouse models of ad 161 162 163 164 165 besides two of the three studies using transgenic mouse models of ad for 28 days or more of treatment have shown a significant decrease in cerebral a accumulation and improvements in behavioral outcomes as well 165 one of these studies used 8-month-old 3xtg-ad mice and reported reductions in cortical amyloid levels following 4 months of minocycline treatment but no changes in tau pathology was observed190 the third study reported that no benefit concerning amyloid accumulation or behavior over a treatment period of 12 months194 an additional study in a rat model of diabetes demonstrated a reduction in a1-40 and a1-42 levels and associated improvements in behavioral outcomes over 8 weeks of treatment 165 doxycycline 91 is a second generation antibiotic of the tetracycline class that are promising drugs tested in many clinical trials for a number of different pathologies compound 91 is endowed with antiamyloidogenic properties and better crosses the blood-brain barrier but its efficacy has never been tested in ad mice balducci claudia et al showed that 15- to 16-month-old appps1de9 appps1 ad mice receiving 96 under different treatment regimens recovered their memory without plaque reduction an acute 96 treatment was also sufficient to improve appps1 mouse memory suggesting an action against soluble abos this was confirmed in an abo-induced mouse model where the abo-mediated memory impairment was abolished by a its pretreatment although abos induce memory impairment through glial activation assessing the anti-inflammatory action of 96 we found that in both the abo-treated and appps1 mice the memory recovery was associated with a lower neuroinflammation our data promote 96 as a hopeful repositioned drug counteracting crucial neuropathological ad targets 166 drugs that activate retinoic acid receptors rars are used to treat several skin-related conditions such as acne and psoriasis retinoic acid is also vital for normal nerve function and repair there is genomic and epidemiological evidence suggest that impaired retinoic acid signaling may contribute to the etiology of ad 167 chronic deprivation of retinoic acid in rats leads to deposition of a in the vasculature 168 and dysregulation of amyloid processing in the cortex 169 it has been shown that treatment with retinoid x receptor rxr agonist bexarotene 92 fig 7 which is approved for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma leads to pathological and behavioral improvements in transgenic mouse models of ad acute treatment with drug 92 lasting less than 14 days caused a rapid reduction 25 in a1-40 and a1-42 levels and a plaque burden in both young and old mice 170 chronic 90-day treatment resulted in a sustained reduction 30 insoluble a levels mechanistically drug 93 resulted in the upregulation of components of the high-density lipoprotein hdl pathway such as apolipoprotein e apoe which promotes the proteolytic degradation of a 171 further potential mechanism of action of retinoids may include the upregulation of enzymes involved in amyloid clearance such as insulin-degrading enzyme 172 and components of the apoe pathway 170 retinoids may also induce potentially beneficial changes related to insulin signaling and increased neurogenesis and promote neuronal differentiation of progenitor cells 173174 retinoids also act as antioxidants by regulating sod and inhibiting glutathione depletion to reduce mitochondrial damage as well as anti-inflammatory agents by reducing the production of il-6 in vitro both of these activities have potential importance in ad pathology 175176 therefore there was a strong mechanistic rationale for the potential benefit of retinoid therapies beyond amyloid modulation but there is a need to further clarify the impact of treatment on these pathways through in vivo studies overall studies in the literature indicate that retinoids have strong potential mechanistic plausibility as therapies for ad owing to their effects on app processing a clearance insulin signaling and neurogenesis out of the approved drugs data for bexarotene have provided proof of concept as potential candidate for the treatment of alzheimers disease as noted above whereas acitretin 93 fig 7 which is known to penetrate tissues including brain may also be a promising candidate for ad 177 
repurposing on parkinsons disease pd it is a long-term degenerative disorder of the cns which mainly affects the motor system as of 2015 pd affected 62 million individuals of which 117400 people died it usually occurs people over the age of 60 of whom about one percent are affected in addition to the classic motor symptoms caused by the death of dopaminergic neurons parkinsons disease encompasses a wide range of nonmotor symptoms although novel disease-modifying medications that slow or stop parkinsons disease progression are being developed drug repurposing which is the use of existing drugs that have passed numerous toxicity and clinical safety tests for new indications can be used to identify treatment compounds this strategy has revealed that tetracyclines 96 are promising candidates for the treatment of parkinsons disease 178 tetracyclines which are neuroprotective inhibit proinflammatory molecule production matrix metalloproteinase activity mitochondrial dysfunction protein misfoldingaggregation and microglial activation two commonly used semisynthetic second-generation tetracycline derivatives minocycline 90 and doxycycline 91 exhibit effective neuroprotective activity in experimental models of neurodegenerativeneuropsychiatric diseases and no substantial toxicity moreover novel synthetic tetracyclines with different biological properties due to chemical tuning are now available in this review we discuss the multiple effects and clinical properties of tetracyclines and their potential use in parkinsons disease treatment in addition we examine the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory activities of tetracyclines regulate inflammasome signaling based on their excellent safety profiles in humans from their use for over 50 years as antibiotics we propose the repurposing of tetracyclines a multitarget antibiotic to treat parkinsons disease isradipine 88 is an l-type calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine class which has been widely used for the treatment of high blood pressure to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke this drug 88 came into medical use in the year 1989 epidemiological data support that calcium channel blockers may have the potential to reduce the risk of developing pd among dihydropyridines drug 88 has attracted very much as it inhibits the subtype cav1 ca2 channels cav12 and cav13 which are most likely mediate the risk in pd moreover the good brain bioavailability of drug 88 has made it the most promising candidate for repurposing 178179 studies have shown that drug 88 dose repentantly protect the dopaminergic neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine mptp and 6-hydroxydopamine 6-ohda-induced toxicity by reverting dopaminergic neurons to a latent juvenile pacemaking mechanism independent of calcium 180181 an open-label dose-escalation study assessing safety steady-pd of drug 88 controlled release 520 mgday in patients with early pd suggested that the acceptable tolerability at doses of 10 mg per day however at higher doses caused leg edema and dizziness 182 isradipine 88 with 10 mg being the highest dosage was again confirmed in another steady-pd-ii a randomized double-blinded trial which was undertaken in 99 subjects with early pd not requiring dopaminergic therapy 183 results suggest that the most common adverse effect was peripheral edema which occurred in 34 of patients receiving drug 88 10 mg placebo-controlled phase iii clinical study to assess the efficacy of drug 88 10 mg daily as a disease-modifying agent in early pd was completed in november 2018 184 the study recruited 336 patients with early pd not requiring dopaminergic therapy and followed them prospectively for 36 months with the primary outcome designated as a change in the unified parkinson disease rating scale updrs part i-iii score as measured in the on state the results are expected in the middle of 2019 in animal models drug 88 reported with neuroprotection effect in a dose-dependent manner higher doses confirmed better protection inosine 94 fig 7 is a purine nucleoside which has been used as a dietary supplement by athletes for improving aerobic performance it has been shown to have neuroprotective roles by elevating the level of serum urate a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenging property with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis many studies suggest that individuals with increased levels of urate in serum have a reduced risk of developing pd as well as in patients with pd are associated with a reduced rate of disease progression moreover in toxin-based models of pd increased urate levels have conferred protection against dopaminergic cell death stimulated by mptp 6-ohda and rotenone akt-gsk-3b signaling and nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2 nrf2 were thought to involve in these effects therefore given the data supporting a neuroprotective role of urate inosine has been repurposed in the pathogenesis of pd the ability to raise urate level of drug 88 in serum was demonstrated in sure-pd a randomized double blind placebo-controlled in 75 patients with early pd not yet requiring any medication the results showed that inosine raised the mild urate level 6170 mgdl or moderate urate elevation 7180 mgdl after 25 months and well-tolerated with favorable progression rate in updrs score which amounted to 1 point per year on the total updrs scale on the other hand the elevated level of urate in serum have the risk of hypertension coronary heart disease and stroke over the long term these side effects are potentially limiting its utility in older patients with pd however in patients of asian origin with pd inosine elevated urate levels 6170 mgdl without side effects after 1 year of treatment was reported the multicenter sure-pd3 trial which involves a large number of patients 240 patients is currently underway intending to elevate the urate level to 7180 mgdl the result of the study will be expected in the year 2020 
simvastatin 29 since statins are also known to modulate various biological processes relevant to the pathogenesis of pd 185186 simvastatin has been repurposed for treating this disease pretreatment with simvastatin preserved dopaminergic cells and motor behavior in rodents treated with 6-hydroxydopamine 6-ohda promoting antioxidant protein expression or via modulation of nmda receptor and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression 187 188 189 similarly in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine mptp models pretreatment with simvastatin suppressed activation of nf-b protected dopaminergic neurons and improved the motor function 190191 although stains in general have given encouraging preclinical studies epidemiological data regarding the association between usage of statins and the risk of pd are unclear moreover the modest protective effect of statins that disappeared when adjusted for cholesterol level 192 however due to the promising biochemical and pharmacological properties of simvastatin it is currently being examined with 235 patients having moderate-stage pd in phase ii double-blind randomized controlled multicenter trial 
nilotinib 95 fig 7 is a selective c-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cml accumulating evidence suggests that c-abl activation has been linked in the pathogenesis of pd and other synucleinopathies activated phosphorylated c-abl has been found in a high level in post-mortem studies of patients with pd 193194 it was also reported that activation of c-abl in mice induces neurodegeneration in the hippocampal and striatal brain areas 195 continuous work has demonstrated that c-abl phosphorylation occurs as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress 196 which can promote the accumulation of -synuclein in through effects on autophagy mechanisms 195 and can further promote phosphorylation of parkin causing inhibition of its ubiquitin e3 ligase activity inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal death 194 all the above evidences propose that c-abl may be a promising therapeutic target in the management of pd the cns penetration of nilotinib over other abl inhibitors has favored it to fetch more data in pd related studies indeed in preclinical models of pd drug 92 has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and reduces c-abl activity ameliorating autophagic clearance of -synuclein in transgenic and lentiviral gene-transfer models 195 more importantly these effects were seen at doses far lower 110 mgkgday than those used to treat cml which is considered as the key characteristics for potential drug repurposing furthermore nilotinib prevented dopaminergic cell loss and motor impairments induced by mptp in mice which were associated with inhibition of parkin phosphorylation and reduced accumulation of parkin substrate paris thus hinting at another potential mechanism of action 197198 based on these preclinical data a small open-label proof-of-concept study was recently conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nilotinib in 12 patients with pd dementia or dementia with lewy bodies followed-up for 24 weeks followed by a final assessment 12 weeks later 199 the necessary lowest choice of dose for the clinical study was taken as 150300 mg the authors reported that nilotinib was well tolerated though one patient receiving 300 mg was diagnosed with myocardial infarction and two had transient qtc prolongations there was also evidence of cns penetration with nilotinib csf plasma ratio of 12 and 15 with 300 and 150 mg respectively due to numerous methodological limitations these findings should be interpreted with caution 200 due to unwanted off-target nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibition side effects of nilotinib at doses used to treat cml include cardiac conduction abnormalities therefore claims of tolerability should be interpreted with caution indeed the effects on efficacy was also highly impossible to be concluded besides it was also reported in the csf none of the markers used were validated as biomarkers in pd they can also vary greatly between patients and track poorly with disease stage and progression this situation again raises questions about the optimum dose of nilotinib its brain penetrance assessments of cardiovascular effects in patients parkinsons disease pd is a neurodegenerative disorder for which a greater prevalence and incidence is described in men this suggests a protective effect of sex hormones in the brain sex steroids and related drugs are already used in clinic for treatment of menopause symptoms cancer and use for contraception thus they could be repositioned for pd in both men and women steroids are modulators of neurotransmitters system for this reason their effects may help to control pd symptoms and side effect of da medication animal studies provide good support for a protective effect of 17-estradiol 97 fig 8
 progesterone 98 fig 8 raloxifene 99 fig 8 dhea and dutasteride 100 fig 8 on dopaminergic system sex specific treatment options may thus be proposed with non-feminizing agents raloxifene dhea progesterone dutasteride for men indeed the serms 5-reductase inhibitors and dhea are alternatives to estrogens and could be used for both men and women in the current trend to develop personalized medicine estrogens could be used in priority for women because a variety of estrogens and progestins are available and clinically used additional studies are needed to optimize the formulation of these agents timing of initiation and duration of treatment to provide a beneficial therapeutic approach on pd risk and symptoms management 201 
advantageous and limitations of drug re-purposingre-positioning drug re-purposing has gained significance attention among scientists and pharmaceutical companies involved in the identification of new therapeutic usesindications for discontinued during the clinical development phase because of efficacy or commercial reasons recently this approach has accounted for 30 of all newly approved drugs by the fda this emeans the success rate of drug approval is so high when compared to the traditional methods 202 during the year 20122017 203 almost 170 re-purposed drugs entered the drug development pipeline currently these 170 drugs are at different stages of development around 72 are in phase ii clinical development 7 are in proof of concept clinical studies 8 are in pre-clinical stages and regulatory bodies have approved 3 in research and development and 10 almost 70 of the phase i and ii trials for re-purposed drugs were sponsored by academia and 30 by industry besides drug-repositioning approach increases the fruitful collaborations and funding opportunities during the year 20122017 there were almost 40 collaborations relating to drug repurposing among these around 50 of collaborations were between two industries mainly focused on rare diseases almost 20 between an industry and a non-profit organization npo and 9 between industry and academia regarding funding opportunities there was a substantial increase in funds us1 million to us100 million for drug repurposing projects by various funding agencies like national center for advancing translational sciences ncats cures within reach cwr an npo the canadian institutes of health research cihr findacure investigational new chemical entities nces that failed to show efficacypotency and lack of safety for a pre-intended indication typically provides a good start for their revival against new indications by repurposing this can be very much useful in cases of rare diseases such as autoimmune disorders bacterial infections neglected diseases and rare cancers such as pediatric cancers where unmet medical need owing to non-availability of standard therapies worsening clinical outcomes and more difficult to treat unlike nces all re-purposed molecules possess all required safety preclinical and efficacy data enables the investigator to make an informed decision at much earlier stage of drug development substantially reduces the costs time and efforts required for successfully bringing a repositioned drug to the market drug repositioning also offers significant potential for out-licensing as well because of availability of potential buyers drug re-purposing also provides an opportunity to broaden our knowledge without limiting the existing information on the other hand this approach has some limitations due to lack of a clear exclusivity pathwell-defined regulatory guidelines it is still a big hurdleuphill task in utilizing repurposed drug candidates for human use in general a repurposing candidate carries a potential time risk because it has failed previously for a pre-intended indication hence it is advisable to design a branched development program in which the lead compound is evaluated for several indications simultaneously drug repurposing requires thorough comprehension of biological and molecular pathways that a drug can modulate as well as its interactions with endogenous bio-molecules in order for a successful repurposing of that drug molecule when repurposing a drug for rare and neglected diseases there is no assurance that the economic returns will be substantial as expected for a pharmaceutical company lack of financial incentives and research funding is another challenge for pharmaceutical companies problems in clinical trials chance of failure of proof of studies for new indications as well as limited availability of volunteers for large clinical studies in case of rare diseases due to scarcity of patients intellectual property related issues hinder the commercialization of repositioned molecule in conclusion repurposing of drugs has the potential to find and improve treatments for various diseases the drugs listed above are only a few of plenty drugs that can be repurposed in various therapies the drugs discussed in the perspective are summarized in table 1
and compared to the previous uses of each drug with the repurposed use the opportunities for drug repurposing are diverse but a lot still has to be done for its exploration drug repurposing or drug repositioning offers a new strategy to academic centers research council programs and not-for-profit organizations as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for drug development the main advantage of drug repurposing is the established safety of the known candidate compounds when compared to that of the development of novel therapeutic compounds the time and cost required to advance a candidate into clinical trials can be substantially reduced because in vitro and in vivo screening chemical optimization toxicity studies bulk manufacturing and formulation development have already been completed in many cases and can therefore be bypassed moreover these drugs have been on the market for many years and consequently the side effects are already known and safety is therefore very high for medicinal chemists the repurposing of drugs on cancer is a rewarding job for the global healthcare system and possibly a step forward for people to get cheaper and safer medicines rather than afford for cancer therapy however time and minimum investment have to be spent to conduct further studies to improve the safety and success of the repurposed drugs drug repurposing also offers the possibility to develop multi-target drugs that can interact with more than one pathwayprotein at the same time for complex diseases such as neuro inflammatory and degenerative disorders the development of multi-target drugs will be an emerging area for the treatment having multiple advantages such as i synergistic effect ii reduced drug-resistance iii better compliance iv simplified pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and a reduced risk of drug-drug interactions on the other hand the limitations of drug repurposing should also be considered they involve a technical challenges and legal requirements such as intellectual property rights which could hamper the whole process and are often hard to overcome b serious problem on the development of resistant germs on account of consuming a drug for a variety of diseases c owing to target selectivity it is difficult to identify a drug that can cure or treat two different diseases on its own nevertheless drug repurposing is only a part of the solution for the sinking numbers of new diseases and its treatment however it is quite hard to replace the common way of identifying new drug candidates in further this approach could be improved in many differents ways integrating data about repositioning drugs which are available in many public platforms such as pubchem cheembl drugbank and drugcentral various informations including bioactivities combined with their chemical structure physical properties and clinical indications have been recorded in these databases integrating these approaches can extend the domain of applicability of each method and provide novel information combining in silico prediction and in vitro validation may lead to new therapeutic legands high throughput screening of chemicals using in vitro andor in vivo systems can also strongly drive drug repositioning however most in vitro systems currently used for high throughput screening are two-dimensional monolayer cultures that differ from physiological conditions the authors declare no competing financial interest

repurposable drugs for covid-19 via a deep generative model for graphs sumanta ray snehalika lall anirban mukhopadhyay sanghamitra bandyopadhyay alexander schnhuth  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has been creating a worldwide pandemic situation repurposing drugs already shown to be free of harmful side effects for the treatment of covid-19 patients is an important option in launching novel therapeutic strategies therefore reliable molecule interaction data are a crucial basis where drug-protein-protein interaction networks establish invaluable year-long carefully curated data resources however these resources have not yet been systematically exploited using high-performance artificial intelligence approaches here we combine three networks two of which are year-long curated and one of which on sars-cov-2-human host-virus protein interactions was published only most recently 30th of april 2020 raising a novel network that puts drugs human and virus proteins into mutual context we apply variational graph autoencoders vgaes representing most advanced deep learning based methodology for the analysis of data that are subject to network constraints reliable simulations confirm that we operate at utmost accuracy in terms of predicting missing links we then predict hitherto unknown links between drugs and human proteins against which virus proteins preferably bind the corresponding therapeutic agents present splendid starting points for exploring novel host-directed therapy hdt options arxiv200702338v1 q-biomn 5 jul 2020 directed therapies hdt which target human proteins that represent important carriers for the virus to enter and manipulate the human cells offer an important supplementary strategy 3  unlike strategies that directly target the proteins of the virus hdt are thought to be less prone to developing resistance because human proteins are less affected by mutations and therefore represent more sustainable drug targets for establishing hdt one has to identify proteins that are crucial for maintenance and perseverance of the disease causing virus in the human cells once such proteins are targeted the replication machinery of the virus falls apart for all these reasons repurposing drugs for hdt against covid-19 has great potential moreover it provides hope for rapid practical implementation because of the lack of side effects because the basis for drug repurposing screens are molecule interaction data biological interaction networks offer invaluable resources because they have been carefully curated and steadily refined for many years this immediately points out that network based repurposing screens offer unprecedented opportunities in revealing targets for hdts which explains the recent popularity of such approaches in general 4  evidence for the opportunities is further provided by successful approaches based on viral-host networks in particular 5 6  having led to therapy options for treating dengue 7  hiv 8  hepatitis c 9 and ebola 10  beyond fighting viruses treatments for various other diseases have been developed 11 12  since the outbreak of covid-19 a handful of research groups have been trying to exploit network resources developing network algorithms for the discovery of drugs that can be repurposed to act against sars-cov-2 the first attempt was made by zhou et al 13 through an integrative network analysis followed by li et al 14  who combined network data with a comparative analysis on the gene sequences of different viruses to obtain drugs that can potentially be repurposed to act against sars-cov-2 shortly thereafter gordon et al 15 conducted pioneering work by generating a map that juxtaposes sars-cov-2 proteins with human proteins that were found to interact in affinity-purification mass spectrometry ap-ms screens furthermore in independent work dick et al 16 identified high confidence interactions between human proteins and sars-cov-2 proteins using sequence-based ppi predictors aka pipe4  sprint both of the studies 15 16 on sars-cov-2 provide data that had so far been urgently missing in the fight against covid-19 only now we are able to link existing long term curated and highly reliable drug-protein and human protein-protein interaction data with proteins of sars-cov-2 in other words only now we can draw links between the molecular agents of the virus and existing drugs on a scale that is sufficiently large to allow for systematic high throughput repurposing screens still of course it remains to design develop and implement the corresponding strategies in order to exploit the now decisively augmented resources as above-mentioned in order to exploit resources to a maximum one optimally makes use of sufficiently advanced ai techniques in this work to the best of our knowledge for the first time we combine all arguments raised above figure 1  we have combined three interaction networks two of which represent year-long curated and much refined publicly available resources namely drug-gene interaction and the human interactome together compiled from eight different reliable and publicly accessible sources and one of which the sars-cov-2-human protein-protein-interaction ppi network was published only a few weeks ago the integrated network has four types of nodes raising a comprehensive interaction network see a  b in 1 sars-cov-2 proteins 2 sars-cov-2-associated host proteins cov-host 3 human proteins other than 2 4 and drugs this means that we put drugs human proteins and sars-cov-2 proteins into mutual context via the links provided by this network however because the encompassing network is built from three subnetworks links between nodes from different individual subnetworks are presumably missing it remains to predict them using an ai approach preferably of utmost performance this ai approach needs to identify links across the individual subnetworks because new cross-subnetwork links may imply links within the established networks as a consequence the ai approach should also predict new links within the individual parts of our network if this is called for ai model first stage node2vec see c in figure 1  to bring the link prediction machinery into effect we raise a model that operates in two stages first we employ a network embedding strategy here node2vec 17  which extracts node features from the integrated network in a bit more formal detail node2vec converts the adjacency matrix that represents the network into a fixed-size low-dimensional latent space the elements of which are the feature vectors of the nodes thereby node2vec aims at preserving the properties of the nodes relative to their surroundings in the network for efficiency reasons node2vec makes use of a sampling strategy the result of this step is a feature matrix f where rows refer to nodes and columns refer to the inferred network features figure 1  in the next step we employ variational graph autoencoders vgae as a most recent graph neural network based technique shown to be of utmost accuracy to predict links in networks that although missing are highly likely to exist 18  vgaes require the original graph provided by its adjacency matrix a and optionally a feature matrix that annotates the nodes of the network with helpful additional information often f does not necessarily refer to the topology of the network itself here however we do make use of the feature matrix f that was inferred from a itself in the first step we found that despite just being an alternative representation of a using f aided in raising prediction accuracy substantially this may not be surprising however because f consists of knowledge obtained using node2vec which as being complementary to vgaes from a methodical point of view cannot necessarily revealed by vgaes itself predicting missing links see d in figure 1  after training the vgae we finally predict links in the encompassing drug-human-virus interaction network that had remained to be missing for this we make use of the decoding part of the vgae which re-raises the network based on the latent representation the network provided by the encoder re-raising the network results in edges between nodes that although not having been explicit before are imperative to exist relative to the encoded version of the network thereby one predicts links between drugs and sars-cov-2-associated human proteins in particular although these links had not been explicit elements of the drug-human interaction subnetwork before their existence is implied by the topological constraints the comprehensive network imposes thus our model predicts both drugs and proteins repurposing these drugs leads to them targeting the matching proteins see figure 1 for the total workflow we just described addressing computation time to reduce the computation time we used a fast version of vgaes as proposed by salha et al 19  this fast version relies on a strategy by which to sample nodes using several non-overlapping test sets for different numbers of sampling nodes we evaluated the model based on sampling 5000 nodes as most suitable for our prediction task let g  v e be the entire drug-human-virus interaction network in the following where nodes v represent drugs or proteins and edges e represent interactions between them we run node2vec 17 on g to obtain a feature matrix f where rows can be identfied with elements from v and columns represent features extracted from g after having computed f we encode the network g into the embedding space using variational graph autoencoder vgae techniques in detail we use the fastgae model 19 as a version that decisively speeds up the learning process in the decoding phase as a major argument for encoding fastgae utilizes a popular graph convolutional network gcn encoder this leads to encoding all nodes into the latent variable based embedding space therefore fastgae makes use of the original graph adjacency matrix a which codes the original topology of the graph and f using fastgae is explained by the fact that in the decoding phase a new version of the adjacency matrix has to be established where a is huge n  n where n is the number of all drugs human proteins and sars-cov-2 proteins together which slows down less rapid implementations of vgaes decisively to sort out this issue fastgae randomly samples subgraphs g s  referring to smaller sets of nodes s  v of size n s  and reconstructs the corresponding submatrices a s in several iterations each of which refers to a different s finally the submatrices of all samples are combined into an overarching matrix as an approximation of the matrix that gets reconstructed as a whole in the decoding phase of slow approaches note that the approximation was shown to be highly accurate 19   the pandemic of covid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 has affected more than 6 million people so far it has caused about 04 million deaths in over 200 countries worldwide httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml with numbers still increasing rapidly covid-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by a highly virulent and contagious novel coronavirus strain sars-cov-2 which is an enveloped single-stranded rna virus 1  sensing the urgency researchers have been relentlessly searching for possible therapeutic strategies in the last few weeks so as to control the rapid spread in their quest drug repurposing establishes one of the most relevant options where drugs that have been approved at least preclinically for fighting other diseases are screened for their possible alternative use against the disease of interest which is covid-19 here because they were shown to lack severe side effects before risks in the immediate application of repurposed drugs are limited in comparison with de novo drug design repurposing drugs offers various advantages most importantly the reduced time frame in development suits the urgency of the situation in general furthermore most recent and most advanced artificial intelligence ai approaches have boosted drug repurposing in terms of throughput and accuracy enormously finally it is important to understand that the 3d structures of the majority of viral proteins have remained largely unknown which raises the puts up the obstacles for direct approaches to work even higher the foundation of ai based drug repurposing are molecule interaction data optimally reflecting how drugs viral and host proteins get into contact with each other during the life cycle of a virus the viral proteins interact with various human proteins in the infected cells through these interactions the virus hijacks the host cell machinery for replication thereby affecting the normal function of the proteins it interacts with to develop suitable therapeutic strategies and design antiviral drugs a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between viral and human proteins is essential 2  when watching out for drugs that can be repurposed to fight the virus one has to realize that targeting single virus proteins easily leads to the viruses escaping the rather simpleminded attack by raising resistance-inducing mutations therefore host-1 we link existing high-quality long-term curated and refined large scale drugprotein -protein interaction data with 2 molecular interaction data on sars-cov-2 itself raised only a handful of weeks ago 3 exploit the resulting overarching network using most advanced ai boosted techniques 4 for repurposing drugs in the fight against sars-cov-2 5 in the frame of hdt based strategies as for 3-5 we will highlight interactions between sars-cov-2-host protein and human proteins important for the virus to persist using most advanced deep learning techniques that cater to exploiting network data we are convinced that many of the fairly broad spectrum of drugs we raise will be amenable to developing successful hdts against covid-19 in the following we will first describe the workflow of our analysis pipeline and the basic ideas that support it we proceed by carrying out a simulation study that proves that our pipeline accurately predicts missing links in the encompassing drug -human protein -sars-cov-2-protein network that we raise and analyze namely we demonstrate that our high-performance ai supported prediction pipeline accurately re-establishes links that had been explicitly removed before this provides sound evidence that the interactions that we predict in the full network most likely reflect true interactions between molecular interfaces subsequently we continue with the core experiments we predict links to be missing in the full without artificially having removed links encompassing drug -human protein -sars-cov-2-protein network raised by combining links from year-long curated resources on the one hand and most recently published covid-19 resources on the other hand as per our simulation study a large fraction if not the vast majority of the predictions establish true hence actionable interactions between drugs on the one hand and sars-cov-2 associated human proteins hence of use in hdt on the other hand a b c d figure 1  overall workflow of the proposed method the three networks sars-cov-2-host ppi human ppi and drug-target network panel-a are mapped by their common interactors to form an integrated representation panel-b the neighborhood sampling strategy node2vec converts the network into fixed-size low dimensional representations that perverse the properties of the nodes belonging to the three major components of the integrated network panel-c the resulting feature matrix f from the node embeddings and adjacency matrix a from the integrated network are used to train a vgae model which is then used for prediction panel-d for the purposes of high-confidence validation we carry out a literature study on the overall 92 drugs we put forward for this we inspect the postulated mechanism-of-action of the drugs in the frame of several diseases including sars-cov and mers-cov driven diseases in particular see figure 1 for the workflow of our analysis pipeline and the basic ideas that support it we will describe all important steps in the paragraphs of this subsection this reduces the training time compared to the general graph autoencoder model we tested the model performance for a different number of sampled nodes keeping track of the area under the roc curve auc average precision ap score and model training time in the frame of a train-validation-test split at proportions 811 table 1 shows the performance of the model for sampled sugraph sizes n s  7000 5000 3000 2500 and 1000 for 5000 sampled nodes the models performance is sufficiently good enough concerning its training time and validation-auc and -ap score the average test roc-auc and ap score of the model for n s 5000 are 8853  003 and 8444  004 to know the efficacy of the model in discovering the existing edges between only cov-host and drug nodes we train the model with n s 5000 on an incomplete version of the graph where the links between cov-host and drugs have been removed we further compute the feature matrix f based on the incomplete graph and use it the test set consists of all the previously removed edges the model performance is no doubt better for discovering those edges between cov-host and drug nodes roc-auc 9356  001 ap 9088  002 for 100 runs the fastgae model is learned with the feature matrix f and adjacency matrix a the node feature matrix f is obtained from a using the node2vec neighborhood sampling strategy the model performance is evaluated with and without using f as feature matrix figure 2 shows the average performance of the model on validation sets with and without f as input for the different number of sampling nodes we calculate average auc and ap scores for 50 complete runs of the model from figure 2  it is evident that including f as feature matrix enhances the models performance markedly  we use the node2vec framework to learn low dimensional embeddings of each node in the compiled network it uses the skipgram algorithm of the word2vec model to learn the embeddings which eventually groups nodes with a similar role or having a similar connection pattern within the graph similar role ensures that nodes within the setsgroups are structurally similarequivalent than the other nodes outside the groups two nodes are said to be structurally equivalent if they have identical connection patterns to the rest of the network 20  to explore this we have analyzed the embedding results in two steps first we explore structurally equivalent nodes to identify roles and similar connection patterns to the rest of the networks and later use lovain clustering to examine the same within the groupsclusters the mostsimilar function of the node2vec inspects the structurally equivalent nodes within the network we find out all the cov-host nodes which are most similar to the drug nodes while it is expected to observe nodes of the same types within the neighborhood of a particular node in some cases we found some drugs are neighbors of cov-host proteins with high probability pobs  065 sars-cov-2 3cl protease 21  some other drugs such as clenbuterol and fenbendazole the probable neighbor of ppp1cb and eef1a respectively are used as bronchodilators in asthma to explore the closely connected groups we have constructed a neighborhood graph using the k-th nearest neighbor algorithm from the node embeddings and apply louvain clustering  figure 3 -panel-c although there is a clear separation between host proteins including cov-host cluster and drug cluster some of the louvain clusters contain both types of nodes for example louvain cluster-16 and -17 contain four and two drugs along with the other cov-host proteins respectively figure 3 panel-d represents a network consisting of these six drugs and their most similar cov-host nodes for drug-cov-host interaction prediction we exploit variational graph autoencoder vgae an unsupervised graph neural network model first introduced in 18 to leverage the concept of variational autoencoder in graph-structured data to make learning faster we utilized the fastgae model to take advantage of the fast decoding phase we have used two data matrices in the fastgae model for learning one is the adjacency matrix which represents the interaction information over all the nodes and the other one is the feature matrix representing the low-dimensional embeddings of all the nodes in the network we create a test set of non-edges by removing all existing links between drugs and cov-host proteins from all possible combinations 332 cov-host  1302 drugs of edges the model is trained on the whole network with the adjacency matrix a and feature matrix f the trained model is then applied to the test non-edges to know the most probable links we identified a total of 692 most probable links with 92 drugs and 78 cov-host proteins with a probability threshold of 08 the predicted cov-host proteins are involved in different crucial pathways of viral infection table 4 the p-values for pathway and go enrichment are calculated by using the hypergeometric test with 005 fdr corrections figure 4  panel-a shows the heatmap of probability scores between predicted drugs and cov-host proteins to get more details of the predicted bipartite graph we figure 4  drug-cov-host predicted interaction panel-a shows heatmap of probability scores between 92 drugs and 78 cov-host proteins the four predicted bipartite modules are annotated as b1 b2 b3 and b4 within the heatmap the drugs are colored based on their clinical phase red-launched

and e represents quasi-bicliques for one two three and more than three drugs molecules respectively use a weighted bipartite clustering algorithm proposed by j beckett 23  this results in 4 bipartite

bipartite modules b1 contains 11 drugs including some antibiotics anisomycin midecamycin and anti-cancer drugs doxorubicin camptothecin b3 also has some antibiotics such as puromycin demeclocycline dirithromycin geldanamycin and chlortetracycline among them the first three are widely used for bronchitis pneumonia and respiratory tract infections 24  some other drugs such as lobeline and ambroxol included in the b3 module have a variety of therapeutic uses including respiratory disorders and bronchitis the high confidence predicted interactions with threshold 09 is shown in figure 5 panel-a to highlight some repurposable drug combination and their predicted cov-host target we perform a weighted clustering clusterone 25 on this network and found some quasy-bicluques shown in panel-b-e we matched our predicted drugs with the drug list recently published by zhou et al 13 and found six common drugs mesalazine vinblastine menadione medrysone fulvestrant and apigenin among them apigenin has a known effect in the antiviral activity together with quercetin rutin and other flavonoids 26  mesalazine is also proven to be extremely effective in the treatment of other viral diseases like influenza ah5n1 virus 27  baclofen a benzodiazepine receptor gabaa-receptor agonist has a potential role in antiviral associated treatment 28  antiinflammatory antecedents fisetin is also tested for antiviral activity such as for inhibition of dengue denv virus infection 29  it down-regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by a denv infection both of the drugs are listed in the high confidence interaction set with the three cov-hosts tapt1 interacted with sars-cov-2 protein orf9c slc30a6 interacted with sars-cov-2 protein orf9c and trim59 interacted with sars-cov-2 protein orf3a  figure 5 -panel-c topoisomerase inhibitors play an active role as antiviral agents by inhibiting the viral dna replication 30 31  some topoisomerase inhibitors such as camptothecin daunorubicin doxorubicin irinotecan and mitoxantrone are predicted to interact with several cov-host proteins it has been demonstrated that the anticancer drug camptothecin cpt and its derivative irinotecan have a potential role in antiviral activity 32 33  it inhibits host cell enzyme topoisomerase-i which is required for the initiation as well as completion of viral functions in host cell 34  daunorubicin dnr has also been demonstrated as an inhibitor of hiv-1 virus replication in human host cells 35  the conventional anticancer antibiotic doxorubicin was identified as a selective inhibitor of in vitro dengue and yellow fever virus replication 36  it is also reported that doxorubicin coupling with monoclonal antibody can create an immunoconjugate that can eliminate hiv-1 infection in mice cell 37  mitoxantrone shows antiviral activity against the human herpes simplex virus hsv1 by reducing the transcription of viral genes in many human cells that are essential for dna synthesis 38  histone deacetylases inhibitors hdaci are generally used as latency-reversing agents for purging hiv-1 from the latent reservoir like cd4 memory cell 39  our predicted drug list table 3  contains two hdaci scriptaid and vorinostat vorinostrate can be used to achieve latency reversal in the hiv-1 virus safely and repeatedly 40  asymptomatic patients infected with sars-cov-2 are of significant concern as they are more vulnerable to infect large number of people than symptomatic patients moreover in most cases 99 percentile patients develop symptoms after an average of 5-14 days which is longer than the incubation period of sars mers or other viruses 41  to this end hdaci may serve as good candidates for recognizing and clearing the cells in which sars-cov-2 latency has been reversed heat shock protein 90 hsp is described as a crucial host factor in the life cycle of several viruses that includes an entry in the cell nuclear import transcription and replication 42 43  hsp90 is also shown to be an essential factor for sars-cov-2 envelop e protein 44  in 45  hsp90 is described as a promising target for antiviral drugs the list of predicted drugs contains three hsp inhibitors tanespimycin geldanamycin and its derivative alvespimycin the first two have a substantial effect in inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus and human enterovirus 71 ev71 respectively recently in 46  geldanamycin and its derivatives are proposed to be an effective drug in the treatment of covid-19 inhibiting dna synthesis during viral replication is one of the critical steps in disrupting the viral infection the list of predicted drugs contains six such small moleculesdrugs viz niclosamide azacitidine anisomycin novobiocin primaquine menadione and metronidazole dna synthesis inhibitor niclosamide has a great potential to treat a variety of viral infections including sars-cov mers-cov and hcv virus 47 and has recently been described as a potential candidate to fight the 919 sars-cov-2 virus 47  novobiocin an aminocoumarin antibiotic is also used in the treatment of zika virus zikv infections due to its protease inhibitory activity in 2005 chloroquine cq had been demonstrated as an effective drug against the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov recently hydroxychloroquine hcq sulfate a derivative of cq has been evaluated to efficiently inhibit sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 48  therefore another anti-malarial aminoquinolin drug primaquine may also contribute to the attenuation of the inflammatory response of covid-19 patients primaquine is also established to be effective in the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia pcp 49  cardiac glycosides have been shown to play a crucial role in antiviral drugs these drugs target cell host proteins which help reduce the resistance to antiviral treatments the antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides have been described by inhibiting the pump function of na k-atpase this makes them essential drugs against human viral infections the predicted list of drugs contains three cardiac glycosides atpase inhibitors digoxin digitoxigenin and ouabain these drugs have been reported to be effective against different viruses such as herpes simplex influenza chikungunya coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus 50  mg132 proteasomal inhibitor is established to be a strong inhibitor of sars-cov replication in early steps of the viral life cycle 51  mg132 inhibits the cysteine protease m-calpain which results in a pronounced inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication in the host cell in 52  resveratrol has been demonstrated to be a significant inhibitor mers-cov infection resveratrol treatment decreases the expression of nucleocapsid n protein of mers-cov which is essential for viral replication as mg132 and resveratrol play a vital role in inhibiting the replication of other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov so they may be potential candidates for the prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 another drug captopril is known as angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb which directly inhibits the production of angiotensin ii in 53  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is demonstrated as the binding site for sars-cov-2 so angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb may be good candidates to use in the tentative treatment for sars-cov-2 infections 54  in summary our proposed method predicts several drug targets and multiple repurposable drugs that have prominent literature evidence of uses as antiviral drugs especially for two other coronavirus species sars-cov and mers-cov some drugs are also directly associated with the treatment of sars-cov-2 identified by recent literature however further clinical trials and several preclinical experiments are required to validate the clinical benefits of these potential drugs and drug targets  in this work we have successfully generated a list of high-confidence candidate drugs that can be repurposed to counteract sars-cov-2 infections the novelties have been to integrate most recently published sars-cov-2 protein interaction data on the one hand and to use most recent most advanced ai deep learning based high-performance prediction machinery on the other hand as the two major points in experiments we have validated that our prediction pipeline operates at utmost accuracy confirming the quality of the predictions we have raised the recent publication april 30 2020 of two novel sars-cov-2-human protein interaction resources 15 16 has unlocked enormous possibilities in studying virulence and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 and the driving mechanisms behind it only now various experimental and computational approaches in the design of drugs against covid-19 have become conceivable and only now such approaches can be exploited truly systematically at both sufficiently high throughput and accuracy here to the best of our knowledge we have done this for the first time we have integrated the new sars-cov-2 protein interaction data with well established long-term curated human protein and drug interaction data these data capture hundreds of thousands approved interfaces between encompassing sets of molecules either reflecting drugs or human proteins as a result we have obtained a comprehensive drug-human-virus interaction network that reflects the latest state of the art in terms of our knowledge about how sars-cov-2 and interacts with human proteins and repurposable drugs for exploiting the new network-already establishing a new resource in its own right-we have opted for most recent and advanced deep learning based technology a generic reason for this choice is the surge in advances and the resulting boost in operative prediction performance of related methods over the last 3-4 years a particular reason is to make use of most advanced graph neural network based techniques namely variational graph autoencoders as a deep generative model of utmost accuracy the practical implementation of which 19 was presented only a few months ago just like the relevant network data note that only this recent implementation enables to process networks of sizes in the range of common molecular interaction data in essence graph neural networks learn the structure of links in networks and infer rules that underlie the interplay of links based on the knowledge gained they enable to predict links and output the corresponding links together with probabilities for them to indeed be missing simulation experiments reflecting scenarios where links known to exist in our network were re-established by prediction upon their removal pointed out that our pipeline does indeed predict missing links at utmost accuracy encouraged by these simulations we proceeded by performing the core experiments and predicted links to be missing without prior removal of links in our encompassing network these core experiments revealed 692 high confidence interactions relating to 92 drugs in our experiments we focused on predicting links between drugs and human proteins that in turn are known to interact with sars-cov-2 proteins sars-cov-2 associated host proteins we have decidedly put the focus not on drug -sars-cov-2-protein interactions which would have reflected more direct therapy strategies against the virus instead we have focused on predicting drugs that serve the purposes of host-directed therapy hdt options because hdt strategies have proven to be more sustainable with respect to mutations by which the virus escapes a response to the therapy applied note that hdt strategies particularly cater to drug repurposing attempts because repurposed drugs have already proven to lack severe side effects because they are either already in use or have successfully passed the preclinical trial stages we further systematically categorized the 92 repurposable drugs into 70 categories based on their domains of application and molecular mechanism according to this we identified and highlighted several drugs that target host proteins that the virus needs to enter and subsequently hijack human cells one such example is captopril which directly inhibits the production of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 in turn already known to be a crucial host factor for sars-cov-2 further we identified primaquine as an antimalaria drug used to prevent the malaria and also pneumocystis pneumonia pcp relapses because it interacts with the tim complex timm29 and alg11 moreover we have highlighted drugs that act as dna replication inhibitor niclosamide anisomycin glucocorticoid receptor agonists medrysone atpase inhibitors digitoxigenin digoxin topoisomerase inhibitors camptothecin irinotecan and proteosomal inhibitors mg-132 note that some drugs are known to have rather severe side effects from their original use doxorubicin vinblastine but the disrupting effects of their short-term usage in severe covid-19 infections may mean sufficient compensation in summary we have compiled a list of drugs which when repurposed are of great potential in the fight against the covid-19 pandemic where therapy options are urgently needed our list of predicted drugs suggests both options that had been identified and thoroughly discussed before and new opportunities that had not been pointed out earlier the latter class of drugs may offer valuable chances for pursuing new therapy strategies against covid-19 we have utilized three categories of interaction datasets human protein-protein interactome data sars-cov-2-host protein interaction data and drug-host interaction data we have taken sars-cov-2-host interaction information from two recent studies by gordon et al and dick et al 15 16  in 15  332 high confidence interactions between sars-cov-2 and human proteins are predicted using using affinity-purification mass spectrometry ap-ms in 16  261 high confidence interactions are identified using sequence-based ppi predictors pipe4  sprint the drug-target interaction information has been collected from five databases viz drugbank database v43 57  chembl 58 database therapeutic target database ttd 59  pharmgkb database and iupharbps guide to pharmacology 60  total number of drugs and drug-host interactions used in this study are 1309 and 1788407 respectively we have built a comprehensive list of human ppis from two datasets 1 ccsb human interactome database consisting of 7000 genes and 13944 high-quality binary interactions 61-63  2 the human protein reference database 56 which consists of 8920 proteins and 53184 ppis the summary of all the datasets is provided in table 2  cmap database 22 is used to annotate the drugs with their usage different disease areas we have utilized node2vec 17  an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks it maps the nodes to a low-dimensional feature space that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods the principle of feature learning framework in a graph can be described as follows let g  v e be a given graph where v represents a set of nodes and e represents the set of edges the feature representation of nodes v  is given by a mapping function f  v  r d  where d specify the feature dimension the f may also be represented as a node feature matrix of dimension of v   d for each node v  v  nn s v  v defines a network neighborhood of node v which is generated using a neighbourhood sampling strategy s the sampling strategy can be described as an interpolation between breadth-first search and depth-first search technique 17  the objective function can be described as this maximizes the likelihood of observing a network neighborhood nn s v for a node v given on its feature representation f  now the probability of observing a neighborhood node n i  nn s v given the feature representation of the source node v is given as  where n i is the i th neighbor of node v in neighborhood set nn s v the conditional likelihood of each source v and neighborhood node n i  nn s v  pair is represented as softmax of dot product of their features f v and f n i  as follows variational graph autoencoder vgae is a framework for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data 64  this model uses latent variables and is effective in learning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs the graph autoencoder consists of two stacked models 1 encoder and 2 decoder first an encoder based on graph convolution networks gcn 18 maps the nodes into a low-dimensional embedding space subsequently a decoder attempts to reconstruct the original graph structure from the encoder representations both models are jointly trained to optimize the quality of the reconstruction from the embedding space in an unsupervised way the functions of these two model can be described as follows encoder it uses graph convolution network gcn on adjacency matrix a and the feature representation matrix f encoder generates a d -dimensional latent variable z i for each node i  v  with v   n that corresponds to each embedding node with d  n the inference model of the encoder is given below where rz i a f corresponds to normal distribution n  z i  i   2 i   i and  i are the gaussian mean and variance parameters the actual embedding vectors z i are samples drawn from these distributions decoder it is a generative model that decodes the latent variables z i to reconstruct the matrix a using inner products with sigmoid activation from embedding vector z where a is the decoded adjacency matrix the objective function of the variational graph autoencoder vgae can be written as  the objective function c v gae maximizes the likelihood of decoding the adjacency matrix wrt graph autoencoder weights using stochastic gradient decent here d kl  represents kullback-leibler divergence 65 and pz is the prior distribution of latent variable drug-sars-cov-2 link prediction 1 adjacency matrix preparation in this work we consider an undirected graph g  v e with v   n nodes and e  m edges we denote a as the binary adjacency matrix of g here v consists of sars-cov-2 proteins cov-host proteins drug-target proteins and drugs the matrix a contains a total of n  16444 nodes given as where n nc is the number of sars-cov-2 proteins n dt is the number of drug targets whereas n nt and n d represent the number of cov-host and drugs nodes respectively total number of edges is given by where e 1 represents interactions between sars-cov-2 and human host proteins e 2 is the number of interactions among human proteins and e 3 represents the number of interactions between drugs and human host proteins the neighborhood sampling strategy is used here to prepare a feature representation of all nodes a flexible biased random walk procedure is employed to explore the neighborhood of each node a random walk in a graph g can be described as the probability where v x is the transition probability between nodes v and x where v x  e and a i is the i th node in the walk of length l the transition probability is given by v x  c pq t x  w vx  where t is the previous node of v n the walk w vx is the static edge weights and p q are the two parameters which guides the walk the coefficient c pq t x is given by where distancet x represents the shortest path distance between nodes t and node x the process of feature matrix f nd generation is governed by the node2vec algorithm it starts from every nodes and simulates r random walks of fixed length l in every step of walk transition probability v x govern the sampling the generated walk of each iteration is included to a walk-list finally the stochastic gradient descent is applied to optimize the list of walks and result is returned 3 link prediction scalable and fast variational graph autoencoder fastvgae 19 is utilized in our proposed work to reduce the computational time of vgae in large network the adjacency matrix a and the feature matrix f are given into the encoder of fastvgae the encoder uses graph convolution neural network gcn on the entire graph to create the latent representation z the encoder works on full adjacency matrix a after encoding sampling is done and decoder works on the sampled sub graph the mechanism of decoder of fastvgae is slightly different from traditional vgae it regenerate the adjacency matrix a based on a subsample of graph nodes v s  it uses a graph node sampling technique to randomly sample the reconstructed nodes at each iteration each node is assigned with a probability p i and the selection of noes is based on the high score of p i  the probability p i is given by the following equation where f i is the degree of node i and  is the sharpening parameter we take   2 in our study the node selection process is repeated until v s   n s  where n s is the number of sampling nodes the decoder reconstructs the smaller matrix a s of dimension n s  n s instead of decoding the main adjacency matrix a the decoder function follows the following equation a s i j  sigmoidz t i z j  i j  v s v s  at each training iteration different subgraph g s  is drawn using the sampling method after the model is trained the drug-cov-host links are predicted using the following equation where a i j represents the possible links between all combination of sars-cov-2 nodes and drug nodes for each combination of nodes the model gives probability based on the logistic sigmoid function  perspectives for repurposing drugs for the coronavirus disease 2019 sarah cherian s megha agrawal atanu basu priya abraham raman gangakhedkar r balram bhargava   coronaviruses covs belong to the family coronaviridae and are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses1 the covs are seen to be distributed in mammals as well as in humans causing mild infections however the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov from zoonotic sources in 2002 and 2012 respectively were responsible for high infection and mortality rates2 a novel cov named as sars-cov-2 causative agent of the cov disease 2019 covid-19 has caused 750890 confirmed cases globally with 36405 reported mortalities3 the sars-cov-2 belongs to the beta cov genus which also includes the sars-cov-1 and the mers-cov the lack of approved effective drug therapeutic protocols for covs would be a challenge for the treatment of the newly emerged covid-19 infections worldwide drug repurposing which is defined as identifying alternative uses for approved or investigational drugs outside their defined indication could be a possible way to overcome the time limitation of research and development needed to design a therapeutic drug to combat the pathogen4 apart from having a lower risk of failure most repurposed drugs have cleared phase i trials and require lower investment but above all the drug repurposing strategy drastically reduces the time frame for development5 the drug repurposing or repositioning approach thus can facilitate prompt clinical decisions at lower costs than de novo drug development though drug repurposing is sometimes based on chance observations target-based repurposing of drugs depends on prior understanding of the precise molecular or cellular element that is recognized by the proposed drug67 the target may or may not essentially have the same mechanism of action in both the diseased states antivirals that can target the viral proteins or the key events in the viral life cycle including virus-host cell interactions replication assembly and egress would belong to this class drug repurposing to identify candidate drug compounds centred on the target-based criteria can thus be generally distinguished into virus- and host-based therapeutics this review outlines the present status of both virus-based and host-based drug repurposing evaluations against the covs the focus would be on the food and drug administration fda-approved marketed drugs or those under clinical trials against the covs in general and the sars-cov-2 in particular the mpro is a promising viral target for the design of drugs against sarsmers as the polyprotein cleavage by the mpro facilitates the formation of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and the helicase which are the major proteins of viral replication811122223 various classes of protease inhibitors such as halomethylketones phthalhydrazide ketones  -epoxyketones glutamic acid and glutamine peptides with a trifluoromethylketone group zinc or mercury conjugates c2-symmetric diols peptidomimetic- -unsaturated esters aldehydes anilides nitriles pyrimidinone and pyrazole analogues benzotriazole n-phenyl-2-acetamide and biphenyl sulphone are reported to inhibit the sars-cov-1 mpro 3clpro2425 fig 2 of these prospective mpro inhibitors the common fda-approved ones are well-known hiv-1 protease inhibitors26 among these lopinavir andor a ritonavir-boosted form of lopinavir has been reported to have anti-cov activity in vitro and also has shown improved outcomes in non-human primates infected with mers-cov and in non-randomized trials with sars patients27 both lopinavir and ritanovir are under phase iiiii clinical trials for mers-cov nct0284584328 these are also reported to have activity against hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and animal covs29 cinanserin sq 10643 a serotonin antagonist demonstrated antiviral activity against sars-cov-1 and the inhibition of replication was probably by blocking the activity of mpro14 flavonoids herbacetin rhoifolin and pectolinarin that are known to possess antioxidant effects associated with diseases such as cancer alzheimers disease and atherosclerosis were also noted to efficiently inhibit sars-cov-1 mpro15 disulfiram which is an approved drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence demonstrated in vitro inhibition of the pl2pro enzyme of sars and mers30 the study also provided future directions for the development of fragment-linked inhibitors for improving its potency31 the rdrp which is critical for cov transcription and replication is involved in producing the genomic and subgenomic rnas nucleoside analogues such as favipiravir ribavirin penciclovir remdesivir and galidesivir are well-known rdrp inhibitors a guanosine analogue ribavirin showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several viruses including respiratory syncytial virus hepatitis c and e viruses hcv hev chikungunya and viral haemorrhagic fevers3233 though the mechanism of action is not fully understood it is hypothesized that the drug may be involved in the inhibition of mrna capping or viral rna synthesis the in vitro antiviralactivityofribavirin was demonstrated against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov34 and in rhesus monkeys infected with mers-cov35 the drug has been used in the treatment of sars and mers patients though the benefits are ambiguous further in severely infected cov patients there could be side effects associated with high doses36 immucillin-a galidesivir an adenosine analogue has been shown recently as a broad-spectrum rdrp inhibitor against several rna viruses such as paramyxoviruses flaviviruses togaviruses bunyaviruses arenaviruses picornaviruses filoviruses and also against sarsmers-covs37 though it has been reported as a treatment option during the 2014-2016 west africa ebola virus epidemic no data for animalhuman were reported for covs until recently for the sars-cov-216 sheahan et al38 showed that another nucleoside analogue remdesivir gs-5734 presently under clinical trials for the ebola virus demonstrated inhibition of the replication of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov inprimary human airway epithelial cells they also demonstrated broad-spectrum anti-cov activity against bat-covs and human covs in primary human lung cells1738 in another recent study remdesivir was shown to possess better in vitro antiviral efficacy against mers-cov in comparison to lopinavir and ritanovir1739 in mice remdesivir improved pulmonary function with lower viral loads in the lungs both as a prophylactic and as a therapeutic1740 another nucleoside analogue acyclovir that was modified by incorporating fleximers to increase its binding affinity has been reported to be effective in vitro against mers-cov and hcov-nl633941 though to the best of our knowledge no animal or human data are available covs possess a surface structural spike glycoprotein s which is vital for interaction with the host cell receptor and subsequent virus entry into the cell the s protein constitutes two subunits the s1 receptor-binding and the s2 membrane fusion domains40 griffithsin a lectin extract red algae has been reported to bind to oligosaccharides on the surface of various viral glycoproteins including hiv glycoprotein 120 and sars-cov glycoproteins41 resveratrol a natural compound from grape which is in a clinical phase for heart and other diseases was also reported to effectively inhibit mers-cov in vitro by downregulation of the apoptosis induced by the virus42 the possible site of action was suggested to be the nucleocapsid protein amodiaquine and mefloquine antimalarial drugs were also found to be effective against mers-cov43 loperamide an antidiarrhoeal agent that was identified by the screening of an fda-approved compound library showed in vitro antiviral activity against mers44 viral nucleic acids are mainly composed of nucleosides and nucleotides the drugs that target these have mycophenolic acid mpa as the active compound and inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and guanine monophosphate synthesis45 broad-spectrum activity has been reported by mpa against a broad range of viruses including orthohepadnaviruses hepatitis b flaviviruses hcv arboviruses and covs mpa possessed anti-mers-cov activity in vitro though it was shown to result in a worsened outcome in the marmoset primate model26 treatment of renal transplant recipients with mpa resulted in severe mers46 combination therapy with interferon beta-1b ifn--1b was however reported to be synergistic in vitro47 implying that monotherapy with the drug might not be useful for treating covs chlorpromazine an antipsychotictranquilizer drug is also known to affect the assembly of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane44 it showed broad-spectrum in vitro activity against viruses such as hcv alphaviruses sars-cov-1 and mers-cov ouabain and bufalin examples of a class of steroids which bind sodium- or potassium-transporting atpase subunit 1 also inhibited the endocytosis of mers-cov mediated by clathrin56 however very high ec50cmax half-maximal effective concentration valuepeak serum concentration level ratios at the typical dosages or toxicity limit the clinical use of these endocytosis inhibitors acidification of the endosome can also affect endocytosis chloroquine an antimalarial drug can increase the intracellular ph by directing protons into the lysosomes57 it possesses broad-spectrum in vitro antiviral activities against flaviviruses hiv ebola nipah and numerous covs58 however it did not show activity in sars-cov-infected mice59 the anti-cov activity of different endocytosis inhibitors thus need further in vivo evaluation specific peptide inhibitors and monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies can be used to target the host receptor48 n-2-aminoethyl-1-aziridine-ethanamine a small-molecule inhibitor and synthetic ace2-derived peptides showed inhibition of ace2 activity and cell fusion via the s protein of sars-cov-1 in vitro6061 however these inhibitors have not been tested in cov patients monoclonal antibodies mabs such as anti-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp-4 have also been reported to block cell entry of mers-cov in vitro62 ys110 an anti-dpp4 recombinant humanized igg1 mab used in a phase i clinical trial was found to be well tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies19 however considering that host cell receptor usage differs in different covs the anti-cov activity of these agents may be narrow-spectrum further based on the vital biological functions of these receptors the risks of immunopathology such as blood pressure regulation glucose metabolism etc would need assessment52 camostat mesylate a synthetic serine protease inhibitor that is used to treat patients with chronic pancreatitis works against the serine protease tmprss26364 it has shown broad-spectrum activity against enveloped rna viruses such as covs and paramyxoviruses camostat mesylate is reported to inhibit sars and mers in ex vivo studies and improves the survival of mice infected with sars6465 nafamostat another serine protease inhibitor used to treat disseminated intravascular coagulation and pancreatitis blocked mers-cov infection by inhibiting tmprss2 in human airway epithelial calu-3 cells6566 though on viral infection suppression of the ifn response is an integral part for immune evasion several viruses and covs are noted to be susceptible to ifn treatment the effectiveness of recombinant ifn- over ifn- has been demonstrated by in vitro studies against both sars and mers67ifn- mediated reduction of viral titres was observed in sars-cov-infected in vivo models3559 while ifn- administration via different routes was found to be effective in mers-cov in vivo models26 combinations of ifn- ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir-boosted lopinavir for treatment of sarsmers patients demonstrated varying benefits333668 another type i ifn enhancer polyinosinic polycytidylic acid polyic a dsrna synthetic analogue demonstrated reduction in viral load in mers-cov-infected balbc mice69 in phase ii clinical trials poly ic was shown to be beneficial for patients suffering from malignant gliomas70 nitazoxanide a synthetic derivative of nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide which is used as a treatment for parasitic infections is an effective type i ifn inducer71 it has been shown to exhibit antiviral activities against several viral families and canine covs nitazoxanide was found to be safe in phase ii and iii clinical trials against hcv and influenza72 drugs interfering with the viral replication signaling pathways are noted to have broad spectrum activity against several viruses such as hcv hiv vesicular stomatitis virus human papilloma virus vaccinia virus and covs55 cyclosporine a calcineurin pathway inhibitor inhibited a broad range of covs in vitro by interacting with the nsp1 protein and modulating immune response mediated by t cells73 the clinical application of this drug is however restricted due to immune-suppressive effects and a higher ec50cmax ratio at standard dose levels other calcineurin inhibitors such as alisporivir have demonstrated activity against hcov-nl6320 the extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk pathway mediates intracellular signals from membrane-associated ras to the cytoplasmic kinase cascade raf mek and erk74 the kinase signaling pathway inhibitors such as trametinib mek inhibitor selumetinib erk inhibitor everolimus rapamycin dasatinib and imatinib have also demonstrated anti-cov effects through inhibition of early viral entry or post-entry events75 however their toxicities may be a concern in severe infections initiation of translation in many viruses happens through the usage of the host eukaryotic initiation factors eifs76 the helicase eif4a unwinds 5-untranslated region of the mrna facilitating assembly of the translation pre-initiation complexes a natural compound silvestrol being an inhibitor of eif4a and reported to show anti-cancer activity77 demonstrated inhibition of mers-cov and hcov-229e translation and replication in mrc-5 lung fibroblast cells78 comparison of the coding regions of sars-cov-2 showed that it possessed a similar genomic organization when compared to bat-sl-covzc45 and sars-cov-19 fig 2 sequence analysis further revealed good sequence identity with the bat and human covs in the different coding regions except for the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 that differs from the other covs including sars-cov-1 spike protein1379 the catalytic pockets in the major non-structural viral enzymes are conserved at both the sequence and protein structural level across covs hence repurposing of the promising mers and sars inhibitors for sars-cov-2 is a practical strategy16 in vitro evaluations to test the antiviral potency of marketed drugs ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine and broad-spectrum rdrp inhibitors remdesivir gs-5734 and favipiravir t-705 against sars-cov-2 were recently undertaken80 the findings have shown that remdesivir and chloroquine are more efficacious in comparison to the others a patient from usa with covid 2019 who was treated with remdesivir intravenously was reported to have recovered81 phase iii trials nct04252664 nct04257656 of intravenous remdesivir are currently ongoing to assess the efficacy in patients with sars-cov-2 chloroquine is under an open-label trial for sars-cov-2 chictr2000029609 in addition randomized clinical trials have been initiated for sars-cov-2 with favipiravir chictrchictr2000029544 chictr2000029600 and ribavirin in combination with pegylated ifn chictr2000029387 results following rapid sequencing of the sars-cov-2 combined with molecular modelling based on homologous templates82 have identified certain compounds along with lopinavir and ritonavir that may be efficacious phase iii clinical trials have also been initiated to test the hiv protease inhibitors including lopinavir nct04252274 nct04251871 nct04255017 chictr2000029539 ritonavir nct04251871 nct04255017 nct04261270 darunavir and cobicistat nct04252274 in patients infected with sars-cov-221 another hiv protease inhibitor asc09f in combination with oseltamivir is also in phase iii clinical trial for sars-cov-2 nct04261270 arbidol umifenovir a wide-spectrum antiviral drug inhibiting several flaviviruses and influenza viruses whose mechanism of action is based on blocking crucial steps in virus- host cell interactions83 is under phase iv clinical trial for sars-cov-2 nct04260594 nct04254874 nct04255017 oseltamivir an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor84 is also under phase iv trial for sars-cov-2 nct04255017 in the direction of host-based treatment strategies randomized trials are underway for sars-cov-2 using recombinant ifns nct04251871 chictr200002963819 in another study an artificial intelligence-based knowledge graph comprising systematically curated medical data was searched for approved drugs against sars-cov-285 baricitinib a janus kinase inhibitor that was consequently identified is a high-affinity ap2-associated protein kinase 1-binding drug which also interacts with a kinase regulator of endocytosis baricitinib has thus been suggested as a potential treatment for covid-19 disease as it has the ability to reduce viral infection in lung cells we analyzed the binding potential of hiv-1 protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritanovir against the 3clpro of sars-cov-2 using computational docking studies this would help gain insight into the molecular mode of action of these drugs which are under clinical trials against the sars-cov-2 and also estimate the comparative inhibitory potency of the fda-approved hiv protease inhibitors to the sars-cov-2 the mpro of covs cleaves substrates by recognizing the sequence motif small-x-lfm-qgas-x x  any amino acid  cleavage site and specifically the p1 site of the substrate requires a gln q8687 the x-ray structure of sars-cov-1 3clpro dimer bound with aza peptide epoxide ape as an inhibitor 2a5kpdb was used for the modelling studies the peptide showed major specificity to the s2 subsite and partial specificity to the s4 subsite of 3clpro12 we detached the ape from the crystal structure complex and re-docked it computationally using the same protocol as for the two selected study inhibitors to obtain the docking score and it was found to be 827 kcalmol the two inhibitors in this study had better binding potential fig 3 when compared to ape comparison of the docked poses reveals that lopinavir occupies the s1 and s1 subsites with excellent complementarity while ritanovir occupies the s3 and s4 subsites with excellent complementarity through the benzene and 2 isopropyl thiozole groups respectively these structural features indicate the possible mechanism by which these inhibitors can block the function of the sars-cov-2 3clpro the peptide substrate cleavage sites for sars-cov 3clpro are noted to be at p1 p1 and p3p48889 the occupancy at the respective active site cavities would be crucial for competitive inhibition of the polyprotein substrate based on this requirement the findings are suggestive that ritonavir and lopinavir may have good potential for repurposing as sars-cov-2 protease inhibitors molecular dynamics simulation studies for the complexes obtained in this study would be essential to identify specific interactions between the enzyme and drug in the stable complexes and observe the hydrogen bond pattern especially in the presence of solvent molecules additionally studies need to be undertaken for the binding analyses of the other protease inhibitors specific rdrp inhibitors and inhibitors of other enzymatic targets the results would help gain an in-depth understanding of the relative binding affinity and design of derivatives with greater binding potential at the enzyme active site this review presented the information with respect to repurposing of fda-approved drugs as well as those under clinical trials for sars-cov-1 and mers-covs wherein a lot of effort had gone in during the last decade or more this knowledge has in fact formed the basis for efforts towards drug repurposing for the sars-cov-2 as well as highlighted in this review phase iii clinical trials of a few drugs have been initiated though most of these are notably targeting the virus directly essentially the rdrp or the chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro the spike glycoprotein also needs be explored as a target for the sars-cov-2 as the s1 domain of this virus deviates from the other human covs it is thus important that the spike protein should be considered as a potential sars-cov-2 therapeutic target on the other hand considering that the strategy of targeting viral proteins is vulnerable to the emergence of viral resistance other coronavirus targets such as the papain-like protease helicase etc also need to be attempted for drug repurposing further several more of the potential sars andor mers host-based inhibitors should be assessed against sars-cov-2 the ongoing vigorous efforts would help develop broad-spectrum anti-cov agents against sars-cov-2  journal pre-proof current status of covid-19 therapies and drug repositioning applications ozlem altay elyas mohammadi simon lam hasan turkez jan boren jens nielsen mathias uhlen adil mardinoglu o altay e mohammadi s lam j  j uhlen m  a  mathias   uhlen  the rapid and global spread of a new human coronavirus sars-cov-2 has produced an immediate 18 urgency to discover promising targets for treatment of covid-19 drug repositioning is an attractive 19 approach that can facilitate the drug discovery process by repurposing existing pharmaceuticals to treat 20 illnesses other than their primary indications here we review current information concerning the global 21 health issue of covid-19 including promising approved drugs and ongoing clinical trials for prospective 22 treatment options in addition we describe computational approaches to be used in drug repurposing and 23 highlight examples of in-silico studies of drug development efforts against sars-cov-2  over the past few centuries outbreaks caused by bacteria like yersinia pestis and vibrio cholerae the 29 causative agents of plague and cholera respectivelycohn and kutalek 2016 pechous et al 2016 and 30 also by viral infectious agents such as influenza viruses ebolaviruses sars-cov-1 mers-cov the 31 zika virus and lately sars-cov-2 have undermined public trust in the ability for modern science to 32 predict and prevent global pandemic threats accordingly studying historical epidemics can help us 33 identify patterns of viral outbreaks and design a plan to prepare for next pandemic provide a better picture of statistics related to asymptomatic infections for epidemiologic analysis 59 the phylogeny virology and epidemiology of sars-cov-2 is being studied extensively at the genome 60 level sars-cov-2 has 795 homology to sars cov- cov-2 and other coronaviruses and its relative ease of sample acquisition and study it has been widely 75 accepted that drug repositioning is a promising approach to make available an effective safety-assured 76 treatment in a timely manner in this review we summarize diagnosis approaches risk groups available 77 treatment options and drug repositioning studies related to covid-19 78 prior to efficient treatment precise diagnosis and classification of patients based on disease severity and 80 their probable vulnerability to covid-19 is crucial diagnosis has several steps that can be prioritized 81 based on the provision of facilities during an outbreak generally evaluation of symptoms and particular 82 laboratory features that are associated with worse cases come first considering antihypertensive medications there are advocates for both use and cessation of consumption 108 it is still unclear whether the high mortality rate of patients with hypertension comorbidity is due to the 109 pathology of disorder or the treatment used to cure it such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 110 aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs ace2 has been shown to be a co-receptor for viral 111 entry and pathogenesis of sars-cov li et al 2003 there is considerable evidence which shows the 112 escalated expression level of ace2 in the heart brain and even in urine after treatment with arbs 113 however there is limited evidence showing changes in serum or pulmonary ace2 levels patel and 114 verma 2020 zhang et al 2020c in addition serological radiological and histo-morphological 115 similarities of covid-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and connective tissue 116 disease ctd-ild propose the postulation of triggering or simulating a form of organ-specific 117 autoimmunity in predisposed patients also some patients showed high titer antiphospholipid antibodies 118 including anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-2 glycoprotein antibodies zhang et al 2020d the 119 immunosuppressive therapy in identified patients with autoantibodies may prevent the development of 120 respiratory failure 121 with regard to treatment immunological and pharmaceutical investigations are still ongoing no specific 124 therapies for covid-19 is approved by us food and drug administration fda so far but many 125 previously approved drugs as an efficient approach to drug discovery named drug repurposing is being 126 tested on covid-19 at the time of writing 1137 interventional studies have been registered in 127 clinicaltrialsgov httpsclinicaltrialsgov related to covid-19 and this number is increasing 128 progressively table s1  in particular the ongoing clinical trials sponsored by who named solidarity 129 will compare different treatment options namely remdesivir lopinavirritonavir dual treatment 130 lopinavirritonavir dual treatment with interferon beta 1-alpha and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine 131 paused temporarily due to the concerns raised about the safety of the drug against standard of care as 132 of may 10 th 2020 more than 100 countries have been confirmed to contribute in this investigation 133 the interventional drugs in clinical trials can be classified based on their nature and complementary 134 effect in this regard antivirals antiparasitic drugs immunosuppressors immunomodulators some well-135 known drugs and nutritional drugs in addition to combination therapies are considered on ongoing 136 studies for treatment supportive care or prevention one can barely see the same mechanism of action 137 inside and outside each group table 1  but many drugs are discovered for a specific disease and 138 repurposed later for another disorder figure 2 illustrates a general path which is being traversed by 139 clinicians these days although the results may not be desirable in some cases due to the emergent nature 140 of sars-cov-2 in-silico drug repurposing methodologies have accelerated the studies in drug discovery through the use 250 of data mining approaches bioinformatics techniques and predictive models for determining the efficacy 251 and safety of the drugs however there is still a long way to reach the high success rates with repurposed 252 drugs eg repurposed candidates succeeded 9-67 -depending on the similarity between indicated and 253 repurposed therapeutic areas -and the novel molecular entity success rate is  10 and reduce the possibility of hypothesis risk will be essential to increase the success rate of repurposed 266 drugs in the product development process a computation-based methodology namely viral-track applied to bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 303 severe and mild covid-19 patients unveils a remarkable impact of the virus on the immune system of 304 severe patients compared to mild cases including

efforts on large-scale datasets will lead to reveal many 307 mechanistic aspects of viral infections yet to be resolved and will help to develop more efficient therapy 308 strategies 309 due to urgent

covid-19 world health emergency is calling scientists for unprecedented huge investigation efforts to urgently answer key questions what is the natural origin of the sars-cov-2 virus what molecular changes account for its aggressiveness and mortality in humans what immunological responses are specifically activated and how long will acquired immunity last in recovered people is there a most susceptible exposed population based on the genetic background are patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors at increased risk for covid-19 infection on top of these what are the best therapeutic options we have ready to help cure covid-19 patients with 15 of patients suffering from severe disease hospitals being overwhelmed worldwide and a global mortality rate of 57 1 it goes without saying that new efficacious treatments are immediately needed new interventional clinical trials for covid-19 treatment involve the use of an antiviral drug previously used to treat the ebola virus known as remdesivir or the combination of two antivirals ritonavir  lopinavir previously approved to treat the hiv infection additional active clinical trials involve the use of drugs approved for different therapeutic indications this is the case for example for i the fda-approved antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine owing to their ability to interfere with basic cellular pathogenetic mechanisms and ii monoclonal antibodies against interleukin-6 receptor anti-il-6r which might be helpful in reducing abnormal inflammatory response upon cytokine storm thus improving organ functions in covid-19 patients this recycling strategy based on the re-use of approved drugs is commonly referred to as drug repurposing and is largely successful as demonstrated by examples of repurposing treatments in cancer and other human diseases 2 drug repurposing is a modern therapeutic strategy that substantially reduces the risks of drug development and costs in this emergency it shortens the time gap between the identification of a potentially useful drug and the treatment of the patient owing to the availability of large amounts of safety tolerability pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic and clinical data on the existing drug indeed the use of a drug for a different therapeutic indication  also referred to as off-label use  can take advantage of phase iii trials for defining the potential maximum tolerated dose and predicting potential side effects or supportive therapies thus in the presence of preliminary clinical efficacy observations or a strong pharmacological rationale it is possible to immediately test existing drugs for novel therapeutic indication in human patients how can efficacious drug repurposing be reached drug repurposing is often the result of serendipity it might also result from an experimental drug screening or the identification of target similarities among different diseases or the involvement of common pathogenetic mechanisms among different diseases similarly to the scientific bases that motivated the above-described repurposing trials ongoing worldwide to cure covid-19 together with the current approaches there are multiple incisive investigation steps that can be immediately undertaken in the context of drug repurposing approaches to boost treatment strategies against covid-19 thanks to the availability of omics data and the implementation of biocomputational drug repurposing approaches in silico drug repurposing is a hypothesis-driven approach that takes advantage of the use of big data to identify drugs to treat disease or disease-related symptoms the process is based on the collection and coherent integration of disease data generated through omics studies followed by their combination with pharmacological data the ultimate goal is to integrate a disease network with a drugs mode of action network 3 in silico drug repurposing has the unique advantage to transform systems biology data of disease phenotypes and targets into a prediction of druggable targets and ideally to provide an fda-approved compound with potential modulatory andor inhibitory functions for an immediate preclinical or clinical test importantly data relevant to biological clinical features pharmacological responses drug targets and even drug off-targets can provide unexpected insights for understanding covid-19 pathology symptoms and possibly identifying treatments with these computational tools in hands theoretically  and with the obvious caution based on the predictive nature of this type of study  it could be possible to generate a hypothesis-driven computer-aided drug repurposing aimed to i reduce virus infection and its replication ii contrast the infections adverse symptoms iii understand positive or negative interactions among treatments iv identify mechanisms of the viral infections susceptibility and v predict potential side effects of treatments against antiviral immune response a fact that could eventually result in a worse clinical outcome the possibility to perform drug repurposing for each of the above-mentioned objectives is uniquely limited by the availability of data to generate computational modeling of the diseases relevant to each investigation direction as a first step for in silico drug repurposing against sars-cov-2 a computational modeling of viral pathogenesis and disease-related symptoms is necessary thanks to the release of the sars-cov-2 genome sequence 4 important biological information is already emerging phylogenetic studies have suggested the natural origin of sars-cov-2 and the highest nucleotide sequence identity 797 with sars-cov among the six other known pathogenic hcovs revealing the closest evolutionary relationship between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 4 similarly to sars-cov sars-cov-2 also uses the ace2 protein as a virus receptor 4 and can generate severe lung-associated diseases 5 these available data can be immediately used in biocomputational drug repurposing studies especially related to the mechanisms of hostvirus interaction and virus replication pending additional omics data on covid-19 pathogenesis disease modeling can also be generated using molecular data and studies that are already available on sars-cov because they are evolutionarily related viruses however the different mortality rates and the divergent molecular evolution clearly show that covid-19 is a unique peculiar disease this key aspect claims for caution about the interpretations of in silico drug-repurposing results obtained with the use of sars-cov-based studies from a methodological point of view many computational tools can be implemented based on different data types and methodologies data types include drug chemical structures physicochemical properties known molecular targets and omics data types such as drug-induced transcriptional responses or metabolic simulations methodologies range from classical statistical methods to modern machine learning techniques computational drug repurposing tools can be designed to directly attempt drug-repurposing predictions or to help in the process for example tools based on drugdisease association networks can immediately suggest novel clinical applications for similar disease phenotypes whereas chemical structure similarities can be exploited to prioritize alternatives to existing compounds 3 by contrast other computational tools can support the drug repurposing process providing biological insights into drug modes of action or discovering unknown molecular targets of existing drugs gene expression data can be used to characterize the effects of drug treatments for this reason a systematic collection of drug-induced whole-genome expression profiles has been produced in the past through the connectivity map cmap project and its latest release within the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs project a network-based analytical tool is needed to explore drug neighborhoods based on the similarity between induced transcriptional responses additional powerful computational tools such as predict sdtnbi chemmapper sider and drugbank will well-fulfil and implement hypothesis-driven drug repurposing 3 the number of studies on in silico drug repurposing against covid-19 is growing rapidly  among others worth citing is an interesting approach generating a systems-pharmacology-based network medicine platform that identified the interplay between the hcovhost interactome and drug targets in the human proteinprotein interaction network and that has identified potential drug repurposing treatments against such interactions 6 moreover a virtual screening approach was used to investigate the fda-approved lopac library and to predict drugs able to minimize the interaction between the viral spike s-protein and ace2 host cell receptor 7 in an additional report a novel deep learning platform was used to identify top potential inhibitors of the sars-cov-2 main protease by screening 13 billion compounds 8 these types of reports probably represent just a tip of the iceberg of ongoing drug repurposing investigations the results of which will appear in the coming weeks indeed the computer-aided battle against the virus has just started and it is also engaging the most powerful technological platforms to satisfy demands for massive amounts of computational capacity to this aim the recently launched covid-19 high-performance computing consortium in the usa will aggregate computing capabilities from the worlds most powerful and advanced computers to help covid-19 researchers execute complex computational research programs to help fight the virus 9 what other directions should researchers on in silico drug repurposing boost besides identifying novel hypothesis-driven drugs to treat covid-19 patients the computational approaches could also help a further understanding of currently used treatments for instance an antiviral inflammatory response network would help to better decipher key mechanisms involved in the response to anti-il-6r by taking advantage of large studies on inflammatory cytokines and available biomarkers similarly the inspection of the drugdrug network and side effects could predict whether a specific drug under or proposed for investigation would exacerbate any of the severe lung disease symptoms for instance it would be helpful to predict whether chloroquine potentially reducing infection efficacy could in turn affect the antiviral immune response or target pathways crucially implicated in chronic diseases of elderly patients if this is the case it could draw the attention on possible chloroquine off-targets and side effects in certain patients that would limit treatment benefits on patient survival finally in such a pandemic scenario in which medications against covid-19 become urgently needed in mass quantities and could face a shortage a computational drug repurposing approach might assist to quickly identify similar drugs with an analogous mode of action or to design alternative synthetic plans of a drug to overcome patented routes and to identify inexpensive and diverse starting materials once shortages of the commonly used substrates could occur 10 although timing for an efficacious vaccine remains uncertain a vibrant multidisciplinary research operation is already at work to provide immediate and concrete therapeutic options based on drug repurposing we hope to further inspire targeted computer-aided drug

and economically most consequential outbreaks in around 100 years 1 2 to date only remdesivir gilead sciences has shown to possibly lower the time to recovery 3 4 in the past developing antiviral agents has taken 59 years on average 5 in the current crisis it appears feasible that this timeline will be significantly reduced if there were early signs of efficacy moreover a candidate drug could be offered emergency use authorization by the us food and drug administration and similar designations by regulatory authorities across the world as was the case with remdesivir drug repurposing has been a successful strategy for a variety of therapeutic areas 6 in the case of covid-19 compounds of interest include those that have previously been found to either be clinically efficacious or have in vitro activity against the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers which share significant structural similarities with sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 7 8 information on drugs potentially active against covid-19 is expected to change rapidly as the results of ongoing and future studies become available it is crucial that both researchers and health care providers are able to access the optimum and most up-to-date information to inform future or ongoing studies and provide clinical care the objectives for the current protocol are 1 to systematically review which existing medications have shown to be potentially effective against sars or mers and could therefore be potentially repurposed 2 to present the early evidence that supports testing readily available drugs against sars-cov-2 3 to provide the best available level of evidence for the efficacy of each individual candidate drug and 4 to report

mild-to-moderate or severe disease in both outpatient and inpatient settings with the latter including intensive care unit icu and non-icu patients for clinical studies to be included participants must not just have symptoms compatible with covid-19 but either laboratory confirmation of infection of respective viruses - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 severe acute

in revman or stata sensitivity analysis based on the grade score will be undertaken if there is evidence of both high and low quality given that covid-19 will remain a substantial problem for the foreseeable future there will be an ongoing need to identify review and critically appraise 12 and synthesise new studies we aim to transform this project into a living systematic review 1316 we will combine all inputs from the literature databases and the preprint servers into one extensible markup language xml stream that we will be made publicly available as more controlled studies become available we aim to automate meta-analyses and inform stakeholders once the direction for effect of one of the studied drugs changes see below finally we will adapt and use methods from natural language processing and crowd-sourcing to support the review process learning from recently developed tools and processes 1719 we will make our methods and results open source and intend to crowd-source future review efforts which may alter the number of authors on review updates for permanency history will be kept and made permanently available via our website wwwcoviddrugsorg the completed review as well as intermittent updates eg when the number of included studies changes when a conclusion for any intervention changes or upon some other well-defined trigger will also be available via the preprint server medrxiv in summary this systematic review will summarize the emerging evidence on repurposed drugs for the treatment of covid-19 extrapolating from early evidence for covid-19 itself as well as sars and mers the protocol represents a rather generic approach to studying the potential treatment compounds identified in previous scoping review by the who except we will search pre-print servers the initial synthesis will occur rapidly and be more likely than not be qualitative at least while the evidence is sparse the present protocol was written in accordance with the prisma-p statement it is registered with prospero the quality of the evidence will be assessed using the grade approach the challenge posed by covid-19 however requires not just a rapid review of drugs that can be repurposed but also a sustained effort to integrate new evidence into a living systematic review the outlined approach should be particularly useful in prioritizing drug candidates finally future investigators could benefit from preliminary estimates of magnitudes of the effect of efficacious drugs for power and sample size calculations where appropriate and their study designs could be informed in terms of endpoints studied and adverse events monitored  identify potent sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors via accelerated free energy perturbation-based virtual screening of existing drugs zhe li xin li yi-you huang yaoxing wu runduo liu lingli zhou yuxi lin deyan wu lei zhang hao liu ximing xu kunqian yu yuxia zhang jun cui chang-guo zhan xin wang hai-bin luo  coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has become a global crisis there is no therapeutic treatment specific for covid-19 it is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against sars-cov-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and thus repurpose them for treatment of covid-19 in general a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease such as covid-19 usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs followed by experimental validation but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy fep-abfe predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting sars-cov-2 main protease m pro  the accurate fep-abfe predictions were based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution red function designed to accelerate the fep-abfe calculations and make the practical fep-abfe-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible for the first time as a result out of twenty-five drugs predicted fifteen were confirmed as potent inhibitors of sars-cov-2 m pro  the most potent one is dipyridamole ki004 m which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with covid-19 additionally hydroxychloroquine ki036 m and chloroquine ki056 m were also found to potently inhibit sars-cov-2 m pro for the first time we anticipate that the fep-abfe prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts  drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease such as covid-19 usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs followed by experimental validation but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods it has been demonstrated that a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy fep-abfe predictions can reach an unprecedently high hit rate leading to successful identification of 16 then m pro cleaves pp1a and pp1ab to release the functional proteins nsp4-nsp16 that are necessary for the viral replication 4 in view of the essential functions of m pro in the viral life cycle and its high level of conservation sars-cov-2 m pro is a naturally attractive target for treatment of covid-19 hence there have been efforts to identify therapeutic candidates targeting m pro using various virtual screening methods based on pharmacophore molecule docking and molecular simulations 5 as a result of the reported efforts six drugs were found to inhibit sars-cov-2 4 m pro with ic50 ranging from 067 to 214 m 5 there have been also drug repurposing efforts associated with other potential targets of sars-cov-2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 in general a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease such as covid-19 usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs through computational modeling and simulations followed by experimental validation however the actual hit rate of a virtual screening using traditional computational methods has been rather low with vast majority of computationally predicted drug candidates being false positives because it is difficult to reliably predict protein-ligand binding free energies most recently gorgulla et al 6 reported an interesting new virtual screening platform called virtualflow used to screen numerous compounds in order to identify inhibitors of kelch-like ech-associated protein 1 keap1 but the hit rate was still not very high within 590 compounds predicted by the virtual screening 69 were found to be keap1 binders with a hit rate of 117 for detectable binding affinity and 10 of these compounds were confirmed to be displacers of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2related factor 2 nrf2 with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration ic50  60 m with a hit rate of 14 under the threshold of ic50  60 m6 obviously the hit rate of a virtual screening is dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the receptor-ligand binding free energy predictions used in the virtual screening process so the key to the success of a virtual screening effort is use of a reliable computational approach to accurately predict binding free energies the free energy perturbation fep simulation of intermolecular interactions 7 8 is recognized a reliable method for binding free energy calculations with satisfactory accuracy 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 but the traditional fep method was limited to simulating some minor structural changes of ligands for the relative binding free energy rbfe calculations 9 19 the rbfe calculations can be used to guide lead optimization starting from a promising lead compound or hit9 19-22 but 5 not suitable for virtual screening of completely different molecular structures to identify new hits for drug repurposing for the virtual screening to identify new hits or leads it is necessary to predict absolute binding free energy abfe for each ligand binding with the target without the requirement to use any reference ligand structure the fep-abfe approach has the advantage of predicting binding affinities between ligands and their targets more accurately than conventional computational methods such as pharmacophore molecule docking and molecular simulations 23 however the previously used fep-abfe calculations are extremely expensive and timeconsuming and thus not suitable for virtual screening purposes that required to screen a large number of compounds 24 25 to make the fep-abfe approach practically feasible for our virtual screening and drug repurposing effort here we report a new algorithm using a restraint energy distribution red function to accelerate the fep-abfe prediction and its first application to a drug repurposing effort which targets sars-cov-2 m pro  our fep-abfe prediction-based virtual screening which predicted 25 drugs as potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 m pro  was followed by in vitro activity assays confirming that 15 out of the 25 drugs can potently inhibit sars-cov-2 m pro with 004 to 33 m with a remarkably high hit rate of 60 under a threshold of ki  4 m nine drugs have ki  1 m with a submicromolar hit rate of 36 particularly among these drugs the most potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 m pro is dipyridamole dip ki  004 m following the computational prediction and in vitro activity validation dip was tested for its antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro and in clinical studies for treatment of patients with covid-19 and the preliminary clinical data are promising for its actual therapeutic effects while the clinical data are reported separately elsewhere 26 to timely guide further clinical studies and possibly practical clinical application we describe and discuss in this report the detailed computational and in vitro activity 6 results of dip along with other promising drugs identified the encouraging outcomes suggest that the fep-abfe prediction-based virtual screening is a truly promising approach to drug repurposing prior to the virtual screening for drug repurposing the accuracy of the accelerated fep-abfe prediction protocol was validated by using three different protein targets brd4 hiv-1 protease and human factor xa and 28 ligands with diverse chemical scaffolds according to the validation data given in supporting information si section s7 the accelerated fep-abfe algorithm can achieve a high accuracy for the abfe predictions so in order to identify potent sars-cov-2 m pro inhibitors we first carried out the fep-abfe based virtual screening of all existing drugs followed by in vitro activity assays as shown in figure 1  specifically after all the existing drugs were docked into the binding site of sars-cov-2 m pro  100 molecules that had specific interactions with the six key amino acid residues cys145 his41 ser144 his163 gly143 and gln166 were subjected to further fep-abfe calculations among these 100 drugs 49 46 and 5 were electrically neutral negatively charged and positively charged respectively since the fep method is known to encounter systematic errors when the ligands are not electrically neutral the drugs selected on the basis of the fep-abfe results were grouped by their formal charges to ensure that the error is cancelled within each group in each group the top 20 to 40 of the molecules were selected based on their abfe values as a result 25 drugs were selected for subsequent in vitro experimental activity testing according to the in vitro results 15 out of these 25 drugs exhibited considerable potency of inhibiting sars-cov-2 m pro figures 2 and s8  dip was found to be the most potent inhibitor with ki  004 m following the computational prediction and in vitro activity confirmation dip was further tested for its antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 demonstrating that dip dose-dependently suppressed the sars-cov-2 replication with ec50  01 m the antiviral activity was consistent with the inhibitory activity against m pro  in addition dip was also tested clinically in treatment of patients with covid-19 resulting in promising therapeutic data that are reported separately elsewhere along with the raw antiviral activity data 26 due to the urgent need of further clinical studies and possibly practical clinical application the fep-abfe results calculated for all the confirmed potent sars-cov-2 m pro inhibitors are given in table 1 in comparison with the subsequently determined experimental activity data 8 as seen in table 1 a ki values for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were determined using the dixon plots using the data in figure 3 notably candesartan cilexetil with ki  018 m against sars-cov-2 m pro is a prodrug for its labeled use treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure hence we also computationally and experimentally examined its metabolite candesartan the active drug corresponding to the prodrug for the labeled use which was not in the drug library screened interestingly candesartan was also predicted and confirmed as a potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 m pro  with a slightly lower inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 m pro ki  062 m so it is interesting to note that for potential treatment of patients with covid-19 the prodrug candesartan cilexetil would serve as a more active molecular species against sars-cov-2 m pro compared to candesartan itself table 1  31 32 hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and indinavir were reported to be active in vitro against covid-19 but their molecular targets were not reported 27 28 29 montelukast sodium and maribavir was only predicted by calculations 29 30 without experimental activity data reported disulfiram served as the positive control for the in vitro activity its ic50 value is 572 m in the literature and 47 m in this work when the concentration of the same substrate used was as high as 20 m notably in summary the virtual screening through accelerated fep-abfe predictions has demonstrated an excellent accuracy with a remarkably high hit rate of 60 under a threshold of ki  4 m we anticipate that the fep-abfe prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts the accelerated fep-abfe approach was based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution in si section s1 the

1
 points to the urgent need for therapies against emerging new viruses as there is currently no vaccine nor effective antiviral therapy for sarscov2 innovative approaches need to be developed rapidly the repurposing of existing drugs which are currently used or have been used against other diseases represents a potential fast track to effective clinical treatment largescale and hypothesisfree drug screening against viral infections can be costly and time consuming and therefore targeted strategies are more suitable however a major difficulty is often the limited amount of information about the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenicity of a virus when a new outbreak starts viruses are cellular parasites that infect eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and hijack their cellular machinery to replicate themselves before being released to further infect neighboring cells and eventually other organisms the first step in viral infection is the attachment of the virus to the plasma membrane and its entry into the cell which is followed by intracellular viral replication and finally the release of the newly formed viruses with regard to covid19 it is known that the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 provides the cell membrane receptor entry point for sarscov2
2
 
3
 
4
 the structurefunction relationships and antigenicity of the viral sarscov2 spike glycoprotein have also been established
4
 the structural basis for the attachment of sarscov2 to the cell membrane is the binding of the receptor binding domain rbd of the surface spike glycoprotein s protein of sarscov2 to ace2 as revealed by xray crystallography
5
 in addition it has also been shown that sarscov2 uses the transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 for s protein priming cleavage of the fusion domain and the inhibition of tmprss2 by a clinically approved inhibitor might block further infection
3
 such narratives are currently developing it is still early and these initial findings obviously do not preclude the identification of other molecular partners involved in the entry and replication of sarscov2 in human cells growth factor receptors gfrs are transmembrane proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells and whose primary function is to bind to extracellular polypeptide growth factors the binding of specific growth factors to gfrs results in the activation of their intracellular protein kinase domain that initiates a cascade of signaling events ultimately leading to the regulation of cell growth interestingly gfrs have also been identified as necessary for the entry of some viruses including coronaviruses and gfr signaling is involved in viral replication in many instances drugs targeting gfrs and their signaling are currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of cancer and given the role of gfrs in virus entry and replication these drugs could potentially be repurposed against viral infections in this article the evidence for the link between viral infection and gfrs will be reviewed and the value of repurposing current oncologic drugs targeting gfrs in order to expand effective antiviral strategies including in the fight against covid19 will be discussed in multicellular organisms such as the human body growth factors and gfrs are essential during embryogenesis and postnatal development because they orchestrate cell survival proliferation migration and differentiation in all tissues and organs in the adult body gfrs are involved in the control of cellular turnover and homeostasis as well as in tissue repair and regeneration and their deregulation can lead to cancer nerve growth factor ngf and epidermal growth factor egf were the first growth factors to be identified leading to the award of the 1986 nobel prize in physiology and medicine to stanley cohen and rita levimontalcini
6
 
7
 subsequently the receptor for egf egfr was characterized and shown to be a transmembrane receptor with an intracellular tyrosine kinase activity that initiates a cascade of downstream protein phosphorylation when it is engaged by egf
6
 as more growth factors were identified a complex picture of associated gfrs emerged to date more than 20 families of gfrs have been described and as initially reported for egfr most gfrs exhibit a tyrosine kinase activity
8
 the only notable exception being the receptors for members of the transforming growth factor betas tgfbrs which exhibit a serinethreonine kinase activity
9
 most tyrosine kinase gfrs activate the same set of intracellular kinases including but not limited to src akt pi3pk and ultimately the map kinases all of which translocate into the nucleus to regulate gene expression
8
 in contrast the serinethreonine kinase activity of tgfbrs ultimately leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of members of the smad transcription factor family

 there are three common characteristics shared by most gfrs a virtually ubiquitous localization throughout tissues and organs the existence of multiple gfrs genesproteins within the same family and the wide range of cellular effects induced by the same gfrs this is well illustrated by the receptors for the fibroblast growth factors fgfrs there are four different fgfrs fgfrs14 genes generating seven isoforms all are expressed in most human cell types and upon ligand binding the resultant stimulation of their tyrosine kinases induces a wide range of cellular effects including cell proliferation in epithelial cells and fibroblasts the migration of endothelial cells as well as the differentiation of neurons and their subsequent neurite outgrowth notably the activity of fgfrs is also coregulated by a class of unbranched glycosaminoglycans the heparan sulfates hs which are abundant on both the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix hss make many fgffgfr interactions much more efficient by crossbinding them into trimeric complexes thus facilitating the activation of fgfrs and their downstream signaling pathways
10

 as early as 1978 it was reported that the growth of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1 in human fibroblasts could be altered by egf
11
 but the relationship between egf and viral infection was not understood as a result the crosstalk between egfr and viral protein synthesis was explored but it was not until 2011 that the egfr was shown to be the cofactor responsible for the entry of hepatitis c virus hcv into human cells
12
 this study demonstrated that egfrs and the epha2 tyrosine kinase receptors together mediate hcv entry by regulating cd81claudin1 coreceptor association and thus viral glycoproteindependent membrane fusion this study was also the first to show that tyrosine kinase inhibitors can have substantial antiviral activity
12
 in turn the hcv upregulates egfr activation which favors further viral entry
13
 the involvement of egfrs with virus internalization and transport to the endosomal network was further confirmed in the case of hepatitis b virus hbv
14
 
15
 as well as for gastroenteritis viruses
16
 
17
 the vaccinia virus vacv has also been shown to coopt egfr signaling to enhance virus spread through the stimulation of cell motility that contributes to the rapid spread of infection
18
 significantly many respiratory viruses have been shown to induce egfr activation leading to suppressed interferon regulating factor1 irf1dependent interferon  and thus lowered antiviral defense in airway epithelium
16
 
19
 thus egfrs are not only portals for virus entry but are also involved in the suppression of the immune response of the host the overactivation of egfrs could also result in other longterm issues for patients affected by respiratory viruses as was shown with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus egrf overactivation leads to increased pulmonary fibrosis
20
 it is therefore tempting to hypothesize that egfr inhibition might also reduce the risk of further pulmonary fibrotic damage after coronavirus infection the first study demonstrating a role for fgfrs in viral infection reported that they were a portal of cellular entry for the herpes simplex virus type 1 and presumed it was through the binding of fgf to the viral particle and presentation to the receptors
21
 
22
 however a subsequent and contradictory study found that fgfrs were not required for herpes simplex virus type 1 infection
23
 but that fgfbinding heparan sulfates hs on the cell surface and in the pericellular space were involved instead
24
 it is now well established that hs is essential to the interaction of hsbinding fgfs with fgfr because it creates a trimolecular fgfhsfgfr complex that subsequently triggers fgfr activation
9
 and such a scenario resolved the initially conflicting results fgfr1 was then shown to be a coreceptor for infection by adenoassociated virus 2
25
 fgfr signaling also accompanies zika virus infection in human fetal brain
26
 using an integrative systems approach based on genomewide rna interference screening fgfrs were found to be cofactors required for earlystage influenza virus replication
27
 a reciprocal effect of fgfr signaling has also been reported for the dengue virus with the inhibition of fgfrs reducing virus rna replication while increasing viral particle production
28

 similar to the case of egfrs fgfr activation may trigger longterm consequences for virus infected patients the activation of the fgfr1 signaling pathway by epsteinbarr virusencoded lmp1 promotes aerobic glycolysis and ultimately the cancerous transformation of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells
29
 taken together as fgfrs and heparan sulfates participate in viral infection the data strongly suggest they could potentially be targeted to inhibit virus development supporting this contention the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov a close relative to sarscov2 is known to induce lung cell apoptosis that results in major lung damage by upregulating fgf2
30

 as well as facilitating fgfr activation the hs complexed into proteoglycan complexes to form hspgs represent a separate entry point for viruses into human cells this was first shown for the herpes simplex virus whose initial interaction with cells is via binding to cell surface hspgs
31
 
32
 there is now abundant evidence that coronaviruses use hspgs to attach to the plasma membrane before internalization with the first demonstrations provided for a murine coronavirus
33
 and an avian bronchitis coronavirus
34
 similarly the human coronavirus nl63 also utilizes such hspgs for attachment to target nasopharyngeal cells
35
 
36
 interestingly a sars virus variant has also been shown to utilize hspg for cell entry which can be competitively inhibited by lactoferrin
37
 together these data on coronaviruses suggest that sarscov2 is also likely to bind to hspg preliminary data have recently been released that reinforce this hypothesis
38
 in this study the authors used surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the sarscov2 spike s1 protein receptor binding domain sarscov2 s1 rbd and heparin
38
 the data strongly suggested an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain of the virus and hs the therapeutic targeting of hspgs thus appears a relatively straightforward way to inhibit the infectivity of sarscov2 tgfbrs have not been reported as a cellular entry point for viruses however tgfbr stimulation appears to regulate viral replication it was initially shown that tgfbr stimulation resulted in the suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv expression and replication
39
 the same inhibitory effect of tgfbrs was found with hcv
40
 in contrast tgfbrs enhance respiratory syncytial virus rsv replication in epithelial cells
41
 via reduction of hepatocyte nuclear factor4a expression
42

 of note the mers coronavirus induces apoptosis in lung cells by upregulating smad7 a key protein involved in tgfbr signaling
30
 the nucleocapsid of the coronavirus sarscov interacts with smad3 to modulate tgfbr signaling resulting in the promotion of lung fibrosis
43
 and possible longterm deleterious effects for patients there is less information on the role of other classes of gfrs in virus infection the hepatocyte growth factor receptor hgfr is a known coreceptor for cell entry of adenoassociated virus type 2 infection
44
 pharmacological inhibition of the ngf receptor trka has been shown to suppress influenza virus replication
45
 ngf stimulates hiv1 replication in primary macrophages by signaling through trka with the involvement of reticular calcium protein kinase c extracellular signalregulated kinase p38 kinase and nuclear factorb
46
 ngfinduced enhancement of hiv1 replication occurs during the late events of the hiv1replicative cycle with a concomitant increase in viral transcription and production
46
 similarly it has been shown that human rhinoviruses hrv upregulate the ngftrka pathway in airway epithelial cells which in turn amplifies viral replication by increasing hrv entry via icam1 receptors and by limiting apoptosis of nasopharyngeal cells
47
 
48
 recent evidence suggests that the influenza virus uses the gm3enhanced plateletderived growth factor receptor beta pdgfrb signaling pathway for cell penetration
49
 this study also reported that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ki8751 disrupts the endocytotic process of influenza a and b viruses induced by pdgfrb
49
 importantly the tyrosine kinase ephrin receptor a2 has been reported to participate in hcv entry
12
 and is also an epithelial receptor for epsteinbarr virus ebv entry into epithelial cells thus increasing the risk of malignancy
50
 
51

 these have been developed specifically to bind to the extracellular domain of gfrs to block ligand binding and thereby inhibit receptor dimerization autophosphorylation and downstream signaling
52
 trastuzumab also called herceptin a humanized mab was the first gfrtargeted drug to be introduced into oncology and is routinely used to treat breast cancers overexpressing the egfr family member her2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 also called erbb2
53
 patients overexpressing her2 classically have a poor prognosis but since the introduction of trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy this situation has completely changed her2positive patients now have a survival rate similar to median breast cancer survival rates
53
 in terms of side effects when compared to chemotherapy trastuzumab is well tolerated other mabs against egfr such as cetuximab and panitumumab are also used clinically particularly for colorectal cancer and head and neck cancers given the reported involvement of egfrs for cellular entry and replication of many viruses mabs against egfrs are clearly worthy of further testing not only against newly emerging viruses but also against sarscov2 itself tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis bind to atpbinding pockets located within the intracellular catalytic kinase domain of tyrosine kinase gfrs so blocking the activation of downstream signaling they are also frontline targeted therapies for the treatment of several cancer types they thus hold potential interest for drug repurposing against viruses tkis were first developed to target egfr family members and they were the first to enter clinical use in oncology
54
 firstgeneration egfr tkis such as gefitinib and erlotinib reversibly bind to egfrs thereby improving the survival of patients with lung cancer which harbor egfractivating mutations
55
 secondgeneration egfr tkis such as afatinib and dacomitinib irreversibly bind to such receptors and show an increased cellular potency against egfr oncogenic variants
56
 several antigfr tkis including those targeting more specifically her2 trka and pdgfr have already been shown to block multiple steps of the replication of both influenza virus
45
 and dengue virus
57
 evidently such encouraging results should prompt further testing against emerging coronavirus species hss found on the cell surface and as part of the extracellular matrix are essential to the activation of several gfrs mostly by virtue of their facilitation of growth factor binding structurally very close to the native ecm glycosaminoglycan hs is the variant heparin one of the most widely used drugs in the world heparin and its derivatives are clinically approved as anticoagulantsantithrombotics with wellknown bioavailability albeit with a tight safety window not all heparin derivatives have anticoagulant activity importantly heparin has been shown to have a broad spectrum of activity against many viruses including zika
58
 and hiv1
59
 presumably through a competitively inhibitive process between it and cellular hs whereby an excess of heparin prevents a virus from binding to cell surface hs because coronaviruses have been shown to bind to hs to enter target cells
35
 
36
 it can be hypothesized that heparin should act to prevent cell attachment of sarscov2 preliminary data have indicated that indeed heparin does bind to the surface protein spike s1 of this virus
38
 and may therefore be therapeutic for covid19 the literature described herein emphasizes the pivotal involvement of gfrs and coreceptors such as hspgs in viral entry and replication in the face of the current lack of a vaccine or other effective therapies for the treatment of emerging viral diseases such as covid19 with their dramatic health and economic consequences the targeting of gfrs using existing oncologic drugs represents an intriguing opportunity given the rapidity of covid19 spread throughout the world drug repurposing offers a fast track for the introduction of therapies using known clinically approved molecules the value of drug repurposing to fight sarscov2 is well illustrated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine an inexpensive drug with low toxicity that has been used for more than 60 years for the treatment of malaria it has shown promising effects in reducing the viral load and the duration of infection in initial clinical trials involving patients with covid19
60
 
61
 interestingly chloroquine is known to inhibit the activation of mitogenactivated protein kinases mapks which are activated by gfrs
62
 for the hcov229 coronavirus chloroquineinduced virus inhibition occurs via its inhibition of mapk
63
 suggesting that mapkactivating gfrs are involved although at this stage it has not yet been demonstrated that gfrs are involved in sarscov2 cell entry and replication the current knowledge about the role of gfrs in other viral infections including other coronaviruses constitutes a rational basis to begin testing the value of repurposed antigfrs drugs against emerging viral diseases and covid19 in particular the authors declare no conflicts of interest  virtual screening and repurposing of fda approved drugs against covid-19 main protease mahmoud kandeel mohammed al-nazawi   recently a severe and highly contagious viral disease was evolved in wuhan china 1 the causative agent was detected to be a new coronavirus and termed as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 coronavirus has been associated with several infectious epidemics with major health hazard concerns in 20002004 the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars cov was evolved 2 the source of the infection was recorded from animal origins including a bat as an intermediate host 3 about a decade later the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov was diagnosed in saudi arabia 4 soon after the emergence of sars and mers covs they spread to outside of the countries of its origin causing major world-wide concerns 56 lastly covid-19 emerged in wuhan china the first isolation was related to an animal market and human-to-human transmission was recorded 7 the coronavirus polyprotein encodes two proteases which share in its processing and release of the translated non-structural proteins nsps the main protease is called 3-c-like protease m-pro and a papain-like protease plpro 8 both plpro and mpro were vital targets for drug discovery studies against the recent coronavirus epidemics including sars and mers cov 9 10 11 12 the first and the only available crystal structure of covid-19 proteins is mpro which was published in february 2020 pdb id 6lu7 in this study the first virtual screening study against the first known covid-19 was performed the obtained results will help in the repurposing of already approved drugs to combat the recent dangerous covid-19 the ncbi genbank or gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg were used to obtain the covid-19 sequences sars cov and mers cov sequences were obtained from the genbank pairwise and multiple sequence comparisons of mpro were done using clc genomics software qiagen inc usa the sequence comparison matrix was generated including the number of gaps number of different residues and identity  the aligned sequences file was used to generate a phylogenetic tree by using the neighbor joining method implemented in clc genomics workbench software fda approved drugs dataset was retrieved from selleckchem inc wa usa all compounds were imported to ligprep software deslated and 3d optimized using opls2005 force field virtual screening was implemented by using the published crystal structure of covid-19 mpro pdb id 6lu7 the protein preparation module in maestro software package schrodinger llc ny usa was used to optimize the protein structure for docking water and other nonspecific molecules were removed the protein was protonated to add polar hydrogens the structure was optimized at cellular ph conditions and the structure energy minimized using opls2005 force field the docking grid was generated by using the co-crystalised ligand as the center for docking box of 20  size the schrodinger glide docking module was used for virtual screening in order to get accurate results the standard precision sp docking was selected 2728 the output results were ordered by docking score in this set the curcumin was found to be a strong inhibitor of sars mpro 13 the measured ic50 was 00235 m the obtained docking results were reanalyzed to include a comparison with curcumin the relative docking scores were calculated for every compound by dividing its score with the docking score curcumin molecular modeling virtual screening and other computational techniques are widely used methods to understand the phylogenetics molecular aspects of proteins and protein-ligand interactions during drug discovery process 14 15 16 17 18 virtual screening has been used in drug discovery against emerging and fatal diseases including sars cov proteases 1920 hepatitis c virus rna-dependent rna polymerase 21 dengue virus 22 and ebola virus 23 in this work we cover a knowledge gap about the covid-19 mpro and its comparison with the two most dangerous coronavirus epidemics sars and mers covs in addition we used the first resolved covid-19 crystal structure of mpro to find suitable binding agents with proved safety in this context the fda approved drugs were the best starting point in the way of repurposing approved and safe drugs against covid-19 at first the mpro from covid-19 was compared with sars and mers covs fig 1
 comparing covid-19 mpro with sars mpro fig 1a and mers cov mpro fig 1b revealed high degree of conservation between covid-19 and sars cov mpros and little number of different residues however mers cov mpro showed large number of differences and low conservation with covid-19 mpro this was evidenced by the phylogenetic relations fig 1c which showed close relation of sars and covid-19 mpros and distant relation to mers cov statistics of sequences comparison was generated in a pairwise sequence comparison matrix table 1
 there was 9608 identity between covid-19 and sars cov mpro while low identity of 5161 was detected for covid-19 and mers cov mpro the number of covid-19 amino acid differences was 12 and 153 for sars cov and mers cov respectively the results of virtual screening of fda approved drugs against covid-mpro is presented in supplementary table 1 the presented parameters include the docking scores ligand efficiency lipophilic and hydrogen bonding interactions the top 20 hits showing the highest docking score are provided in table 2 the data were presented as a relative value to curcumin a previously approved sars mpro inhibitor curcumin docking score was ranked at the 334 position implying the presence of wide range of expected more powerful binding drugs within the top 20 drugs there was 2 antivirals 2 antituberculous agents 2 vitamins 1 anticancer and other miscellaneous systemically acting drugs 
among antivirals ribavirin and telbivudine were ranked at the second and third positions they showed 2 folds increase in the docking scores compared with curcumin vitamin b12 and nicotinamide were ranked at the 4th and 6th positions ribavirin is abroad spectrum antiviral agent acting by induction of mutations in the viral genome especially in rna viruses 24 ribavirin is officially approved for treating respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection and in combination with interferon 2b for hepatitis c virus 25 in addition it was used for treating sars cov infections 25 given the high similarity of sars and covid-19 mpros ribavirin might be of a value in treating covid-19 telbivudine is approved for treating hepatitis b virus 26 the drug is nucleoside analogue and best fits the viral polymerase the high rank of telbivudine in this study suggests its repurposing for covid-19 treatment by its binding to mpro in comparison with curcumin the top 10 ranked compounds showed improved hydrogen bonding profile there was 1697 fold increase in hydrogen bonding interactions in contrast the hydrophobic interactions were kept constant or lowered by inspection of the binding mode of top ranked drugs hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were the driving force for binding fig 2
 ribavirin formed two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of thr25 and side chain of gln189 fig 2b and c telbivudine formed two hydrogen bonds with ser49 and glv189 fig 2d and e in conclusion molecular modeling tools were used to compare the mpro of the recently evolved covid-19 and the previous two coronavirus epidemics sars and mers cov covid-19 mpro was more phylogenetically related to sars mpro after a virtual screening capmain against covid-19 mpro a set of antivirals vitamins antimicrobials and other systemically acting drugs were more potent binding with covid-19 mpro compared with curcumin known mpro inhibitor the repurposing of ribavirin telbivudine vitamin b12 and nicotinamide is suggested the following is the supplementary data related to this article
  virtual screening of plant metabolites against main protease rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 therapeutics option of covid-19 virtual screening of plant metabolites against main protease rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 therapeutics option of covid-19 sorwer alam parvez 1amp kazi azim faizul abdus shukur imran topu raihan aklima begum tasfia saiyara shammi sabbir howlader farhana bhuiyan rumzum mahmudul hasan  covid-19 a serious respiratory complications caused by sars-cov-2 has become one of the global threat to human healthcare system the present study evaluated the possibility of plant originated approved 117 therapeutics against the main protease protein mpp rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and spike protein s of sars-cov-2 including drug surface analysis by using molecular docking through drug repurposing approaches the molecular interaction study revealed that rifampin -163 kcalmol were topmost inhibitor of mpp where azobechalcone were found most potent plant therapeutics for blocking the rdrp -159 kcal mol and s -144 kcalmol protein of sars-cov-2 after the comparative analysis of all docking results azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were exhibited as the most potential inhibitory plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of sars-cov-2 however amino acid positions h41 c145 and m165 of mpp played crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where f368 l371 l372 a375 w509 l514 y515 were pivotal for rdrp in addition the drug interaction surface of s proteins also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum inhibitors adme analysis also strengthened the possibility of screened plant therapeutics as the potent drug candidates against sars-c with the highest drug friendliness  covid-19 pandemic situation has tremendously turned the entire world into a place of horrible death tragedy sars-cov-2 initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by the world health organization who is the causative agent of the recent serious respiratory complications resulting the covid-19 pandemic 1 2 3 4  though the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 52 days the period from the onset of covid-19 symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days with a median of 14 days 5 6  it has already completed its world tour and around 213 countries are now experiencing the deadly scene occurred by covid-19 including 41 52670 infected patients and 2 84536 global death cases till 12th may 2020 7  the scientific community is racing to explore the effective remedy against this severe health complications but till to date there are no any potential therapeutics have been approved for clinical use 8  there have been few key proteins of sars-cov-2 that could be targeted as the vaccine or drug surface 9  similar to sars and mers non-structural proteins eg 3-chymotrypsin-like protease coronavirus main protease papain-like protease helicase and rna-dependent rna polymerase structural proteins eg spike glycoprotein and accessory proteins were investigated in the genome of sars-cov-2 where non-structural proteins constitute two-thirds of the entire genome 10  among the structural proteins nucleocapsid n protein is prerequisite for rna genome assembly where membrane m and envelope e proteins are associated in viral assembly in the host environment 11  moreover spike s protein is mainly responsible for the viral entry into the host cell and that is why spike protein is now being considered as a major therapeutic target for drug and vaccines against sars-cov-2 12  again the s protein interaction with the human ace2 interface has been revealed at the atomic level and the efficiency of ace2 usage was found to be a main factor of coronavirus transmissibility in human to human 13  on the contrary coronavirus main protease m pro or 3c-like proteinase 3clp was reported for their ability to cleave the polyproteins into individual polypeptides that are required for replication and transcription 14  the 3clp is autocleaved initially from the polyproteins to become a mature enzyme leading the translation of the messenger rna 15  then the 3clp cleaves all the 11 downstream non-structural proteins as 3clp plays a vital role in the replication cycle of virus in the host it has been reported as the attractive target against the human sars virus 16  rna-dependent rna polymerase other key target protein of sars-cov-2 catalyses the synthesis of viral rna possibly with the support of other non-structural proteins as co-factors 17 18 19  the computational drug repurposing method could allow the immediate search of potential antiviral therapy in case of re-emergence of viral infections as like as covid-19 pandemic situation 20 21 22  computational drug repurposing has already been used to identify promising drug candidates for other virus associated diseases like dengue ebola zika and influenza infections 23 24  most importantly the sars-cov-2 has shown evolutionary convergent relations with sars-cov and mers-cov and the drug repurposing methods were also applied to sars-cov and mers-cov 25 26 27  hence extensive in silico studies were performed to identify potential drug candidates for example prulifloxacin bictegravir nelfinavir and tegobuvi were identified as repurposing candidates against covid-19 by looking for drugs with high binding capacity with sars-cov main protease 28  again nelfinavir an hiv-1 protease inhibitor was also predicted to be a potential inhibitor of covid-19 main protease by another computational-based study 29  however secondary metabolites from plant origin are found to show effective defence mechanism against different deadly pathogens and they have been widely used for conventional remedy to treat a wide range of human diseases since the ancient period of human civilization 30 31 32  in this pandemic situation researchers are trying find out the effective solution against covid-19 where plant metabolites could be a promising wings for screening out potential drug candidates even few plant secondary metabolites have already been reported as effective against other coronaviruses 33 34  in the present study a total of 117 plant based drug compound were screened out to check their potentiality for blocking the three important key proteins of sars-cov-2 the main protease proteins rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 were employed to molecular docking study with the repurposed drug candidates from plant origin for find out the better drug option towards the covid-19 pandemic protein and acquisition of potential natural therapeutics pdb structures of sars-cov-2 main protease proteins 6lu7 6y2e rna-dependent rna polymerase 6m71 and spike protein 6vyb were retrieved from rcsb protein data bank 35  moreover a total 117 plant based drugs were collected from pubchem database supplementary table   1  alpha-ketoamide cid 6482451 were also retrieved from the pubchem database database httpspubchemncbinlmnihgov of ncbi 36  molecular docking is an effective approach for screening out potential therapeutics against specific drug-targets of deadly pathogens 37 38  the crystal structure of retrieved sars-cov-2 proteins complexed with inhibitors were refined by pymol v20 software 39  unwanted molecules ie water ions inhibitors were removed from the viral retrieved viral protein and further employed to molecular docking experiment with 117 natural therapeutics autodock vina software 40 to analyse the binding affinity and interactive amino acids alpha-ketoamide an inhibitor sars-cov-2 main protease protein were used as a positive control in this study 41 and also docked against the target proteins of sars-cov-2 the default parameters for grid box were set to 62 a x 71 a x 60 a x y and z and center -25389 a x 15333 a x 56865 a x y and z to perform the action moreover 2d ligand-protein interaction diagrams were generated by ligplot find out the involved amino acids with their interactive position were identified in the docked complexes 42  the ligand molecules interactions with the viral proteins were visualize and analyzed by discovery studio 43 and pymol v20 software 44  the drug surface hotspot of sars-cov-2 proteins were identified by analysing the docked structures of each protein with the top most natural therapeutics by ligplot pymol v20 and discovery studio software binding patterns of azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine fangchinoline with sars-cov-2 proteins and the results were allowed for the comparative structural analysis of screened natural therapeutics furthermore interactions of alpha-ketoamide with the studied proteins were also investigated the adme absorption distribution metabolism and excretion properties of top drug candidates were analysed by swissadme server 45  the pharmacokinetics drug-likeness property and medicinal chemistry were assessed 46  default parameters were used to evaluate various physiochemical parameters molar refractivity molecular weight tpsa lipophilicity log pow wlogp log pow mlogp log pow xlogp3 log pow silicos-it log pow ilogp consensus log pow pharmacokinetics parameters log kp skin permeation and water solubility of the probable drug candidates 47  the inhibition effects of these natural therapeutics with different cytochromes p450s cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp1a2 cyp3a4 cyp2d6 were also studied in addition admetsar and osiris property explorer were employed to evaluate the toxic or undesired effects ie mutagenicity tumerogenecity of the compounds 48 49 50  all of the retrieved natural therapeutics were employed for molecular docking against mpp rdrp and spike protein of sars-cov-2 supplementary table 2  the scoring function of autodock vina was utilized to predict the interaction between the ligands therapeutics and the proteins the top five inhibitors for each protein was identified based on their free binding energy results showed that rifampin had the highest negative binding energy -163 kcalmol among top mpp inhibitors table   1  azobechalcone -146 kcalmol isolophirachalcone -13 kcalmol amentoflavone -128 kcalmol and cepharanthine -127 kcalmol docked with the mpp of sars-cov-2 were also exhibited topmost place with a higher negative binding energy -127 kcalmol as well table 1  while interacting with rdrp of sars-cov-2 the most negative binding energy was scored by azobechalcone -159 kcal mol following by rifampin -156 kcalmol tetrandrine -139 kcalmol biflavone -137 kcalmol biflavone -137 kcalmol  table 2  moreover azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone fangchinoline and tetrandrine were found to be top most natural inhibitors for the spike protein of sars-cov-2 azobechalcone required lowest energy -144 kcalmol to interact with the spike protein while rifampin isolophirachalcone fangchinoline and tetrandrine scored -137 kcalmol  -128 kcalmol -126 kcalmol and -125 kcalmol respectively table 3  however azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were found to be most effective inhibitory natural compounds when the docking results were compared for all three sars-cov-2 proteins figure 2 and table 4  all of these plant based natural inhibitors required minimum energy not more than -123 kcalmol to interact with the studied protein molecules the docking pattern and interacting amino acid residues with their respective position were analyzed to unravel the binding sites of studied sars-cov-2 proteins rifampin were involved with the amino acid h41 n142 s144 c145 h163 m165 e166 d187 r188 q189 of mpp of sars-cov-2  figure 2  the position of h41 c145 and m165 were also crucial for the binding of amentoflavone however an additional residue t430 were involved in case of isolophirachalcone table 3  p426 d428 t430 p463 f464 and f515 were also critical for binding pattern of rifampin and sars-cov-2 spike protein the most potent mpp rdrp and spike protein inhibitors azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were investigated in the spheres of physicochemical parameters lipophilicity pharmacokinetics and water solubility table 5  lipophilicity partition coefficient between n-octanol and water log pow were also calculated by using five widely available predictive models xlogp3 wlogp mlogp silicos-it ilogp gi absorption was lower for all the drug candidates azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline molecules had no repressive action with the p450 cyp isoforms cyp1a2 cyp2c19 cyp2c9 cyp2d6 cyp3a4 moreover no permeant bbb exists among the protein inhibitors of mpp rdrp and spike the compounds sowed water solubility from moderate to high level ie 130e-16 mgml 150e-02 mgml 118e-10 mgml 978e 09 mgml 461e-08 mgml respectively  table 5  the toxicity analysis of these inhibitors showed that there were no carcinogenic effect and organ toxicity however rifampin tetrandrine and fangchinoline were slightly positive in terms of mutagenesis though azobechalcone and isolophirachalcone inhibitors were completely negative among the top five inhibitors azobechalcone was listed in the acute oral toxicity category 2 and rest of them were listed in the category 3 global pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 has become a major concern due to its excessive infection rate and lethality 51 52 53 54  despite huge research regarding the pathogen no drugs or vaccine has proven satisfactory to combat infections caused by sars-cov-2 55 56  several investigational drugs exist however none of these could treat the patients unquestionably moreover lack of rapid detection procedures made sars-cov-2 diagnosis troublesome 57  computational approach and drug repurposing strategies hold promise to face such challenges caused by sars-cov-2 hence in the present study attempts were taken to suggest probable drug candidates by checking the efficacy of natural inhibitors to inhibit the key proteins of sars-cov-2 the race against the covid-19 pandemic has allowed the drug repurposing through virtual for finding drugs that could be used for the treatment of covid-19 recent studies prioritized mpp inhibitors of sars-cov-2 ie alpha-ketoamide hydroxy remdesivir chloroquine and favipiravir to evaluate their potency as drug 58 59 60  several in silico approach was also adopted to screen putative drug candidates against sars-cov-2 61 62  however all these experiments used either main protease proteins or rna-dependent rna polymerase of sars-cov-2 as probable drug targets in this study we screened potential natural therapeutics against sars-cov-2 mpp rdrp and spike protein by molecular docking approach here rifampin azobechalcone and azobechalcone were determined as top most drug candidates as they interacted with sars-cov-2 mpp rdrp and spike protein with lowest negative binding energy had the highest negative binding energy -163 kcalmol -159 kcal mol and -144 kcalmol respectively however comparative analysis revealed the superiority of 5 drug candidates ie azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine fangchinoline against sars-cov-2  table 4  the common drug surface hotspots were analyzed along with modeling of pharmacophore which is very important step for drug discovery three amino acid residues ie h41 c145 and m165 played the crucial role for the interaction of mpp with its inhibitors ie rifampin amentoflavone cepharanthine table 1  azobechalcone the top scorer among rdrp inhibitors again the position of f368 l371 l372 a375 w509 l514 y515 were vital for binding of rdrp with tetrandrine biflavone and fangchinoline table 2  most importantly the binding patterns of spike protein with isolophirachalcone fangchinoline and tetrandrine were significantly similar this study revealed the possibility of these amino acids to efficiently interact with drugs though requires validation in wet lab trials adme analysis of top drug candidates reveled no undesirable consequences by these compounds various physico-chemical parameters lipophilicity pharmacokinetics properties and water solubility were determined table 5  in addition no bbb permeant were identified among the top most inhibitors of mpp rdrp and spike protein the consequence of association of the natural inhibitory drugs of three key proteins with the cytochrome p450 cyp suggests that no substantial inhibition can occur however toxicity analysis revealed that rifampin tetrandrine and fangchinoline can be slightly mutagenic though there was no possibility for organ toxicity the results suggest that azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone and tetrandrine fangchinoline could be an option to treat sars-cov-2 infections however the study employed various computational approaches to screen the potent natural therapeutics and does not involve in-vivo assay currently investigational drugs of sars-cov-2 are under immense experimental evaluation therefore we suggest clinical trials for the experimental validation of our findings covid-19 pandemic situation is going to be a worst condition throughout the world rapid detection and social distancing are being encouraged at this stage but we need to search for immediate therapeutic options and effective vaccine candidates for battling this serious health crisis drug repurposing approaches could screened out the already approved drugs for reusing against any serious causative agents that are causing health complications plant metabolites based repurposed drug molecules could be a promising options against sars-cov-2 in the present study five plantr based therapeutics such as azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were suggested for potential inhibitors for the main protease protein rna dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 by using molecular docking based virtual screening study the study initiated the window towards the thinking of plant based therapy against covid-19 though extensive research and wet lab validation needs to make it usable for patient   delivering benefits at speed through real-world repurposing of off-patent drugs the covid-19 pandemic as a case in point gunther eysenbach david cavalla harry demonaco moshe rogosnitzky esther berkowitz alejandro jadad r   december 2019 heralded the transformation of modern-day life a new and lethal disease now named covid-19 was emerging in china and was about to change the world as we know it the same month in propitious timing a few hundred of the worlds leading physicians scientists government agency officials and nonprofit leaders gathered at an inaugural 2-day conference jointly sponsored by the us food and drug administration fda and national institutes of health nih in washington dc the topic of the conference was repurposing off-patent drugs and attendees had convened to discuss how widely used low-cost and safe medicines that are approved for one indication might be harnessed to provide additional novel and sometimes unexpected therapeutic benefits in other diseases dr christopher austin director of the national center for advancing translational sciences at the nih opened the conference by welcoming the birth of a new era in human medicine he asked participants to skewer some sacred cows emphasizing the need to embrace controversial thinking to improve patients lives if drug repurposing was an obscure subject for experts as well as the public covid-19 has changed that forever the publicity generated by the us president endorsing the antimalarial agents hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as treatments for covid-19 jolted regulatory authorities worldwide the fda felt compelled to grant emergency-use authorization for these drugs while the european medicines agency held back urging that they should not be prescribed outside of clinical trials and nationally agreed upon protocols in the absence of proven treatments many physicians at the frontlines of the covid-19 battle prescribed these drugs resulting in a worldwide shortage conflicting clinical trial data have emerged since then regarding use of these antimalarial drugs in covid-19 1-7 some of which indicate a lack of benefit or even the potential for harm 6 this underscores the need for emergency regulatory authorization of unproven treatments if deemed necessary in a public health crisis to be based first and foremost on robust evidence of safety it is also important that the relevant agency issues a statement emphasizing the exploratory nature of the intervention and urgent need for robust clinical trial data to support ongoing use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were developed as antimalarial treatments and subsequently repurposed for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis their repurposing for these challenging autoimmune diseases was facilitated by funding from pharmaceutical companies which recouped their investment through patent-protected revenues until the drugs became available as generics however only a small proportion of drug-repurposing discoveries enjoy patent protection and can benefit from the large and costly clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval by contrast real-world repurposingthe immediate off-label prescribing of drugs by caring physicians based on their acumen awareness of pilot studies or case reports or field experience in the clinical settingis a widely overlooked opportunity prescribing a drug off-label ie for a use other than what it was approved for is legal in almost every country worldwide however if there is an unforeseen adverse outcome the burden of liability shifts from the regulator or pharmaceutical company to the prescribing physician additionally the burden of payment shifts from the insurer or other institutional health care payers to the patient nevertheless when dealing with immediate and urgent health crises whether at an individual or public level real-world repurposing is frequently the only realistic solution to protect the public from unscrupulous players the us fda prohibits pharmaceutical companies from promoting off-label uses of their drugs which could be used to increase profit while avoiding investment in clinical trials by contrast the fda is supportive of disseminating information about promising off-label uses by independent entities a point reiterated in march 2020 on the fdas website 8 this underscores the importance of vigorous efforts to create reliable independent evidentiary repositories to disseminate such treatment opportunities and thereby support the decision making of those in the frontlines in nearly real time two additional critical elements are prerequisites if real-world repurposing is to deliver health benefits at the public level safety and affordability the former calls for a decades-long track record of established safety and the latter requires the availability of generic low-cost drug candidates fortunately many thousands of such drugs are already available the challenge is that no central repository of off-label uses exists in a way that enables immediate intervention in times of public health crises taking the covid-19 pandemic as an example we have selected four well-established drugs backed by many decades of safety data widespread use and affordability which we believe offer the opportunity to prevent or treat both the viral infection and the disabling and deadly complications that ensue although covid-19 usually presents with respiratory symptoms infection that spreads beyond the lung contributes significantly to the disease toll through uncontrolled outpouring of immune cells disturbed clotting multi-organ failure and other life-threatening complications there is extensive clinical support backed by a solid mechanistic scientific rationale underpinning the proposed drugs multimedia appendix 1 each was selected based on safety affordability and ability to target multiple aspects of the underlying disease processes that make covid-19 so deadly the proposed doses are those that have been shown to achieve the target physiological effects as demonstrated in the supporting references cimetidine and famotidine which are approved for heartburn caused by reflux disease 9 have been shown to have powerful effects on the immune system 10 data indicate that they can suppress a wide variety of common viruses including herpes and human papillomaviruses 11-13 and boost immune response after vaccination 14-20 with additional immune-modulating effects in a range of cancers and allergic diseases 10 they have also shown efficacy in protecting the heart from excessive workload lowering blood pressure and improving cardiac efficiency 2122 reducing inflammation 23 and inhibiting pathological blood clotting 2425 a clinical trial of famotidine in covid-19 was started recently in new york following the observation as yet unpublished that certain patients in china who were taking it when diagnosed with covid-19 had better clinical outcomes than those who were not 26 data generated from this new study are eagerly awaited the antiplatelet agent dipyridamole which is approved to prevent thrombotic events in at-risk patients 2728 has also caught the eye of researchers investigating potential treatments for covid-19 a recently published study in china illustrated its ability to suppress the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus that causes covid-19 leading to marked clinical improvements 29 a larger study recently launched in china examines dipyridamole in 460 patients with covid-19 chictr2000030055 beyond these antiviral effects dipyridamole has shown anti-inflammatory antioxidant and vasodilatory activity 30-34 and is one component of a widely used anticoagulant citrate-theophylline-adenosine-dipyridamole ctad 35-37 clinically cardioprotective effects have been reported in patients with chronic heart failure 38 and improved renal function is documented in patients with chronic kidney disease delaying risk of progression to dialysis and reducing mortality 3940 the cholesterol-lowering agents fenofibrate and bezafibrate are approved for treatment of dyslipidemias 41 although bezafibrate is unavailable in the united states it is widely used in europe meta-analyses show that they can reduce disability and death from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and stroke independent from their effects on cholesterol 4243 potentially protective effects on kidney function have been reported 4445 along with antiviral efficacy in patients with a hepatitis c virus infection 46 in some patients fibrates have lowered plasma fibrinogen levels to a statistically significant degree 47-52 suggesting the potential to address the dangerous hypercoagulability seen in many patients with covid-19 indeed fibrates have demonstrated anticoagulant and cardiovascular protective effects in patients with metabolic syndrome 53 which represents a hypercoagulable state accompanied by inflammation and endothelial dysfunction the phosphodiesterase-5 pde-5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate is a vasodilator that was approved in 1998 for treating erectile dysfunction 54 and more recently received an indication for pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 55 sildenafil has a wide range of anti-inflammatory antioxidant and vasodilatory actions across many body systems with benefits reported in case studies of patients with type 2 diabetes 5657 and hematological cancers 58 reported cardioprotective effects stemming from improved pulmonary circulation as well as direct action on the myocardium 59 include improved cardiac contractility and reduced symptoms in patients with a range of cardiac disorders 60-62 with reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at high risk 63 studies demonstrating sildenafils efficacy and tolerability in pah continue to accrue and a recent cochrane review and meta-analysis concluded that patients with pah who received pde-5 inhibitors were significantly less likely to die in the short-term than those receiving a placebo 64 sildenafil may also reduce mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 65 an interstitial lung disease with high mortality and preliminary evidence suggests that this drug class is actively renoprotective 6266 sildenafil is currently under investigation in a phase 3 trial in patients with covid-19 nct04304313 which will help clarify its therapeutic potential times of emergency such as with the covid-19 pandemic call for a radical review of the way we practice medicine as dr austin aptly stated we have to be ready to skewer some sacred cows clinical trials of unprofitable generic drugs sponsored by governments or nonprofit organizations are obviously welcome and important but should not delay the judicious use of well-established safe cost-effective and rationally prescribed therapies the race to find a cure for covid-19 has resulted in unprecedented worldwide research efforts as of the time of writing the milken foundation has compiled a list of treatments being studied for covid-19 67 nevertheless the time to approval and the expected high cost of the majority of these drugs may leave them out of reach for a large portion of the worlds population the four well-established drugs presented here for consideration alone or in combination for at-risk patients with covid-19 highlight the gems buried in the mountain of hundreds of thousands of clinical studies inaccessible to physicians battling at the frontlines of clinical medicine unbeknownst to most of them the four drugs selected in this case officially approved for a handful of indications have shown efficacy in managing over 100 additional diseases we do not propose specifically when or how each of these drugs should be used rather we aim to provide a pathophysiological rationale for their use alone or in combination share our understanding of why and how they may provide benefit and spur creative thinking about their potential use in this disease while illustrating the untapped potential of therapeutic options that may be hidden in plain sight the covid-19 pandemic represents an unparalleled opportunity to refocus our efforts on mining synthesizing and cataloging the body of evidence behind many promising treatment opportunities this article is an invitation to kindred spirits and curious bold humanitarians to pool efforts to harness this opportunity to future-proof our health care systems based on robust science we owe it to ourselves and future generations  drug repurposing against covid-19 focus on anticancer agents gennaro ciliberto rita mancini marco paggi g   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a mild-to-severe respiratory illness associated with symptoms fever cough and shortness of breath is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the very limited time allowed to face the covid-19 pandemic as well as its severity imposes an unwavering commitment  from the scientific community  to find proper therapeutic approaches as for several infectious diseases vaccination will likely able to generate a safe long-lasting protection from sars-cov-2 infection but this approach is not suitable for the current covid-19 outbreak as an alternative antiviral drugs or modulators of the host immune response can be considered however synthesis and full investigation - from preclinical studies to phase iii trials - of new medications is a time-consuming procedure and is not viable in a global emergency such as this conversely drug repurposingrepositioning a strategy effectively employed in cancer treatment 13 can represent a valid alternative provided that suitable medications are selected among the enormous number of potential already synthesized and often already clinically employed compounds drug repurposing has already been suggested for specific drugs in the treatment of the current covid-19 outbreak 49 most drugs considered for repurposingrepositioning in the therapy of the covid-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known due to years or even decades of clinical use this can allow their utilization in faster and less expensive phase iiiii clinical trials or even within straightforward compassionate use in particular a remarkable number of drugs re-considered for covid-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy this should not be surprising if we consider that virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids protein and lipid and boost their energy metabolism in order to comply to the viral program indeed the same features are seen in cancer cells making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication to our knowledge cancer drugs potentially suitable for facing sars-cov-2 infection have not been exhaustively reviewed in order to make a rational and effective choice of drugs amenable of repurposing for the therapy of covid-19 we can elaborate existing data from experimental and translational research clinical trials anecdotal reports and other published information we present here a comprehensive analysis of available information on potential candidate cancer drugs that can be repurposed for the treatment of coivd-19 rapamycin sirolimus has a long history of repositioning it was first used as an antifungal followed by an immunosuppressive agent in organ-transplanted patients and more recently also as an anticancer agent 2 10 its cellular target has been named mtor mammalian target of rapamycin after the name of the compound itself showing specific activity toward the mtorc1 complex 11 rapamycin is also effective in the therapy of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome 12 rapamycin decreases mtor phosphorylation mtorc1 13 causing a downstream perturbation of this signal transduction pathway the consequent catabolic inhibition and atp shortage evokes the activation of ampk 14 and of its substrate acaca promoting autophagy a physiological procedure through which cells recycle old organelles or damaged proteins in order to provide an alternative energy supply 15 16 mtor inhibition counteracts viral replication and improves outcomes in patients infected by andes virus 17 hcv 18 middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 19 and h1n1 pneumonia 20 in addition rapamycin alone or in combination with actinomycin d has been recently proposed to interfere with the sars-cov-2 interactome in a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform 5 as specified above rapamycin also presents immunosuppressant activity which could be relevant in mitigating the sars-cov-2-induced inflammatory response there are some rapamycin derivatives available eg temsirolimus everolimus and ridaforolimus which display slightly different pharmacokinetic characteristics and may be worth evaluation in the treatment for covid-19 among these ridaforolimus has been tested in phase ii clinical trial compared with progestin or investigator choice chemotherapy in advanced endometrial carcinoma showing encouraging results but elevated toxicity confirming the significance of the mtor pathway in these neoplasms 21 chloroquine cq is a drug characterized by several decades of clinical use due to its well-renowned preventive and curative antimalarial activity more recently cq has attracted the oncologists for its ability of interfering with the late stages of autophagy by producing cytoplasmic accumulation of non-functional autophagic vesicles 22 both normal and cancer cells utilize autophagy for energetic purposes but cancer cells due to their higher energy requirements rely more actively on autophagy especially after being stressed by radio- or chemotherapy 2325 therefore the association of first-line therapeutic approaches in cancer patients with autophagy inhibitors has been largely investigated 26 27 and suggested 2628 and clinically investigated in clinical trials mainly in cns tumors 2931 cq also possesses broad anti-infective and anti-viral properties 32 especially against flaviviruses retroviruses and coronaviruses 33 indeed cq can interfere with sialic acid biosynthesis compromising the post-translational modifications of the transmembrane viral binding proteins 34 35 thus impairing viral penetration inside the cell indeed interaction between sars-cov-2 and the membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 maximally expressed in lung alveolar epithelial cells enterocytes of the small intestine leydig cells and sertoli cells strongly depends upon glycosylation 36 cq also induces alkalization of endosomes thus inhibiting endocytosis of the viral particles and their enzymatic degradation by proteases 3739 an essential step for the release of functional viral nucleic acid 33 furthermore cq improves viral antigen presentation and thus enhances t-cell-mediated immunity 40 another major advantage of cq is its ability to modulate the inflammatory response and reduce the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines this molecule has been used since decades in the treatment of abnormal inflammatory responses sarcoidosis and autoimmune disorders rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus the ability of cq to reduce cytokine immune response 41 could be functional in governing the cytokine storm associated with covid-19 42 a mechanism similar to the one described for the inhibition of the autophagosomes could be speculated to impair formation and release of virion-containing vesicles by infected cells very recently cq has been used in covid-19 therapy at the dose of 500 mgday with favorable results 39 butother studies demonstrate high toxicity and scarce effect of either cq 43 or its analogue hydroxychloroquine hcq 44 45 in treating patients with severe covid-19 since autophagy is regulated by the interplay between mtor 46 and ampk 15 the use of cq in combination with drugs able to interfere with these pathways should be carefully evaluated cq has a well-known safety profile but it is associated with toxic retinopathy renal and cardiac toxicity which occur when the safe dose is exceeded hcq possesses slightly different pharmacokinetic properties and displays less overall toxicity hcq is commercially available worldwide which it is not the case for cq whose distribution has been discontinued in some countries 47 both cq and hcq are being considered for use to preventing covid-19 in sars-cov-2 post-exposure and long-term prophylaxis 48 si113 is a small molecule able to inhibit the activity of sgk1 an akt-related kinase involved in the pi3kmtor pathway and in emt 49 this kinase plays a pivotal role in cancer proliferation and drug resistance 49 50 and is sensitive to the small molecule si113 51 which is thus able to inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo 52 53 via a multifaceted mechanism of action including inhibition of the pi3kmtor pathway and stimulation of autophagy 54 infection by mers-cov a cognate of sars-cov-2 induces a massive inflammatory response possibly related with fibrosis mainly via the upregulation of the t helper th 1 and th17 cells 55 of note il-17-producing th cells are induced by the activity of sgk1 56 additionally experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease showed the role of th17 and sgk1 as mediators of the th17 switch 57 therefore si113 could deserve evaluation in the prevention of the cytokine storm-induced lung fibrosis it should be noted that si113 has never been used in humans but it is effective in reducing tumor growth in cancer-bearing mice appearing also well tolerated and non-toxic 52 53 thus si113 cannot be considered a repurposed drug although preclinical models indicate it as potentially effective in covid-19 therapy we included this drug in the present manuscript for the sake of completeness this compound is a humanized monoclonal antibody moab targeting interleukin-6 receptor il-6r pharmacology pharmacokinetics clinical efficacy safety and role of tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis ra are well-established 58 and possibly due also to its effect on the aktmtor pathway 59 tocilizumab has also been approved for the treatment of the cytokine storm associated with cancer immunotherapy 60 or more often with car-t therapy 61 62 this moab does not have direct antiviral effects but effectively contrasts the massive cytokine release syndrome displayed in severe covid-19 by antagonizing the binding of il-6 one of the cytokines most involved in this process to its receptor 58 after the first report of the effectiveness of tocilizumab in restraining the cytokine storm deriving from sars-cov-2 infection 63 this drug is currently under evaluation in a multicenter phase ii clinical investigation in italy on its efficacy and safety in patients with covid-19 pneumonia 64 the fda has approved a phase iii randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to assess the effectiveness of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia 65 in addition an increasing number of clinical trials involving the use of this drug in the treatment of covid-19 are ongoing httpsclinicaltrialsgov sarilumab is an anti-il-6r moab approved for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis 66 with a well-defined role also in blocking il-6 action in cancer 67while emapalumab directed toward interferon ifn- is used in the therapy of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 68 69 and is employed in combination with anakinra an il-1r antagonist in ra patients 70 as tocilizumab also sarilumab and emapalumab can effectively counteract the massive cytokine release related with sars-cov-2 infection agenzia italiana del farmaco aifa approved the use of either sarilumab or emapalumab in phase iiiii clinical studies involving hospitalized patients with covid-19 pulmonary complications with the aim to counteract the cytokine storm 64 monalizumab is a moab directed toward nkg2a cd94 a receptor for the recognition of mhc class i hla-e molecules nkg2a is gaining relevance as a key player in cancer-mediated immune checkpoint blockade and its neutralization by monalizumab restores the host immune response toward cancer 71 monalizumab is under clinical investigation in advanced gynecologic malignancies 72 interestingly nkg2a appears overexpressed in cytotoxic t lymphocytes and natural killer cells in sars-cov-2-infected patients 73 74 where it may reestablish the host immune response and increase survival in patients with severe pneumonia bacillus calmette-gurin bcg an invaluable tool for vaccination against tuberculosis has been widely used as a concomitant therapeutic approach for lung cancer 75 and is considered as an overall protection from lung cancer incidence 76 more recently bcg has been successfully used for the local treatment of intermediatehigh-risk bladder cancer 77 bcg presents recognized immunomodulatory properties 78 and is associated with reduced risk of asthma 79 immunization via bcg provides relief from airway inflammation through the inhibition of a tgf-1-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition emt inhibiting the related remodeling of the respiratory tract accompanied with loss of lung epithelial integrity and fibrotic evolution 80 in the covid-19 setting epithelial integrity of the respiratory tract is fundamental since permanent lung fibrosis is a serious risk for severe and critically severe covid-19 survivors 42 therefore bcg might reduce the risk of severe disease progression and potentially reduce the mortality and disability rate the association of the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir is an approved treatment for hiv treatment it is effective in restraining the growth of urological malignancies in vitro where induces endoplasmic reticulum stress mtor inactivation and ampk boosting 83 the same drug combination has been also evaluated in the treatment of cervical cancer patients 84 the association between lopinavir and ritonavir is effective in reducing the risk of adverse clinical outcomes and viral load in sars patients 85 on these bases this cocktail has been proposed for the treatment of covid-19 but a very recent clinical trial showed no benefits in adult patients with severe disease 86 this drug is a guanosine analogue and rna synthesis inhibitor successfully employed in the therapy chronic hepatitis c virus hcv infection 87 as far as cancer is concerned this compound induces gtp depletion in hela cervical cancer cells 88 and is effective in inhibiting glioblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo in preclinical models 81 along this line the efficacy of ribavirin in the oncological setting is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer 89 ribavirin is also endowed with covid-19 anti-rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp activity 4 clinical trials are ongoing based upon available data regarding dosage and toxicity derived from broad experience on the use of this drug as an anti- hcv compound this compound is not cancer-related but deserves to be mentioned as a paradigmatic case of effective repositioning it is a prodrug of an adenine analogue thus a viral rna polymerase inhibitor used during the ebola outbreak 90 remdesivir has been found effective in vitro against sars-cov-2 infection when administered in concomitance with the antimalarial cq see above 91 and in vivo in a primate model rhesus macaque either as prophylaxis or therapy of mers-cov infection 92 presently clinical trials on remdesivir in covid-19 are enrolling patients and are supported by the national institutes of health nih 93 usa and aifa italy 64 compassionate use of remdesivir in covid-19 patients in a single-arm clinical trial gave positive preliminary outcomes 94 which appear in contrast with the results published by another group 95 while the debate over the efficacy of this drug is still open according to the preliminary results reported in the actt nih clinical trial 93 the fda has given remdesivir an emergency use authorization restricted to patients affected by severe covid-19 96 covid-19 a lesson to be learned the sars-cov-2 pandemic has been generated by a new strain of the coronavirus that has never previously been identified in humans this virus is phylogenetically close to sars-cov the causative agent of sars sars-cov-2 which reached humans via a spillover process from other animal species possesses a peculiar tropism for the airway epithelium in humans showing also elevated contagiousness and an extremely variable clinical course of its infection the covid-19 outbreak found the world definitely unprepared to handle such a global emergency similar concerns must be raised toward a potential novel strain possibly responsible for future viral outbreaks in order not to replicate the extremely negative outcome of the influenza a h1n1 19181919 spanish pandemic 97 to this end it is mandatory to work prospectively to produce or identify better antiviral drugs and prophylactictherapeutic moab therapies as well as possibly targeting vital pathogenic factors such as in the case of sars-cov-2 spike protein rbd 36 98 or the main protease mpro 99 in addition a study on the immune response of patients that have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection could be of great interest in line with what was carried out for the ebola survivors 100 the forcedly limited number of drugs briefly described in this review appear to act essentially through selected mechanisms ie a inhibition of the pi3kaktsgk1mtor signaling cascade b inhibition of the cytokine storm and c inhibition of viral nucleic acid synthesis the activation of the pi3kaktsgk1mtor pathway appears fundamental for supporting the replication of various virus species in the host 1720 by boosting their energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production especially in the cells of the immune system 101 102 therefore drugs able to interfere with mtorc1 signaling can produce atp shortage in the cells in which the virus is replicating characterized by an excess of energy requirements such a metabolic pattern is reminiscent of the peculiar setup of the energy metabolism in cancer cells ie warburg effect 103 104 where a pivotal role is played by the pi3kaktsgk1mtor signaling cascade 10 105 106 given the above it is not surprising that all the non-specific antiviral drugs here described ie the anticancer drugs repositionable in covid-19 therapy deal with energy metabolism and inflammation a set of the drugs described here eg those with explicit antiviral effect can be preferred for the early stages of sars-cov-2 infection while those dedicated to restraining the cytokine response  and without explicit antiviral effect - should be employed if necessary at later time points anyway we should always consider that even if the medications discussed in this review are safely in use in the clinics the final decision for their administration in covid-19 for compassionate and urgent use when in the absence of validated clinical trials should be taken solely after collegial approval by the clinical team taking care of the patient and under strict clinical surveillance indeed unpredictable toxic side effects can arise possibly linked with the patient clinical status or to the simultaneous administration of other drugs finally an interesting evaluation on how covid-19 pandemic will affect the clinical care in the seven comprehensive cancer centers of cancer core europe is discussed in a timely paper 107 the authors illustrate appropriate guidelines that can transform this pandemic into an opportunity eg for the assessment of the clinical effects of de-escalating anticancer regimens forcedly imposed in order to prevent or reduce iatrogenic neutropenia and lymphopenia we hope that these findings may pave the way for a more comprehensive clinical experimentation on repurposing of old drugs to the treatment of covid-19 a line of research sustained by scant funds but of prime importance to face this new worldwide challenge  repurposing low-molecular-weight drugs against the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 jia gao liang zhang xiaodan liu fudong li rongsheng ma zhongliang zhu jiahai zhang jihui wu yunyu shi yueyin pan yushu ge ke ruan  the coronavirus disease pandemic caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has affected the global healthcare system drug repurposing is a feasible method for emergency treatment as low-molecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential sars-cov-2 targets we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach herein using ligand-and protein-observed fragment screening approaches we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the sars-cov-2 m pro  thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of m pro  chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites ie the catalytic pocket of m pro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes therefore we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur bendamustine triclabendazole and emedastine these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low-molecular-weight drugs against the sars-cov-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs  the coronavirus disease pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1-3 has so far affected 4 million people worldwide with a mortality rate of approximately 7 main protease m pro or 3cl pro  is one of the most extensively studied targets of coronaviruses 4  m pro plays an essential role in the cleavage of viral rna-translated virus polypeptide 5 and recognizes at least 11 cleavage sites in replicase polyprotein 1ab eg lqsag denotes the cleavage site covalent inhibitors against the sars-cov-2 m pro have recently demonstrated potency toward inhibiting viral replication in cellular assays 6 7  this further underpins the druggability of m pro  however these compounds remain in the early stages of preclinical studies and the development of new drugs usually takes years the lack of drugs targeting the sars-cov-2currently poses a threat to numerous covid-19 patients the covid-19 pandemic has implored the repurposing of oral drugs 8  as most recently approved drugs have been designed and optimized for specific targets they are unlikely to completely match interactions with the sars-cov-2 targets compared with 13550 potential drugs in the drugbank database at various stages from preclinical studies through approval the estimated number of drug-like compounds molecular weight of 500 da is reportedly approximately 10 60  therefore the possibility of uncovering a highly potent and specific drug against the sars-cov-2 is quite slim conversely low-molecular-weight drugs with intermediate potency and high safety can be an alternative treatment against the sars-cov-2 the toxicity of many low-molecular-weight drugs has been well understood owing to long clinical trials furthermore their low structural complexity adds odds to fully match the interactions with anti-sars-cov-2 targets eg the chemical space of compounds with 11 non-hydrogen atoms is approximately 10 9  this is the cornerstoneof fragment-based lead discovery 9  and many of the compounds in the fragment library were indeed extracted from pharmacophores of the approved drugs we therefore hypothesize that it is highly possible to identify a low-molecular-weight drug containing pharmacophores using fragment-based screening fbs we therefore assessed 38 compounds which are pharmacophores substructures of repurposing drugs proposed from virtual screening from our fragment library 10-15 against the sars-cov-2 target as these candidates have been predicted to bind at a high affinity their pharmacophores should bind as well albeit at a weaker affinity these weak binders can be readily identified using a nuclear magnetic resonance nmr fragment-based approach thereby eliminating the distracting false positives in virtual screening using our nmr fragment-based approach 16 19  as these two proteins share 96 sequence identity key residues proximal to the catalytic site including h41 v42 d48 n51g143 h163 and v186 were thus assigned  figure s1  both niacin and hit 1 perturb a common residue v42 suggesting that these two hits bind to the catalytic core of sars-cov-2 m pro  interestingly these two hits also recognize different sets of residues in the catalytic core for example niacin perturbs h41 g143 n51 and v186 figure 2a  whereas hit 1 induces csps of residues m165 e166 and l167 figure 2b  mapping of these residues to the surface representation of the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 m pro pdb code 6lu7 6 suggested that these two hits adopted different orientations in the catalytic site with a shared anchor point near v42 figure 2c  considering the molecular size of niacin and the spatial distribution of the perturbed residues niacin probably binds more than one site nevertheless the csp pattern suggests that the catalytic core of the sars-cov-2 m pro accommodates compounds larger than niacin and hit 1 we therefore searched for low-molecular-weight 400 da drugs containing the pharmacophores of niacin and hit 1 molecular docking identified carmofur as a niacin derivative titration of carmofur with 15 n-labeled sars-cov-2 m pro -n induced an extra setof cross peaks at a ligandprotein molar ratio of 21 and some original signals completely disappeared at a molar ratio of 41  figure s2a  this indicated a strong binding between carmofur and sars-cov-2 m pro  as confirmed by the ic 50 of 28  02 m determined using enzymatic assay at an m pro concentration of 05 m  figure s2b  however the original nmr signals completely disappeared at a ligandprotein molar ratio that significantly deviated from a stoichiometry of 11 it has been recently demonstrated that carmofur is a covalent inhibitor of the main protease of thesars-cov-2 with an ic 50 value of 182 m in the presence of 02 m enzyme 6  this was consistent with our measurement as a higher m pro concentration was used in our case collectively these data suggest that covalent linking to the sars-cov-2 m pro is driven by excess carmofur nevertheless using this fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for repurposing low-molecular-weight drugs targeting sars-cov-2 m pro  further pharmacophore identification and molecular docking nominated several low-molecular-weight analogs of hit 1 for example triclabendazole emedastine and bendamustine  figure s3a  the single-dose enzymatic assay showed that these three drugs had significantly higher potency than hit 1  figure s3b  we further determined the dose-dependent response of bendamustine and emedastine in the inhibition of the sars-cov-2 m pro activity with ic 50 values of 26  1 m and 82  7 m figure 3a  the ic 50 value of triclabendazole was roughly estimated to be 70 m from the two-dose inhibition rates 31 and 72 inhibition at 50 m and 100 m triclabendazole respectively as limited by the low aqueous solubility of triclabendazole further bendamustine and emedastine induced significantly larger csps in a dose-dependent manner than hit 1 figure 3b  taken together our fragment-based strategy facilitates the identification of low-molecular-weight drugs against the sars-cov-2 m pro  first this approachcan be readily applied to identify low-molecular-weight drugs against other sars-cov-2 targets eg rna-dependent rna polymerase or the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein second a combination of these low-molecular-weight drugs may be used to gain higher potency than that achieved via a single compound if their binding topologies show no evidence of steric repulsion finally although carmofur and bendamustine show higher potency than the fragment screening hits the toxicity of anti-cancer drugs remains a challenge in their clinical applications conversely triclabendazole and emedastine could be valuable in inhibiting the sars-cov-2 replication at the early stage it may also serve as a starting point for the next round of pharmacophore identification in general our study provides new insights toward the repurposing of low-molecular-weight drugs against the sars-cov-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs   the covid-19 gene and drug set library maxim kuleshov v daniel clarke jb eryk kropiwnicki kathleen jagodnik m alon bartal john

province china in november 2019 infection with sars-cov-2 causes the coronavirus disease covid-19 globally there are more than 29 million confirmed covid-19 cases and 203000 reported deaths as of april 25 2020 the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on march 11 2020 many biomedical researchers have been shifting their efforts to battle the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic one area of activity is computationally prioritizing and experimentally testing approved drugs for repurposing as candidate therapies for attenuating covid-19 infection drug repurposing studies present a promising avenue for quickly offering a treatment for covid-19 because these drugs have known safety profiles so far drug repurposing studies can be categorized into three groups in-vitro screens 16 computational predictions based on structural biology methods 79 and computational predictions based on network models and transcriptomics 1012 few studies have validated top computational predictions in cell-based models for covid-19 cell based models 71011 the lists of drugs mentioned in these studies can be analyzed for consensus and suggested drugs can be grouped by their type at the same time many researchers attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms of the covid-19 virus life cycle much attention has been given to a study that profiled with mass-spectrometry proteomics host proteins that interact with each of the covid-19 proteins 11 another important dataset produced rna-seq gene expression signatures from various relevant human cell lines ferret model lungs and human lung biopsies before and after covid-19 infection 13 these are just two examples of the many studies that produce gene sets that can be organized and compared in the past we developed a crowdsourcing project where we asked the community to identify gene expression signatures from drug gene and disease perturbations 14 the collection of over 6000 signatures that we collected with the help of 70 contributors from around the world enabled us to produce a useful database called creeds similarly for this project we developed a crowdsourcing project to integrate gene and drug sets related to covid-19 research collected with the assistance of the research community since the emergence of the covid-19 epidemic tens of thousands of new publications related to covid-19 research have emerged in a very short period 2 months we continually survey these publications to identify research that describes drug repurposing efforts and manually extract drug sets from these studies to populate the drug set library we also submit to the platform published drug sets from historical sources such as those from studies that listed drugs showing antiviral activity for other related viruses so far we have collected 20 drug repurposing publications table 1 an updated version of this table is maintained here httpsdocsqooqleeomspreadsheetsd16akazgadflqnrqofqwllrhcxfugyirbzwyipionwmedituspsharing to assist us with developing and maintaining the collection we have received help from the research community by allowing researchers to upload gene and drug sets to the database these submissions are manually evaluated before making them publicly available a set of 35 gene expression signatures resulting from infections by different coronaviruses for different cell types and tissues with expression data originating from the gene expression omnibus geo database was processed using the geo2enrichr tool 15 and stored on the gen3va platform 16 the 70 entries were submitted to the covid-19 crowdsourcing platform with an upregulated and a downregulated gene set associated with each signature the gen3va report for these signatures is available here httpsamppharmmssmedugen3vareport646sars geneshot 17 is a platform that we developed to convert pubmed searches into gene sets using geneshot gene sets associated with the search terms sars sars-cov mers-cov ace2 and tmprss2 were created using both the autorif and generif 18 methods additionally top covid-19 drug repurposing candidates reported in recent literature table 1 including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were included predictions of additional genes potentially associated with these terms were also added to the covid-19 gene set library these predictions were based on the literature-associated genes using each of five strategies co-occurrence via autorif generif enrichr 19 tagger 20 and co-expression using data from archs4 21 twitter is an important source for timely discussions related to therapeutics for covid-19 including drug repurposing efforts and clinical trials using the twitter api we query twitter daily with a list of more than 14000 drug terms and their synonyms to collect tweets that mentioned these drugs in context of covid-19 the drug search list was curated from drugbank 22 l1000fwd 23 and the list of drugs submitted to the covid19 drug and gene set library website we then filter the identified tweets for those that are co-mentioned with covid-19 and sars linguistic variations for each drug we counted the occurrences of tweets and recorded a tally of mentions for each day data collection continues with daily reports tweet ids of the tweets originating the discussions and the longitudinal drug trends these data are shared publicly on githubhttpsgithubcommaayanlabcovid19drugstrendtrackertreemasterdailyreports each day the set of discussed drugs on twitter are automatically deposited into the covid-19 drug set library via an api this approach enables real time trend detection of the the most discussed drugs as potential therapeutics for covid-19 while enriching the content of the covid-19 drug and gene set library the covid-19 gene and drug set library website has five sortable and searchable tables that list the drug and gene sets fig 1 sorting can be based on the date of submission alphabetical ordering or list size the two tables are searchable via metadata terms such as title authors and descriptions as well as via data search for specific gene or drug names users can download each gene set or drug set as well as the entire library in addition each gene set is provided with the option to perform gene set enrichment analysis with enrichr 19 while genes are linked to harmonizome 24 for further interrogation the individual drugs that map to known compounds are linkable to their corresponding drugbank landing pages 22 the website enables users to submit drug and gene sets related to covid-19 research by completing a simple form the form includes a dataset title a url source and a description that explains how the set is relevant to covid-19 research the submitter is also provided with mechanisms to add additional metadata terms that can describe the cell type tissue organism and other critical information about the submitted set users can specify the category of metadata provided allowing for a broad set of additional metadata about each set users can also opt to submit their contact information this information is kept private but users can opt-in to make it public once a user submits a contribution to the site their dataset is directed to a review queue in which we can examine the validity and relevance of the contribution the reviewing process enables an administrator to approve or reject the submitted set if approved the set is added to the library to make it easy for contributors to submit multiple sets users can access the site via api the code behind the site is open source and available at httpsgithubcommaayanlabcovid19crowdlibrary drug sets extracted from 3 in-vitro screens 13 were first identified the drugs were matched to drugs profiled by the l1000 assay available from gse92742 average signatures for each drug were computed by taking the z-score mean for each gene clusters were identified based on the average signatures using hierarchical clustering differential z-scores of genes relative to the two clusters were identified using the t-test statistic the top up and down differentially expressed genes in each cluster were submitted to enrichr for gene set enrichment analysis to quantify the z-scores of genes co-expressed with ace2 we calculated the correlation over 2000 randomly sampled drug signatures from the l1000 database we then calculated the mean z-scores of the top 50 correlated genes to ace2 and compared those values against a distribution calculated from sampling 50 random genes repeatedly 10000 times the p-values were calculated against the sampled distribution and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing by applying the bonferroni correction method the code behind this analysis is open source and available at httpsgithubcommaayanlabcovid19l1000 so far we have collected 87 drug sets composed of 1265 unique drugs and 361 gene sets consisting of 13347 unique genes the drug sets are subdivided into four categories experimental 20 computational 31 twitter 31 and other 5 the top 20 most frequent drugs and genes across all sets are displayed in fig 2ae the list of experimental drugs with most supportive evidence are hydroxychloroquine mefloquine chloroquine and remdesivir fig 2a while hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and remdesivir are the most discussed drugs on twitter mefloquine received so far less attention fig 3 while mefloquine is consistently ranked within the top 100 drugs each day the anti-malaria drug mefloquine 25 is much less discussed and as such may be a good candidate for further experimental investigation fig 3 the top 20 most frequently submitted genes are all members of the innate immune response fig 2e these genes include the typical interferon and cytokine response genes observed to be involved in the response of human cells to most pathogens these genes are also listed as the top differentially expressed upregulated genes from the gen3va report of 35 signatures fig 4 however the list here also includes the immediate early gene ieg module composed of the transcription factors egr1 and fos and the phosphatase dusp1 based on enrichment analysis with enrichr 19 the top 10 downregulated genes from the gen3va report include five genes sh3bgrl lgals1 cox7a2 crip1 and lyz that are highly expressed in dendritic cells p-value  0003 fisher exact test suggesting that there may be a depletion of dendritic cells due to sars infections our ability to collect tweets about drugs using the twitter api enables us to track trends about new drugs that are increasingly discussed on this social media platform during the period between april 2nd to april 24th 2020 we noticed the rise and fall of discussions about the drug galidesivir fig 5 galidesivir bcx4430 is an adenosine analog that was previously suggested as a potential antiviral drug for several related viral diseases 2628 while most of the drug sets in the library are from studies that utilized computational methods to predict drugs few are from large-scale approved drug screens 16 using the venn diagram tool developed for ad-hoc analysis of the sets in the library we compared the results from six in-vitro covid-19 drug screen studies fig 6 although there is very little overlap across these drug screens where only one or two drugs are shared across these experimental studies some interesting less discussed hits emerge namely these are amuvatinib proscillaridin mefloquine hexachlorophene clofazimine and almitrine amuvatinib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor 29 and proscillaridin is an organic compound that is used an old cardiotonic steroid but more recently suggested as a cancer agent 30 hexachlorophene is a disinfectant that is used in dermatological products 31 clofazimine is a drug used to treat leprosy and its mechanisms of action suggest that it interferes with dna synthesis 32 almitrine is a drug that stimulates respiratory respiration by activating receptors of carotid bodies 33 it is used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 34 and as such it is most relevant to the covid-19 symptoms to further explore the molecular effects of positive hits from the in-vitro drug screens and to demonstrate the utility of the collected library we developed a case study that asks whether drugs that have been shown to inhibit covid-19 infection of human cells in-vitro up- or down-regulate the ace2 gene ace2 is the suspected cell surface receptor for covid-19 35 and cells that do not express this gene have been shown to be less prone to covid-19 infection since it is still undetermined whether it is desired to up- or down-regulate ace2 expression we queried each drug hit from two published in-vitro drugs screens against the lincs l1000 data 36 we identified 23 drug hits from the screens that have been profiled by l1000 comprising a total of 1251 differential gene expression profiles 17 of these drugs display on average an increase in ace2 expression while 6 drugs display a decrease in expression of ace2 overall the gene expression signatures for these 23 drugs can be categorized into two distinct clusters fig 7 the observed difference in gene expression signatures suggest different modes of action for these drugs the drugs that are most similar to chloroquine exhibit consistent up-regulation of genes highly correlated to ace2 chloroquine gene expression signatures on average up-regulate the top 50 most correlated genes to ace2 p255e-03 in addition cepharanthine fluspirilene bazedoxifene and amuvatinib also up-regulate the same set of ace2 most correlated genes p317e-17 p701e-13 p274e-03 and p494e-03 respectively these 50 genes are available in table 2 the strong dysregulation of ace2 associated genes could point to a similar mode of action regarding antiviral activity enrichment analysis of the consensus genes upregulated by the drugs that co-cluster with chloroquine dislpay up regulation of immune response genes and down-regulation of cell cycle genes this suggests that the drugs in the chloroquine cluster are pro-inflammatory while the other cluster of drugs contains anti-inflammatory drugs up genes in the chloroquine cluster httpsamppharmmssmeduenrichrenrichdatasetd9201bbba4dff47598bcf66f3db3e93e down genes in the chloroquine cluster httpsamppharmmssmeduenrichrenrichdataset698f9a31fbc85e13da57bce68a543083 here we describe a platform created to collect drug and gene sets related to covid-19 research using various methods of data accrual all of the top 10 genes associated with covid-19 are interferon-related isg15 irf7 oas1 ifitm3 mx1 ifih1 stat1 ifit3 and eif2ak2 this is consistent with our knowledge that type i ifn- ifn- and type iii interferon ifn- systems are the primary defense against viral infections it has been hypothesized that hyper-inflammation in covid-19 could drive disease severity and would be amenable to treatment with drugs that reduce inflammation 37 however this remains controversial as the high level of antiviral response could be reflective of increased viral burden rather than an inappropriate host response 38 the most striking result from the meta-analysis applied to the content of the library is the little overlap across drug screen studies it is expected that experimental validation of drugs to inhibit covid-19 in-vitro will be more consistent the inconsistency across these studies could be due to a need to produce results quickly due to the urgency for discovering potential treatments regardless there is some overlap and there is expectation that more screens will be published and top leads will advance to animal models and human trials for further testing to prioritize compounds that may treat covid-19 some researchers have used the strategy of finding drugs that modulate genes related to ace2 gene expression 39 we found a highly significant up-regulation of the genes most correlated with ace2 by chloroquine and related compounds in the l1000 database this finding suggests that identifying compounds that up-regulate genes correlated with ace2 expression could be a useful approach for identifying more compounds that inhibit covid-19 in mammalian cells however it should be noted that other considerations must be taken into account including the known side effects for the compounds and whether dosing would allow for high enough drug concentration to achieve therapeutic effects it should be clear that the consensus analysis results should be viewed with caution the most common drugs are not necessarily the most efficacious or promising treatments at the same time the most common genes may not be the most relevant to understand covid-19 research it should be noted that not all drug sets and gene sets have equal weight in quality and relevancy a list of computationally predicted drugs is not as useful towards identifying a therapy for covid-19 when compared with a list of experimentally validated drugs a list of upregulated genes after covid-19 infection of cells may provide more useful information about the virus life cycle when compared with a list of genes returned from a geneshot search using the term sars hence the users of the data collected into the library should be aware of such limitations with these limitations in mind we hope that researchers will be able to develop or refine hypotheses from the snapshot overview our platform provides and then delve deeper into the studies most relevant to their questions for example the gen3va report revealed a down-regulation of genes known to be enriched in dendritic cells dcs after infection with sars sars-cov-1 is known to infect dcs and impair dc function 40 in a period of rapid development of methods and data related to covid-19 research it is critical to provide means to organize the accumulated information in a way that it can be summarized and reused the covid-19 gene set and drug set library provides such utility the library of drug and gene sets can be used to identify community consensus and make researchers and clinicians aware of the development of new potential therapies as they become available as well as allow the research community to work together towards a cure for covid-19 social media has played a critical role in enabling scientists to communicate results rapidly and exchange ideas by mining the trends about discussions on twitter about drugs in context of covid-19 we are able to keep track with global trends before these are reported in scientific journals  fast identification of possible drug treatment of coronavirus
disease-19 covid-19 through computational drug repurposing
study junmei wang   a great application of drug repurposing is to identify drugs that were
developed for treating other diseases to treat a new disease drug
repurposing can be achieved by conducting systematic drugdrug target
interaction dti and drugdrug interaction ddi analyses we have
conducted a survey on dtis collected by the drugbank database5 and found that on average each drug has 3 drug targets
and each drug target has 47 drugs6 the analysis
demonstrates that polypharmacology is a common phenomenon it is important
to identify potential dtis for both approved drugs and drug candidates
which serves as the basis of repurposing drugs and selection of drug targets
without dtis that may cause side effects polypharmacology opens novel
avenues to rationally design the next generation of more effective but less
toxic therapeutic agents computer-aided drug design cadd has been playing
essential roles in modern drug discovery and development to balance the
computational efficiency and accuracy a hierarchical strategy employing
different types of scoring functions are applied in both the drug lead
identification and optimization phases a docking scoring function such as
the one employed by the glide docking program7 is very
efficient and thus can be utilized to screen a large library but it is not
very accurate on the other hand the molecular mechanical force field
mmff-based scoring functions are physical and more accurate but much less
efficient with the ever increasing computer power mmff-based free energy
calculation methods such as the end point mm-pbsa molecular mechanics
poissonboltzmann surface area and mm-gbsa molecular mechanics
generalized born surface area methods23821
and the alchemical thermodynamic integration ti and free energy
perturbation fep methods2223 have been extensively applied in
structure-based drug discovery projects we have developed a hierarchical
virtual screening hvs to balance the efficiency and accuracy and improve
the success rate of rational drug design824 the newly released
crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease1 provides a
solid structural basis for identification of drugs that might interact with
this protein target in this work i applied multiscale modeling techniques
to identify drugs that may be repurposed to target sars-cov-2 main protease
flexible docking and mm-pbsa-weighted solvent-accessible surface area wsas
were applied as the first and second filters respectively to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of hvs in inhibitor identification for sars-cov-2
main protease compared to the experimental means cadd-based approaches are
more efficient in providing possible treatment solutions for epidemic
disease outbreaks like covid-19 the detailed ligandresidue
interaction profile as well as the decomposition of binding free energy
into different components provides insight into rationally designing potent
and selective inhibitors of sars-cov-2 main protease the crystal structure was first treated using the protein structure
preparation wizard provided by the schrodinger software followed by
docking grid generation glide flexible docking was performed using
the default settings except that the formation of intramolecular
hydrogen bonds was rewarded and the enhancement of planarity of
conjugated  groups was turned on the cocrystal ligand n3 was
covalently bonded to cys145 i generated a new version of n3
n3 by breaking the covalent bond and filling in open valence
i then evaluated whether glide flexible docking can reproduce the
native binding pose in addition a data set of approved drugs was
prepared using drugbank5 and a set of pubchem
compounds that are structurally similar to lopinavir were enriched for
docking screenings lopinavir a potent inhibitor of hiv-1
protease26 was found to be effective in
treating covid-19 patients top hits from the docking screenings were
advanced to the next hvs filter mm-pbsa-wsas the 3d-structures of
the screening compounds were generated using the openbabel
software27 md simulations were first performed for a docking hit for two purposes
1 studying the relative stability of the ligand residing in the
binding pocket 2 sampling a set of conformations for mm-pbsa-wsas
binding free energy calculations and mm-gbsa residueligand
binding free energy decomposition analysis a md system consisted of
one copy of sars-cov-2 main protease one copy of docked ligand 17597
tip3p28 water molecules and about 50
na and cl ions depending on the
charge state of the ligand the whole system was neutralized for the
force field parameters the partial atomic charges of ligands were
derived using the resp29 program to fit the
hf6-31g electrostatic potentials generated using the gaussian 16
software package30 the other force field
parameters of ligands come from gaff31 and the
amber ff14sb32 force field was employed to model
the viral protein the residue topologies for ligands were prepared
using the antechamber module33 implemented in the
amber software package34 for the covalently bonded
n3 ligand i applied the residuegen program to generate nonstandard
amino acid residue topology for a proteinligand complex the md system was first relaxed
through a series of minimization procedures the main chain atoms of
the receptor and the bound ligand were restrained using a harmonic
potential and its force constant decreased from 20 to 10 5 1 and 0
kcalmol2 progressively in five
10 000-step minimizations note that the last step applied no
restraint at all as the force constant is 0 the system was further
relaxed by a set of 100 ps atomistic md simulations with the same
restraint setting of minimizations there were three phases for a md simulation the relaxation phase the
equilibrium phase and the sampling phase in the relaxation phase
the simulation system was heated progressively from 50 to 250 k in
steps of 50 k at each temperature a 1 ns md simulation was performed
without any restraints or constraints in the next equilibrium phase
the system was equilibrated at 298 k 1 bar for 10 ns finally a 100
ns md simulation was performed at 298 k 1 bar to produce ntp
constant temperature and pressure ensembles in total 10 000
snapshots were recorded from the last simulation 200 snapshots were
evenly selected for the mm-pbsa-wsas binding free energy calculation
and 5000 were selected for the mm-gbsa ligandprotein binding
free energy decomposition analysis additional settings for constant
pressure md simulations performed in this work are listed as follows
temperature was regulated using langevin dynamics35
with a collision frequency of 5 ps1 pressure was
regulated using the isotropic position scaling algorithm with the
pressure relaxation time being set to 10 ps integration of the
equations of motion was conducted at a time step of 1 fs for the
relaxation phase and 2 fs for the equilibrium and sampling phases the
particle mesh ewald pme method36 was used to
calculate the full electrostatic energy of a unit cell in a
macroscopic lattice of repeating images all bonds were constrained
using the shake algorithm37 in both the
minimization and md simulation stages all md simulations were
performed using the pmemd program in amber 201834 a total of 200 md snapshots were evenly selected for the binding free
energy calculations for each selected md snapshot the molecular
mechanical mm energy emm and the
mm-pbsa solvation free energy were calculated without further
minimization810113840 key parameters
controlling the mm-pbsa-wsas analyses are listed as follows external
dielectric constant 80 internal dielectric constant 1 surface
tension for estimating the nonpolar solvation energy by using solvent
assessible surface area 0054 the parse radii41
were used in the mm-pbsa solvation calculation using the delphi
package httpcompbioclemsonedudelphi the entropic term was
estimated using a method coined wsas weighted solvent accessible
surface area described elsewhere4 it is noted
that the entropic contribution cannot be neglected for this protein
target as most ligands are large and have many rotatable bonds i conducted ligandresidue free energy decomposition analysis for
5000 snapshots evenly selected from the sampled snapshots besides the
electrostatic and van der waals interactions the solvation effect was
taken into account using a generalized gb model developed by hawkins
et al42 the ligandresidue mm-gbsa
interaction energies were calculated using the sander program in amber
201834 data analysis was performed using an
internal program developed by us a hot spot residue is recognized
when its ligandresidue mm-gbsa interaction is stronger than
10 kcalmol i first evaluated the docking power of glide program for the cocrystal
ligand of sars-cov-2 main protease n3 the ligand root mean square
deviation rmsd of the best docking pose based on docking score
94 33  was acceptable for a big ligand of about
100 atoms in flexible docking i then applied the docking setting to
conduct docking screenings all the drug molecules that had docking
scores better than 85 kcalmol roughly corresponding to 1
m were selected as hits and advanced to the next filter
mm-pbsa-wsas by utilizing this cutoff the number of hits accounted
for about 1 of total screening compounds for the promising docking hits i conducted molecular dynamics
simulations using the amber software package34 in
total 39 ligands including the cocrystal n3 ligand and 5 bioactives
that are structurally similar to lopinavir were studied in the second
phase of hvs the top 5 approved neutral drugs that have excellent
mm-pbsa-wsas binding free energies
gbind  50
kcalmol are shown in figure 1 the 2d structures of charged drugs with at least one
form achieving gbind 
50 kcalmol are shown in figure 2 i also found two bioactives figure 3 that have excellent
binding free energies section 33 it is noted that lopinavir was
observed to be effective in treating covid-19 patients i explored the md stability of each md system figure
4 showed the rmsd fluctuations
along the md simulation time it is shown that the main chain atoms of
the receptor black curves and the secondary structures red curves
reached equilibrium after 20 ns the least-squares ls fitted rmsds
of the ligands green curves are around 2  which is reasonable
for large ligands like sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors a
ligands no-fit rmsd was calculated by first performing
ls-fitting for the main chain atoms of the receptor and the resulting
translationrotation matrix was applied to the ligand and then
the rmsd was calculated directly evidently the ligand no-fit rmsd
measures not only the conformational changes but also its
translational and rotational movements inside the binding pocket the
ligand no-fit rmsds blue curves are larger than the ls-fit values
however those values around 34  are still acceptable
for large ligands it is pointed out that sometimes the ls-fit and
no-fit rmsd values are overestimated due to rotation of symmetrical
functional groups of a ligand in summary the rmsd fluctuation
analysis suggests that the md trajectories are overall stable during
the sampling phase for all the studied md systems i first generated the average structure of the collected snapshots and
then the md snapshot that had the smallest main chain atom rmsd
against the average structure was chosen as the representative
conformation the comparisons between the crystal structure and the
representative md conformations are shown in figure
5 for the native ligand n3 and in
figures 68 for the other ligands as
shown in figure 5 the
benzene motif located in the dashed red cycle was inserted between two
hot spot residues his41 and met49 for the md structure which is
quite distinct from the crystal structure which shows that the
benzene motif has no direct interactions with his41 and met49 i
believe that under physiological conditions the benzene motif becomes
less solvent exposed and has more favorable interactions with his41
and met49 by inserting itself between the side chains of the two
residues it is known that histidine has versatile roles in protein
interactions43 after the sulfide bond is
formed as a result of nucleophilic attack on catalytic cys145 by the
n3 ligand his41 can stabilize the ligandprotein interaction
by forming  stacking interactions between the
his41 and the benzene motif of n3 as shown below both his41 and
met49 were hot spot residues in my mm-gbsa free energy decomposition
analysis i measured the ligand binding affinity using the end point mm-pbsa
method considering that the ligands of sars-cov-2 main protease are
flexible molecules with large sizes the contribution of the binding
free energy from the conformational entropy change due to
proteinligand binding cannot be neglected instead of applying
normal-mode analysis to estimate the entropic effect i applied an
efficient method called wsas4 to calculate this
energy term this scoring function is therefore called mm-pbsa-wsas
the calculated binding free energies and the glide docking scores are
summarized in table 1 the
calculated entropic term ts
is quite different for different ligands as shown in table 1 suggesting the necessity of
including this term in binding free energy calculations the
structures of the promising drug repurposing candidates that have both
excellent docking scores and mm-pbsa-wsas binding affinities are shown
in figures 13 all the known drugs shown in figure 1 are neutral and have a better
mm-pbsa-wsas affinity than 50 kcalmol it should be noted
that the cocrystal ligand n3 is covalently bonded to the receptor
therefore its binding free energy is not directly comparable to those
noncovalent ligands the individual terms of mm-pbsa-wsas binding free
energies of other less potent ligands are summarized in table s1 the values of each energy term van der waals
evdw electrostatics
evdw 
gpb nonpolar solvation term
gsa and entropy
ts vary
significantly from one system to another table 1 and table s1 suggesting that there is no single energy
term that dominates the proteinligand interaction for the charged drug molecules caution should be taken in result
interpretation for example the neutral form of streptomycin
db01082 has a mm-pbsa-wsas binding free energy of 792
kcalmol much better than the charged form 382 kcalmol
the difference is caused by the distinct electrostatic properties
between the neutral and charged molecules however the charged form
is dominant under physiological conditions44 we
therefore should use the result of the charged form or take the
penalty of protonation into consideration when using the result of the
neutral form i performed mm-gbsa binding free energy decomposition to identify the hot
spot residues that make substantial contributions to the
proteinligand binding the identified hot spots could enable
us to rationally design potent and selective inhibitors of this drug
target to obtain statistically meaningful results i studied 5000 md
snapshots for each system and both the average ligandresidue

gligres and their
rmsd values were calculated a hot spot residue is defined as a residue with
gligres equal to or
smaller than 10 kcalmol the identified hot spots of each
ligand are summarized in table 2 the most significant hotspot residues

identification of multiple treatment plans as soon as possible
computational drug repurposing studies can provide treatment options in a
short period of time for this study amounts of computational time used for
individual tasks are as follows docking screenings of all 2201 approved
drugs with a single cpu core intel xeon cpu e5-2683 took 11 h for each
docking hit we need to perform ab initio calculations to
derive point charges the ab initio calculation using
wb97xd6-31ghf6-31g consumed about 1 day using four cpu cores then it
took us about 12 days to sample 120 ns using one gtx-1080 ti gpu the
following mm-pbsa-wsas calculation consumed 1 day therefore equipped with
sufficient numbers of cpus and gpus and the current hardware we can finish
the drug repurposing screenings within 4 to 5 days using a reliable hvs
strategy given that the inhibitors of sars-cov-2 main protease have
relatively large sizes the screening time can be even shorter for other
drug targets with smaller ligands another consideration is the availability of high-quality drug target
structures luckily a high-resolution crystal structure of sars-cov-2
protease in complex with a ligand was resolved quickly allowing us to
conduct this drug repurposing screening if no high-quality structure is
available one can rely on homology modeling techniques probably with a
reduced success rate of identifying repurposing drugs take sars-cov-2 main
protease as an example i performed structural alignments using an internal
program that takes a multiple-sequence-alignment msa as an input the msa
was generated by using the promals3d web server45 the
structure of sars-cov-2 main protease is found to be most similar to those
of sars-cov protease pdb 3tnt46 and less similar to mers-cov
protease pdb 5wkk47 figure 9a in comparison the structure of hepatitis
c virus hcv ns34a pdb code 3m5l48 is quite different from the main
proteases of coronaviruses the rmsd of 226  between hcv and
sars-cov-2 is much larger and with only 108 residues participating the
least-squares fitting figure 9b
i also compared the sequences of the four proteases around the seven hot
spot residues which are colored in red in table 3 it is shown that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov
share all seven hot spot residues mers-cov and sars-cov-2 have four of the
seven hot spot residues in common while hcv ns34a and sars-cov-2 have only
one hot spot residue his41 in common even though the sequence identity is
low between sars-cov-2 main protease and hcv ns34a as shown in figure 9b the cocrystal ligands
n3 green sticks for sars-cov-2 and itmn-191 brown sticks for hcv ns34a
largely overlap this suggests that homology models can be constructed using
modeller49 with sars-cov mers-cov and even hcv
ns34a as templates in this work we have conducted a computational drug repurposing study for the
sars-cov-2 main protease to find robust treatments of covid-19 particularly
after the virus has developed different variations it is necessary to
screen repurposing drugs targeting other proteins that are essential in the
life cycle of the virus in this study i took advantage of the recently released crystal structure of
sars-cov-2 main protease and conducted multiscale drug repurposing
screenings five neutral drugs namely carfilzomib eravacycline
valrubicin lopinavir and elbasvir are identified to have inhibitory
activities against sars-cov-2 main protease streptomycin a charged
molecule may also be an inhibitor of this sars-cov-2 main protease our
study suggests that computational drug repurposing screening is very
efficient and it can provide potential repurposing drug candidates in less
than 5 days a set of hot spot residues that make substantial contributions
to the proteinligand binding are also identified which can
facilitate rational design of novel selective inhibitors targeting
sars-cov-2 main protease  combating intracellular pathogens with repurposed
host-targeted drugs stanford schor shirit einav   there is an
urgent need for new strategies to combat hundreds of human disease-causing
intracellular pathogens including viruses intracellular bacteria
and protozoa currently approved antiviral drugs treat fewer than
ten viral infections while antibacterial agents are more widely available
only a minority of them penetrate mammalian cells and achieve a therapeutic
level in the appropriate intracellular compartment to treat intracellular
bacterial infections1 the narrow spectrum
of coverage of most antimicrobials that target microbial functions
particularly viruses is another major limitation given the high
average cost over two billion dollars and long timeline 812
years to develop a new drug the scalability of targeting microbes
individually is limited lastly resistance typically emerges rapidly
when conventional drugs that target microbial functions are used as
monotherapy an attractive solution to overcome these limitations
is to repurpose already approved drugs that target host functions
required for the lifecycle of intracellular pathogens as antimicrobial
agents figure 1 off-label use of approved
drugs requires significantly less capital and time and diminishes
the clinical risks because such drugs were already rigorously tested
toxicity pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics dosing etc for their
primary indication since some host functions are hijacked by various
viruses intracellular bacteria andor protozoa they may represent
targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials this approach can therefore
increase the efficiency of antimicrobial development improve drug
access for patients and facilitate readiness for future outbreaks
of emerging pathogens additionally host-targeted approaches may
have the added benefit of a higher genetic barrier to the emergence
of resistance one promising drug category
for repurposing as antimicrobials is inhibitors of host kinases such
as those widely approved for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory
conditions2 a large number of host kinases
are co-opted by intracellular pathogens and thus represent attractive
targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy3 indeed recent efforts have demonstrated the therapeutic
potential of kinase inhibitors to combat various intracellular microbial
infections the anticancer epidermal growth factor receptor egfr
andor erbb2 kinase inhibitors gefitinib erlotinib and lapatinib
demonstrate in vitro activity against a number of
viruses including hepatitis c virus hcv human cytomegalovirus hcmv
and poxvirus45 gefitinib and lapatinib also inhibit
hcv and hcmv infections in a mouse and guinea pig model respectively45 and reduce replication of mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb in the lungs of infected mice6 the antiviral effect of these drugs is mediated in part by inhibition
of signaling in the entry stage andor in f-actin-mediated intracellular
viral trafficking78 enhanced antimicrobial immune
effect via inhibition of egfrp38 mitogen associated protein kinase
signaling plays a role in their anti-mtb activity6 another class of approved kinase inhibitors demonstrating
a broad antimicrobial coverage is the cellular abelson tyrosine kinase
c-abl inhibitors such as imatinib and nilotinib these drugs inhibit
replication of ebola virus ebov dengue virus denv middle eastern
respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in cultured cells and reduce vaccinia
virus load spread and overall mortality in a mouse model912 moreover imatinib treatment impairs entry and intracellular survival
of mtb and mycobacterium marinum in infected macrophages
and reduces the bacterial load and associated pathologies in mice
infected with antibiotic-sensitive or resistant mtb13 notably when coadministered with rifamycins imatinib
displays synergy indicating its potential utility in combination
anti-mtb drug regimens13 the molecular
targets underlying the antimicrobial effect of c-abl inhibitors remain
to be validated moreover while inhibition of actin motility is proposed
as a mechanism of antiviral action of these drugs12 the precise mechanism and mode of antibacterial action
remain unknown the approved anticancer drugs sunitinib and
erlotinib display potent activity against viruses from six viral families
including denv and ebov in cultured cells14 combinations of these drugs reduce morbidity and mortality of dengue
and ebola infected mice and are advancing into clinical studies for
dengue and possibly ebola in future outbreaks httpsclinicaltrialsgov nct0238062514 inhibition of the cellular
kinases adaptor protein 2 ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1
and cyclin g-associated kinase gak regulators of adaptor protein-mediated
intracellular viral trafficking is an important mechanism of action
moa of this antiviral approach14 three approved immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinaseaktmammalian target of rapamycin pi3kaktmtor
pathway leflunomide everolimus and sirolimus reduce viremia and
nephropathy progression in patients infected with bk virus a member
of the polyomavirus family when used individually or in combination15 additionally leflunomide demonstrates activity
against hcmv both in vitro and in a rat model16 while direct suppression of viral replication
is proposed as one underlying mechanism of this approach the precise
moa and molecular targets remain unknown inhibitors of cyclophilin
a host factor that facilitates protein folding represent another
class of drugs beyond kinase inhibitors that shows promise as antimicrobials
cyclosporine an immunosuppressant cyclophilin inhibitor disrupts
replication of multiple viruses including hcv denv other flaviviruses
and human immunodeficiency virus hiv in vitro1718 two experimental nonimmunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors alisporivir
and scy-635 also inhibit multiple rna viruses in cultured cells
yet their effect in mouse models is variable19 alisporivir significantly reduced hcv viral load in chronically
infected patients19 however a clinical
hold was placed on the phase iii trial due to toxicity cyclosporine
also inhibits the erythrocytic stages of plasmodium falciparum
in vitro and rodent malaria in a mouse model20 nevertheless it remains unknown whether this
effect results in part from inhibition of the host cyclophilin or
solely the parasitic protein another candidate for repurposing
is nitazoxanide a drug approved for the treatment of parasite-induced
diarrhea it inhibits replication of multiple viruses including hcv
flaviviruses respiratory viruses hiv and hepatitis b virus hbv
in cultured cells21 nitazoxanide blocks
maturation of the influenza hemagglutinin but the target remains
unknown in the case of hcv it is thought to activate protein kinase
r leading to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2
which then blocks viral replication21 in
a phase ii trial nitazoxanide modestly reduced the time to resolution
of symptoms of flu and is currently being evaluated in a phase iii
trial for this indication22 whereas addition
of nitazoxanide to peginterferon-ribavirin improved the sustained
virologic response in hcv patients in a phase ii trial no such improvement
was observed in a phase iii trial in genotype 4 infected patients23 additionally nitazoxanide is effective against
clinical mtb isolates including those that are resistant to standard
antituberculosis drugs24 disruption of
membrane potential and ph homeostasis in mtb is one proposed moa24 a phase ii clinical trial is currently ongoing
to determine the efficacy of 14-day nitazoxanide treatment prior to
initiation of standard antituberculosis therapy metformin
a drug approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes inhibits the
intracellular growth of mtb including drug resistant strains and
enhances the efficacy of approved anti-mtb drugs in cell culture25 in a murine model metformin mildly reduces
mtb load in target organs and improves lung pathology when used individually
or in combination drug treatment25 notably
metformin demonstrated efficacy in decreasing disease severity and
improving clinical outcome as an adjunct therapy in retrospective
cohorts of tuberculosis patients with diabetes and also reduced the
incidence of latent tuberculosis in diabetic patients25 activation of the adenosine monophosphateactivated
protein kinase ampk which regulates cellular immune functions
is involved in mediating the antibacterial effect25 beyond tuberculosis a clinical study that aims to evaluate
the size of hiv reservoirs upon addition of metformin to antiretroviral
regimens is currently ongoing statins drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme a reductase hmg-coar represent another potential class
for repurposing as host-targeted antimicrobials various statins inhibit
replication of hcv and denv in vitro2627 nevertheless while several retrospective studies demonstrated that
statins reduce relapse rates in patients infected with hcv when added
to peginterferon-ribavirin this effect was quite variable27 the mechanism of anti-hcv action of statins
is mediated in part by their effect on lipid biosynthesis as their
antiviral activity in cells is reversed upon addition of mevalonate
or geranylgeraniol and resistance to these drugs coincides with an
increase in hmg-coar level27 due to their
ability to restore endothelial stability statins were also proposed
as a strategy to treat infections associated with endothelial dysfunction
while no formal study has been conducted it was reported that atorvastatin
in combination with an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced mortality
in 100 ebola patients in sierra leone28 the antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug chloroquine also
shows some promise as an antimicrobial agent in a nonhuman primate
dengue model chloroquine reduces viremia cytokine production and
organ damage29 however when studied in
dengue patients it reduced pain and improved daily activity performance
yet it did not reduce disease duration or viremia3031 in mice infected with zika virus chloroquine increases the life
span and reduces vertical transmission and fetal brain infection32 moreover it reduces acute lung injury morbidity
and mortality in a mouse model of avian influenza a h5n133 the mechanism of antiviral activity of chloroquine
is multifaceted and thought to involve alterations in the intracellular
ph causing impaired fusion and cleavage of the prm protein during
flaviviral release andor inhibition of autophagy3233 chloroquine may also show utility as an add-on to antituberculosis
regimens as it enhances the intracellular killing of mtb in human
macrophages by inhibiting the bcrp-1 breast cancer resistance protein-1-mediated
active efflux of the antituberculosis drugs isoniazid and pyrazinamide34 collectively these data provide a proof-of-concept
for the useful expansion of antimicrobial drug targets by focusing
on host functions and for the therapeutic potential of repurposed
drugs targeting these functions to combat intracellular pathogens
further benefit is provided by the higher genetic barrier to resistance
associated with many of these host-targeted approaches whereas emergence
of resistance can complicate treatment with host-targeted approaches
as in the case of the chemokine receptor 5 antagonist maraviroc35 the time to resistance with other host-targeted
approaches is longer and the level of resistance is lower relative
to typical direct-acting antimicrobials monotherapy this is exemplified
by treatment of denv with sunitiniberlotinib combinations mtb with
nitazoxanide and hcv with cyclophilin inhibitors141924 targeting host proteins that are not under
the genetic control of microbes and simultaneously inhibiting several
host targets with the same drug or drug combination are thought to
facilitate this increase in the resistance barrier of these approaches nevertheless repurposing of host-targeted drugs as antimicrobials
faces its own challenges cellular proteins function in a complex
network of interactions and their inhibitors are often nonselective
thus the mechanism of antimicrobial action of host-targeted approaches
often remains elusive and the molecular targets underlying this effect
are unvalidated for example erlotinibs effect on hcv infection
was first attributed solely to its effect on egfr its cancer target
yet it was later demonstrated that inhibition of gak another target
that is inhibited by erlotinib with a comparable potency to egfr
also plays a role814 for other drugs such as nitazoxanide
and chloroquine the moa is even less clear and appears to be pathogen
specific21243234 another challenge is that the antimicrobial effect observed in vitro often cannot be reproduced in vivo for example several multi kinase inhibitors such as lestaurtinib
display in vitro activity against plasmodium
falciparum but no significant effect in malaria-infected
mice36 moreover as exemplified by chloroquine
for dengue treatment a promising effect in animal models cannot guarantee
an effect in patients2931 toxicity is another major concern the src- and c-abl-inhibitor
dasatinib demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral activity in cultured
cells yet in a murine model of vaccinia virus it induces immunosuppression
rather than protection1237 it is thus important
to investigate the antimicrobial activity and safety of these drugs
in animal models of other infections nevertheless for some drugs
it may be feasible to find a therapeutic window where the drug level
is sufficient to inhibit microbial replication with minimal cellular
toxicity shifting from indications requiring long-term therapy eg
months to years for cancer to a shorter duration sufficient to treat
most acute infections should help limit toxicity in contrast the
utility of some of these approaches for treating chronic infections
requiring longer duration treatment may be more limited this is exemplified
by the unexpected occurrence of pancreatitis during the phase iii
trial with alisporivir in chronically infected hcv patients nevertheless
drugs that are extensively used in humans such as metformin and chloroquine
are more likely to be safe add-ons to standard regimens even for chronic
infections in summary these examples provide a proof-of-concept
for the potential feasibility of repurposing approved drugs as host-targeted
broad-spectrum therapies to combat intracellular microbial pathogens
to effectively meet the clinical needs posed by emerging intracellular
pathogens such approaches may find utility in combination with novel
host-targeted approaches and microbial-targeted strategies  repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for covid-19 using deep learning xiangxiang zeng xiang song tengfei ma xiaoqin pan yadi zhou yuan hou zheng zhang george karypis feixiong cheng  there have been more than 850000 confirmed cases and over 48000 deaths from the human coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 in the united states alone however there are currently no proven effective medications against covid-19 drug repurposing offers a promising way for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for covid-19 this study reports an integrative network-based deep learning methodology to identify repurposable drugs for covid-19 termed cov-kge specifically we built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs diseases genes pathways and expressions from a large scientific corpus of 24 million pubmed publications using amazons aws computing resources we identified 41 repurposable drugs including indomethacin toremifene and niclosamide whose therapeutic association with covid-19 were validated by transcriptomic and proteomic data in sars-cov-2 infected human cells and data from ongoing clinical trials while this study by no means recommends specific drugs it demonstrates a powerful deep learning methodology to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation which holds the potential of accelerating therapeutic development for covid-19  as of april 22 2020  there have been more than 850000 confirmed cases and over 48000 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the disease caused by the virus sars-cov-2 in the united states alone 1 however there are currently no proven effective antiviral medications against covid-19 2 there is an urgent need for the development of effective treatment strategies for covid-19 traditional de novo drug discovery was estimated that pharmaceutical companies spent 26 billion in 2015 for the development of an fda-approved new chemical entity drug 3 drug repurposing a drug discovery strategy from existing drugs offers an promising way for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for covid-19 4 in a randomized controlled open-label trial 5 prior knowledge of networks from large scientific corpus of publications offers a deep biological perspective for capturing the relationships between drugs genes and diseases including covid-19 yet extracting connections from a large-scale repository of structured medical information is challenging in this study we present the state-of-the-art knowledge graph-based deep learning methodologies for rapid discovery of drug candidates to treat covid-19 from 24 million pubmed publications via systematic validation using transcriptomics and proteomics data generated from sars-cov-2 infected human cells and the ongoing clinical trial data we successfully identified 41 drug candidates that can be further tested in large-scale randomized control trials for potential treatment of covid-19 pipeline of cov-kge 5 here we present a knowledge graph-based deep learning methodology for drug repurposing in covid-19 termed cov-kge figure 1  our method uses dgl-ke developed by our amazons aws ai laboratory 13  to efficiently learn embeddings of large knowledge graphs specifically we construct a knowledge graph from 24 million pubmed publications 14 and drugbank 15  including 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs diseases genes anatomies pharmacologic classes geneprotein expression and others cf supplementary tables 1 and 2  in this knowledge graph we represent the coronaviruses covs by assembling multiple types of known covs including sars-cov-1 mers-cov hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 as described in our recent study 9  we next utilize dgl-kes knowledge graph embedding model rotate 16  to learn representations of the entities eg drugs and targets and relationships eg inhibition relation between drugs and targets in an informative low-dimensional vector space in this space each relationship type eg antagonists or agonists is defined as a rotation from the source entity eg hydroxychloroquine to the target entity eg toll-like receptor 79 tlr79 cf methods after mapping drugs covs and the treatment relationships to a complex vector space using rotate the top-100 most relevant drugs are selected as 6 candidate for covs in the treatment relation space supplementary figure   1  using the ongoing covid-19 trial data httpscovid19-trialscom as a validation set cov-kge has the larger area under the receive operating characteristic curve auroc  085 figure 2  in identifying repurposable drugs for covid-19 we next employ t-sne t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm 17  to further investigate the low-dimensional node representation learned by cov-kge specifically we project drugs grouped by the first-level of the anatomical therapeutic chemical atc classification systems code onto two-dimensional space figure 3a indicates that cov-kge is able to distinguish 14 types of drugs grouped by atc codes consistent with a high table 3  we next turn to highlight three types of predicted drugs for covid-19 including antiinflammatory agents selective estrogen receptor modulators serms and antiparasitics  figure 3a  given the well-described lung pathophysiological characteristics and immune responses cytokine storms of severe covid-19 patients drugs that dampen the immune responses may offer effective treatment approaches for covid-19 18 19 as shown in figure 3a  we computationally identified multiple antiinflammatory agents for covid-19 including indomethacin and melatonin indomethacin an approved cyclooxygenases coxs inhibitor has been widely used for its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties 20  indomethacin has been reported to have antiviral properties including sars-cov-1 20  and sars-cov-2 21  importantly preliminary in vivo observation showed that oral indomethacin 1 mgkg body weight daily reduced the recovery time of sars-cov-2 infected dogs 21 melatonin plays a key role in the regulation of human circadian rhythm that alters the translation of thousands of genes including melatonin-mediated anti-inflammatory and 8 immune-related effects for covid-19 melatonin has various antiviral activities by suppressing multiple inflammatory pathways 22 23 including il6 il-1 and tnf etc --these inflammatory effects are directly relevant given the welldescribed lung pathophysiological characteristics of severe covid-19 patients the melatonins mechanism-of-action may also help explain the epidemiologic observation that children who have naturally high melatonin levels are relatively resistant to covid-19 disease manifestations while older individuals who have decreasing melatonin levels with age are a very high-risk population 24 in addition exogenous melatonin administration may be of particular benefit to older patients given an aging-related reduction of endogenous melatonin levels and vulnerability of older individuals to the lethality of sars-cov-2 24 an overexpression of estrogen receptor has played a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication and infection 25 several selective estrogen receptor modulators serms including clomifene bazedoxifene and toremifene are identified as promising candidate drugs for covid-19  figure 3b  toremifene the first generation of nonsteroidal serm was reported to block various viral infections at low micromolar concentration including ebola virus 26 27  mres-cov 28  sars-cov-1 29  and sars-cov-2 30 figure 3a  toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus glycoprotein and eventually blocking replications of the ebola virus 26 the underlying antiviral mechanisms 9 of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 for toremifene remains unclear and are currently being investigated toremifene has been approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer 31 and has also been studied in men with prostate cancer 1500 subjects with reasonable tolerability 32 toremifene is 99 bound to plasma protein with good bioavailability and typically administered at a dosage of 60 mg orally 33 in summary toremifene offers a promising candidate drug with ideal pharmacokinetics properties to be tested in covid-19 clinical trials directly hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate two approved antimalarial drugs though lacking strong clinical evidence were authorized by the us fda for treatment of covid-19 patients using emergency use authorizations 2 in this study we identified that both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are among the predicted candidates for covid-19  figure 3a  between the two hydroxychloroquines in vitro antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 is stronger than that of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine 50 effective concentration ec50  614 m where chloroquine ec50  2390 m 34  hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are known to increase the ph of endosomes which inhibits membrane fusion a required mechanism for viral entry including sars-cov-2 into the cell 19  additionally the potential benefit replicates poorly in multiple animals including dogs pigs chickens and ducks which limits preclinical animal studies 39  in this study we present cov-kge a powerful integrated ai methodology that can be used to quickly identify drugs that can be repurposed for the potential treatment of covid-19 our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the covid-19 pandemic from a translational perspective if broadly applied the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other emerging infectious diseases and other emerging complex diseases as well in this study we constructed a comprehensive knowledge graph kg from gnbr 14 and drugbank 41  first from gnbr we included in the kg relations corresponding to drug-gene interactions gene-gene interactions drugdisease associations and gene-disease associations second from 12 drugbank we selected the drugs whose molecular mass is greater than 230 daltons and also exist in gnbr-resulting in 3481 fda-approved and clinically investigational drugs for these drugs we included in the kg relationships corresponding to the drug-drug interactions and the drug-sideeffects drug atc codes drug-mechanism-of-action drug-pharmacodynamics and drug-toxicity associations third we included the experimentally discovered coronaviruses-gene relationships from our recent work in the kg 9 fourth we treated the covid-19 context by assembling six types of table 2  models for computing knowledge graph embeddings learn vectors for each of the entities and each of the relation types so that they satisfy certain properties in our work we learned these vectors using the rotate model 42 given an edge in the knowledge graph represented by the triplet head-entity relation-type and tail-entity rotate defines each relation type as a rotation from the head entity to tail entity in the complex vector space specifically if 13   are the vectors corresponding to the head and tail entities respectively and  is the

promising treatment approach for covid-19 which is warranted to be tested in the randomized controlled trials further   mapping the global research and clinical trials in covid-19 ranjana aggarwal sujit bhattacharya shubham singh  covid-19 has created an unprecedented level of research and innovation activity globally to bring out drug to control or cure the disease and develop vaccine for long time prevention a newbetter normal is emerging that is trying to push this time period for drug development and vaccine within a year and earlier than that from typical 8 to 10 years for drugs and 10 to 15 years for vaccine this is happening due to multiple factors strong policy push by different government that includes dedicated investment speeding up regulation process multiple agencies involvement and multilateral bodies led by who trying to create a global platform huge grants from private funding bodies strategic linkages across the whole research and innovation value chain between firms academic research organisations and start-ups the paper maps the research papers and ongoing clinical trials to provide an informed view of the current status of the research and drug development activity as seen through the lens of research papers and clinical trials the intended goal of this study is to help the research community and policy makers to keep track of highly relevant research and drug development in covid-19  the intended goal of this study is to help the research community and policy makers to keep track of highly relevant research and drug development as seen through the lens of clinical trials in covid-19 since the pandemic began there were large number of studies trying to understand the structure of the virus transmission and the mitigation measures the studies helped to identify the key facts of the virus initial response for containing the virus efficacy of measures such as face masks hand hygiene to reduce the reproduction number of the virus etc 1 2 the focus has now shifted to clinical research and various organisations are collaborating to develop a cure for the virus or reduce the mortality rate many clinical trials are centered on repurposed drugs this repurposing strategy old drugs new use is emerging as the most preferred strategy to bring a drug quickly to the market for treatment of this disease or address specific conditions that is emerging due to it the rationale behind this strategy ie repurposing strategy is driven by sound logic drug development is a long process that covers clinical trials at different phase from preclinical animal testing for efficacy and toxicity to clinical trials at different phases i to iii it includes testing of drugs on healthy persons for safety phase i on patients to assess efficacy phase ii further large scale testing to assess efficacy effectiveness and safety phase iii the chances of failures are high at different stages which sinks the cost that was incurred keeping all these factors in consideration it is estimated that a new drug to reach the market costs 800 million to 1000 million 3 as a recent study in lancet 4 cautions clinical trial literature is riddled with drugs that looked promising in small trials only to prove ineffective in bigger more rigorous studies the present pandemic calls for quick interventions thus due to urgent need to bring a drug to the market and the uncertainties involved repurposed drug becomes a much safer pathway availability of the safety data along with addressing similar conditions and broad spectrum is available for these drugs as they are tested previously on other diseases and hence their clinical trials testing is accelerated 5 clinical trials thus can be much shorter and more directed and can have combination of phases for repurposed drugs the clinical trials can concentrate on phase ii onwards thus repurposed drugs can be much faster to bring to the market thus it is not surprising to see this as the most common strategy adopted by research institutionsuniversities and firms for covid-19 many repurposed drugs that are part of clinical trials can be distinguished by promising results for earlier coronavirus diseases sars-cov-1 or mers or drugs that were effective antivirals solidarity trials undertaken by the who is also a repositioning drug strategy conducted on four drugs remdesivir lopinavirritonavir lopinavirritonavir with interferon beta-1a clinical trials of these drugs are being undertaken in multiple countries that have given consent to this approach for treatments who claims that thisglobal coordinated clinical trials will reduce the time taken by randomised clinical trials by 80 many drugs that were not so effective earlier in terms of success for the condition for which it was developed are also being revisited for this disease this is another type of repurposing a good example of this is the gilead sciences drug remdesivir which is found to inhibit the activity of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 2 of sars-cov-2 6 the drug according to scavone et al 7 was initially developed as a treatment for ebola and marburg infections but did not demonstrate clinical efficacy now is used in the covid-19 treatment national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid is also conducting clinical trials on remdesivir which is a multicentre randomised placebo controlled phase 3 trial other methods like convalescent plasma therapy and antibodies treatment are also showing promising results convalescent plasma is seen to be a prominent intervention in the clinical trials it is a passive antibody therapy in which blood from the recovered patients is taken and transfused in a covid-19 patient the treatment was advised previously by who in treatment of ebola and mers diseases 8 studies that support this line of treatment for covid-19 include the study published in lancet 9 which states the viral load on patients after convalescent plasma treatment was significantly lower on days 3 5 and 7 after intensive care unit admission the study also pointed out the reduction in risk of mortality and suppression of viramia presence of virus in the bloodstream all the convalescent plasma trials are in advanced stages of clinical trials owing to quick approvals of this treatment as no severe adverse effects are seen to have been associated with this treatment elliy lilly has developed an antibody ly-cov555 which targets sars-cov-2 spike protein using plasma from recovered patients to treat others who have developed this disease is another active line of treatment according to gul et al 10 convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in covid-19 another line of research is for developing a quick and effective vaccine for this various vaccine models are used like weakened or inactivated virus model dna or rna vaccines viral vector vaccines or vaccines based on protein subunits spike proteins etc or virus like particles empty virus shells without genetic material an interesting insight of the vaccine development landscape can be seen from the whos draft landscape of covid-19 candidate vaccines 11 a total of 133 vaccines candidates are in development around the world ten of these are in clinical evaluation and 123 in pre-clinical evaluation the paper focusses on global research and drug development a successful vaccine is most effective for prevention of this disease and it can prevent this type of pandemic we are seeing the paper thus has this limitation as it does not capture the ongoing clinical trials for vaccine development of this disease the study attempts to capture the influential research and insights of ongoing clinical trials surrounding covid-19 it attempts to address the following research questions  to capture the key research papers and their characterisation  to draw insights from ongoing clinical trials based on the above we envisaged to draw policy implications for research and innovation surrounding this pandemic the data for this study was drawn from dimensions database wwwdimensionsai an integrated linked database that provides data of funding agencies grant research publications patents clinical trials and key policy documents the database captures clinical trials database from a number of international clinical trials registry and contains 557322 clinical trials data the covid-19 research papers and clinical trials were extracted from dimensions database using the search string covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or sars-cov2 or 2019-ncov on 2 june 2020 from this database in the full text global research papers and clinical trials trends were also collected from 22 may 2020 to 2 june 2020 using the above search string altmetrics or article level metrics was chosen as the popularity qualifier field of research for classification available on dimensions database was chosen as the research paper classifier this diverse nature of for classification system unlike other systems available in dimensions like rcdc which is completely biomedical provided the basis for its selection the 15 most frequently occurring for categories in the covid-19 papers were identified from theabove168 classifications available the papers under these categories were mapped to show some insights of the dispersion of the papers across key research themes a paper could be placed in more than one category and thus summing up the counting of papers across categories would be considerably more than the total papers through altmetrics score top 10 most popular papers were identified data for twitter news facebook and blog mentions was collected from altmetricscom audience and country where the paper is most popular was based on the type of tweeter public scientists practitioners a total of 3428 clinical trials were extracted on 2 june 2020 co-occurrence map of 42 interventions occurring atleast 4

drugvaccine development is the primary reason behind the intensity and large volume of research fast tracking of covid-19 research by various journals and quick availability on pre-print servers has also played a major role in this increase it was found that as many as 168 for classification category covered the research papers from medical and health sciences clinical sciences to economics this shows the wide impact of this disease as it in a sense motivates research activity across so many diverse domains disciplinessub-disciplines research papers are an indication of this dispersion of research activity figure 2 highlights the main domains wherein research papers are visible the above figure underscores again the wide diversity in terms of research topics being covered the papers fall into more than one topic so the total count is much higher than the overall papers the distribution topic wise shows along with research in various medical aspects of the disease there is also intense research in economic and social aspects of it a further examination of the ten most popular papers table 1 and their content analysis provide deeper insight into this disease  cc-by-nc 40

httpsdoiorg1011012020062720141788 doi medrxiv preprint the content analysis of the papers underscores in a sense what has been the influential aspect of the paper that has distinguished it from the large repository of papers surrounding this disease it is also interesting to note that of the 10 popular papers as many as 6 papers have remained in the top ten papers over a period of time these papers indicated by start mark in the table this further demonstrates their impact anderson et al 2020  the study most popular on social media platforms number of tweets more than three times the next popular paper showed that sars-cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus to infect humans on the basis of comparative analysis of genomic features of sars-cov-2 with other alpha and beta coronaviruses the authors claimed that this virus is optimized for binding to the human receptor ace2 and the spike proteins of this virus has a polybasic furin cleavage site at s1-s2 boundary which may be important to determine its impact on transmissibility and pathogenesis in animal models it further claimed that sars-cov-2 is not a product of purposeful manipulation most likely the result of natural selection of human or human-like ace2 receptor the different aspects covered by this disease can be seen highly important and thus contributed to its online impact van doremelen et al 2020 analysed the aerosol and surface stability of sars-cov-2 and compared it with sars-cov-1 the most closely related human coronavirus the study highlighted the need to protect from five environmental conditions aerosols plastic stainless steel copper and cardboard further it showed that sars-cov-2 remains viable in aerosols for 3 hours on plastic and stainless steel for 3 days 4 hours on copper and on cardboard for 24 hours the study found that the stability of sars-cov-1 is similar on plastic stainless steel and aerosols to sars-cov-2 and different to sars-cov-2 on cardboard 8 hours and copper 8 hours it was also indicated that though the stability of both viruses is similar both show exponential decay in virus titer the difference in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses may arise due to high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for infected persons to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic the implications of this study can be clearly seen in the preventive measures of covid-19 this study was also cited in policy documents leung et al 2020 explored the importance of respiratory droplet and aerosol route of transmission by quantifying the amount of respiratory virus namely coronavirus influenza virus and rhinoivirus in exhaled breath of participants that have acute respiratory virus illness ari the 246 participants were divided in two groups one wearing surgical face mask and other not wearing face mask the study found that surgical face masks can efficaciously reduce the respiratory droplet emission of influenza virus particles but not in aerosols they also found that surgical face masks can be used by ill patients of covid-19 to reduce onward transmission face mask is getting increasing attention and now being incorporated as essential guideline in health policies of different countries the paper provided a good empirical support to this ie face masks  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the

estimated that the undocumented cases contagiousness or transmission rate was 55 of documented infections yet 79 of documented infection cases were due to these undocumented infections the suggestion of this study that undocumented infections isolation and identification is necessary to fully control the virus is very important and the spread of this virus may be seen as a consequence of this this study also was cited in policy documents caly et al 2020 reported that ivermectin an fda approved broad spectrum parasitic agent previously shown to have anti-viral activity against a broad range of viruses in vitro inhibits the sars-cov-2 the study found that a single dose of ivermectin added to vero-hslam cells 2-hours post infection with sars-cov-2 isolate australiavi012020 2 was able to reduce the viral rna by approximately 5000-fold within 24-48 hours they also hypothesized the mode of action through inhibiting imp1-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins doctors are struggling to control this dangerous disease a study like this which gives some hope is quickly tracked which is indicated by its high altmetrics score shen et al 2020 study examined convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody transfusion benefit in treatment of critically ill covid-19 patients the clinical trial was conducted on 5 critically ill patients with covid-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards along with certain other conditions the study found decline in viral load clinical conditions of patients improved as indicated by body temperature reduction improved pao 2 fio 2 and chest imaging though the sample size is limited and requires further clinical trials for potential effectiveness but this treatment is now being incorporated in many countries bendavid et al reported a new dimension to address epidemic models projections and public policies on covid-19 on the basis of measurement of seroprevalence of antibodies to sars-cov-2 in santa clara county using lateral flow immunoassay a world health organization protocol for covid-19 antibody testing serological testing was conducted for sars-cov-2 antibodies in a sample of 3300 people selected on the basis of three data elements zip code of residence sex and ethnicityrace on the basis of seroprevalence data of antibodies to sars-cov-2 between 249 to 416 among the population they estimated that the number of infections is much higher of the order of 50-85 fold in santa clara than indicated by the number of confirmed cases and the fatality rate is 012-02 which is much lower than the reported average increase of 6 daily as of april 10 2020 this wellmeasured data on population prevalence estimates provided important understanding to calibrate epidemic stage calculate fatality rates and frame public policy decisions the paper is attracting attention of several research groups worldwide who are testing population samples for sars-cov-2 antibodies and citing this paper frequently kampf et al provided a comprehensive review on the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on different type of inanimate surfaces as well as their inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used in surface disinfectants the data showed that human coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and endemic human coronavirus strain hcov-229e can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces like steel aluminium metal wood paper glass plastic  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

from 2 hours to 9 days it also captured the effect of temperature humidity and concentration of inocculum viral titter on the persistence of coronavirus inactivation of these coronaviruses by a variety of commonly used biocidal agents namely ethanol 78-95 2-propanol 70-100 combination of 1-and 2-propanols 45 and 30 glutardialdehyde 05-25 benzalkonium chloride 005-02 chlorohexidine digluconate 002 sodium hypochlorite 0001-021 hydrogen peroxide 05 formaldehyde 0009-1 and povidone iodine 023-4 has also been compiled the study indicated that the most efficient disinfectants to inactivate these viruses on the surfaces within 1 minute are 62-71 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite and are also expected to disinfect sars cov-2 similarly as no antiviral treatment for sars-cov-2 has been proven to be effective till date contamination and prevention of further spread is the key strategy to stop the ongoing outbreak this review article gained popularity as it provided inputs about the best disinfectants to be used to ensure disinfection of frequently touched surfaces hand hygiene in healthcare set ups and for public usages at large to combat the spread of pandemic some of the important features highlighted in this article about the illness were most of the infected patients were men 73 with less than half having co-morbidities like diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease 66 patients had direct exposure to huanan seafood market most patients suffered with fever dry cough dyspnoea fatigue and bilateral groundglass opacities on chest ct scans and only a few with haemoptysis and diarrhoea the pathophysiological studies of patients infected with 2019-ncov indicated that amount of proinflammatory cytokines il1b ifn  ip10 and mcp1 and tnf responsible for pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage were increased in serum patients with higher concentrations of gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf required icu admission suggesting that cytokine storm was associated with disease severity this article gained significance as it was one the earliest reports to provide evidence based information on common complications associated with infection with covid 19 and the line of treatment adopted by the doctors in wuhan kissleret al projected sars-cov-2 transmission model for the pandemic period using time series data from the usa for betacoronaviruses namely oc43 and hku1the assessments were based on role of seasonal variation duration of immunity and cross immunity on the transmissibility of these two viruses through model simulations they predicted some patterns of outbreaks substantial outbreaks in autumnwinter than winterspring annual outbreaks if sars-cov-2 establishes short-term immunity on the order of 40 weeks while biennial for long term immunity of two years seasonal variation in sars-cov-2 differ between geographical locations as for influenza decline or elimination of incidences of betacoronaviruses if sars-cov-2 induces 70 cross immunity against hcov-43 and hcov-hku1 elimination of transmission for upto three years if low level of cross immunity 30 is induced after the initial most severe pandemic wave complimentary interventions such as expanding critical care demand and effective therapeutics along with success of social distancing would hasten the acquisition of herd immunity the study emphasized the urgency of longitudinal serological studies to be undertaken to determine the extent and duration of immunity of sars-cov-2 and epidemiological surveillance to be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgence the study is important as it gives valuable inputs for the prediction of outbreaks so that world is better prepared in terms of healthcare therapeutics and economic front to deal with it effectively as the content analysis highlights each of the paper covers various aspects of the disease from understanding the structure of the virus effect of the disease complications conditions the way it spreads and interventions that can be effective to contain its spread drugstreatments that show initial promise the research papers have influenced the drug development process as they have provided initial evidencepathway they have also influenced government intervention measures to prevent the spread and contain the disease some evidence of this also comes from the various altmetric measures as on june 8 2020 there are 3581clinical trials on covid-19 however for some details were not available during this period there were 1659intervention based clinical trials and 1727 observational clinical trials 129 retrospective studies 5 new treatment measure clinical study figure 3 shows the key 42 interventions occurring in at least 4 clinical trials  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 29 2020  the values in brackets show the frequency of these interventions the thickness of the linkages shows the strength with which two interventions are linked together deeper analysis based on of the linkages as shown by the map draws attention to some key insights of the ongoing clinical research one can observe hydroxychloroquine azithromycin remdesivir and tozilizumab prominently visible in the map all these drugs are repurposed drugs the clinical trials are being undertaken to find out their efficacy for the treatment of covid-19 the drugs remedesvir lopinavirritonavir chloroquine and hydroxychoroquine both currently and previously included in the who solidarity trials can be seen in the co-occurrence map strong linkage of these drug trials to placebo underscores that trails are not open labels wherein participants know the treatment they are getting the variation in placebo types may indicate the different drug delivery route as placebo cant be different from that each of the topic keyword present in the map and their co-occurrence highlight the different aspects of the clinical trials umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells uc msc for example is also now used to reduce mortality and morbidity among severe covid-19 patients 12 keeping in view the plausible adverse impact of the repurpose drugs they are being administered along with following standard of care standard care protocol this explains the occurrence of standard care in this map the map thus speaks to a large audience looking more closely at the map we find repurposed drugs as well as new trials primarily belong to the category of antiviral drug antiviral drugs were also the first repurposed drugs against sars-cov-2 infection antivirals targets the virus life cycle at stages like host cell binding uncoating synthesis and translation of viral mrna release of newly synthesised virus etc 13 due to these activities of the antivirals they can be used for prophylaxis virus suppression preventing severe outcomes in patients etc hydroxychloroquine an antimalarial drug has shown to have antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 one can trace the key studies that may have motivated the clinical trial the strong linkage seen between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is a result of ongoing clinical trial using this drug combination this can be traced to the study by gautret et al 14 that the combination of these two drugs was significantly more efficient for virus elimination similarly research studies also have led to a drug being dropped or provide a caution to ongoing trail this can be seen in case of hydroxychloroquine linkages seen in the map such as between ivermectin-chloroquine ivermectin-hydroxychloroquine point out that clinical trials of these drugs are being done together in a synergistic manner senanayake 15 offered a perspective that antiviral combinations with a double hit effect may offer the best chance of success and clinical translatability ivermectin an antiparasitic drug is shown by caly et al 16 to reduce viral replication on the other hand hydroxychloroquine according to patri and fabbrocini 17 could interfere with the glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which can reduce the binding efficiency of sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 of host cells hence their combination could act in consequential and synergistic manner 17 a closer look at why linkages are observed between lopinavir-ritonavir and remdesivir hydroxychloroquine-remdesivir require a deeper analysis these types of combinations are happening because some clinical trials are using various arms in a single trial in other words these trials are using single or various drug combinations in a clinical trial solidarity trails are also using this strategy the national institute of health nih has recommended remdesivir in spo2  94 on ambient air at sea level and for patients who are on mechanical ventilation the drug however according to nih has insufficient data backing to recommend it for mild to moderate patients many trials for example of asan medical center trial id  nct04307693 has three arms lopinavirritonavir experimental arm hydroxychloroquine active comparator arm and control arm no intervention this phase 2 trial divides each arm in 111 ratio and tries to compare the effectiveness of these drugs to reduce viral load several other trials are also using arms of 5-6 drugs in their studies therefore the linkages pattern between these drugs is seen it was found that sars-cov-2 interferes with the blood pressure maintaining hormone angiotensin ii leading to high blood pressure and lung damage 18 losartan a blood pressure medication and part of the dark blue cluster is being tested to block the hormone thereby preventing lung damage it is observed in patients that the inflammation triggering protein interleukin-6 il-6 cytokine is overexpressed resulting in cytokine storms this can lead to hyper-inflammation thus causing damage to lung and other organs which can be life threatening therefore tocilizumab which can block cellular receptors for interleukin-6 il-6 19 is being used in the clinical trials to prevent cytokine storms in patients thus the maps bring out some salient characteristics of ongoing clinical trials and provides important signals a very intensive research activity and clinical trials can be observed surrounding covid-19 the present paper attempts to capture salient aspects of the ongoing research and clinical trials drawing from the huge volume of ongoing research papers and clinical trials using sophisticated analytical tools the research trend influential papers and map of ongoing clinical trials that dominate the overall landscape of clinical trials were identified informed assessment was made by undertaking content analysis of the influential papers and exploring the rationale behind the linkages observed and their implications the trends of global research and clinical trials shows the speed at which extensive research and clinical trials is undertaken to understand the various aspects of this disease and finding an effective treatment for the disease the ten most influential papers identified based on their altmetric score show that they have actively been covered in news and policy documents another common characteristic of these papers are they have been published in highly reputed journal which plausibly was also a factor in attracting high online influence other indicators highlight the dissemination of these papers in the diverse community from public practitioners to scientists this type of fast and diverse dissemination of research papers underscores the importance of this research for academics practitioners and society content analysis of these ten influential papers draw attention to the importance of these papers in identifying virus characteristic drug

clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine 370 completed trials unreported favipiravir 778 and lopinavir 405 there is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for covid-19 this uncertainty could cause a large burden of additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic we recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a pandemic infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 its global spread has been rapid and unprecedented at the time of writing 5335868 confirmed cases have been reported and 341549 deaths across 188 countries 1  currently treatment options for covid-19 are limited however several drugs developed for other indications have shown promising results against sars-cov-2 in vitro in animal models or in compassionate use trials 2 3  many of these drugs are now being experimentally repurposed for covid-19 or are undergoing clinical trials in humans 4  such candidates include nitazoxanide remdesivir favipiravir lopinavir darunavir hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and ivermectin amongst others 5  investigations into the efficacy of these experimental treatments for covid-19 are ongoing meanwhile in response to positive media coverage some speculative rather than evidence-based governments are stockpiling vast supplies of these treatments in anticipation of their licensing for covid-19 furthermore national regulatory institutions meant to safeguard against the unsafe use of drugs are under increasing pressure to relax approval standards to accelerate market-entry for covid-19 treatments for example on april 27 th 2020 the us food and drug administration fda approved the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine for emergency treatment of covid-19 with unknown optimal dosage and duration of treatment 6  however the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is still under question 7  furthermore it is cardiotoxic at the higher doses which may be indicated for covid-19 causing qt prolongation leading to ventricular tachycardia and death 8  care must be taken not to lose the rigorous safety standards usually stipulated for pharmaceuticals even during a pandemic to avoid unnecessary morbidity and mortality worldwide given the pandemic status of covid-19 it is more important than ever that safety information for drugs potentially being repurposed is publicly available pharmacokinetics for many drugs differ by phenotype examples include ace inhibitors which are cautioned in people of african descent and dolutegravir which causes greater weight gain in women than men 9 10  as pharmaceutical companies often run trials in high income countries treatment cohorts are often largely white 11  furthermore regulatory authorities are often conservative about including pregnant women in trials discouraging female recruitment 11  as experimental treatments for covid-19 may be distributed to millions of people worldwide maximising phenotypic variety as well as the total number of person-years-of-follow-up available in the public realm is vital for ensuring that rare adverse events and contraindications can be anticipated as many of these drugs have been used widely for years there should be substantive information on safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics available in the public domain including public trial registries yet whilst the international committee of medical journal editors icmje policy requires prospective registration of interventional studies on a who primary registry or on clinicaltrialsgov the icmje does not currently require researchers to report summary results on these registries 12  however according to the fda amendment act 2007 the responsible party for applicable clinical trials that are registered on clinicaltrialsgov must report results to a public register within twelve months of the primary completion

can additionally have far-reaching consequences for health and public expenditure as illustrated by the widespread stockpiling and prescription of oseltamivir tamiflu during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 despite a lack of evidence on safety and efficacy 15 clinical trial transparency is therefore vital in order to maximise and unify the sharing of safety information and data on efficacy during this pandemic and beyond public clinical trial registries are an important tool for transparent collaborative research on these registries safety and efficacy data can be uploaded freely shortly after completion of the study and protocol and data collection methods are still quality assessed 16 17  in contrast academic publication may stall for significant periods of time as can be costly and selective with time-intensive writing and review processes furthermore clinical trial registry data is available free of charge and can be pooled without concern for silent outcome switching or publication bias 18 19 20  this is especially important during the covid-19 pandemic as interest in potential treatments for coronavirus generates even greater incentive than normal for the publication of studies with positive results only without rapid sharing of datasets for drugs that may be repurposed for covid-19 secondary analyses of safety data will be arduous and often incomplete 16 21  this may slow down the biomedical innovation process and could lead to preventable side effects occurring in vulnerable patients if safety information remains missing as the pharmaceutical pipeline is accelerated to address the covid-19 pandemic enhancing clinical trial transparency is more important than ever in this study we aimed to determine the scale of unpublished clinical trial results which may hinder safety reviews of repurposed drugs for covid-19 we reviewed the number of completed or terminated trials that have not reported results for an extensive list of medications being repurposed for covid-19 looking at all previous indications for these drugs specifically we searched for any trial results that have not been made available to the public with no results published on either the clinicaltrialgov registry or in the academic literature the 19 drugs assessed were pirfenidone hydroxychloroquine azithromycin favipiravir oseltamivir sarilumab tocilizumab remdesivir leflunomide interferon-alpha lopinavir-ritonavir darunavir-ritonavir baloxivir marboxil umifenovir interferon-beta sofosbuvir nitazoxanide apn01 and ivermectin table 1  these drugs were selected based on information found in potential covid-19 treatment reviews 5 22 23  synonyms and chemical names for these drugs were taken from pubchemncbinlmnihgov appendix 1 24 the us clinical

not found to report results on either clinicaltrialsgov or through academic publication table 2  this shows a large gap in the evidence base for these drugs limiting attempts to comprehensively review their safety before potential global distribution for the covid-19 pandemic the 2238 596 completed studies with available results were comprised of 1172 312 with results on the registry and 1066 284 without results on the registry but with results from a standardised search of the literature table 2  furthermore 2379 634 studies without registry results were outside of the 395 day timeframe for results publication as mandated by the fdaaa 2007 13 although 1008 of these had results published in academic literature 269  not all trials include in this study are applicable under the fdaaa 2007 but this remains a benchmark for good scientific practice 26  with 404 of clinical trial results unavailable for potential covid-19 treatments the data for clinical decision making regarding the safety of these therapeutics are limited if any drug with an incomplete evidence base is used during the pandemic even in compassionate use programmes there is a risk of avoidable harm being done because of missing adverse safety data a knowledge gap was revealed for drugs which have had extensive media coverage such as hydroxychloroquine 370 without results favipiravir 778 and lopinavir 405 28 29 30  these drugs are currently being used in covid-19 patients or trials across the globe sometimes in novel regimens and doses 7 31 32  clinicians have few treatment options available but with greater transparency and proactiveness from clinical trial sponsors regarding the posting of trial results there would be less risk of unforeseen adverse outcomes especially in the treatment of mild-moderate covid-19 as in the pioneer trial 31  public health decision-makers guideline developers clinicians and patients rely on clinical trials systematic reviews and meta-analyses to inform treatment evidence gaps and publication bias therefore influence clinical practice and drug usage worldwide particularly in a treatment landscape as changeable as the covid-19 pandemic if clinical decisions are based on incomplete evidence this can result in avoidable morbidity and mortality if unsafe drugs or ineffective treatments are given on a large scale sponsors and researchers alike also carry an ethical responsibility towards clinical trial participants who consent to participate in research in order to contribute to scientific understanding and improved clinical practice to make results publicly available 33  clinical trial results that are not made available publicly do not fulfil this expectation betraying the trust of participants who may have given up time and health for the benefit of science missing evidence also impacts the direction of future research which is informed by the existing available body of literature our study reveals an important knowledge gap regarding pharmaceuticals potentially being repurposed for covid-19 however the proportion of studies with results available in the academic literature is an approximation and there are several limitations to our study our trial population was limited only to those registered on clinicaltrialsgov while clinicaltrialsgov is the largest registry in the world with over 340000 registrations as of writing additional trials on these therapies may have been registered elsewhere however it is unclear if these would be expected to report at a different rate than those registered to clinicaltrialsgov our strategy for locating publications included only those listed on  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 3 2020  scholar open resources that should cover a majority of published clinical research while including proprietary databases like scopus or ovid may have located some additional publications we do not believe this would have substantially impacted our overall results 34  additionally trials that were not registered at all or published in non-english language journals without inclusion of the nct number would not have been captured by our methodology searcher heterogeneity and difficulty identifying results publication in the academic literature limits accuracy in any manual publication search however our search strategy was standardised and produced a high level of agreement between assessors in a check of a 10 random sample 836 however the discordance present between reviewers only illuminates the inherent difficulties in finding results for the drugs in question especially if the trial id number was not included in line with consort standards 35  our findings add to the existing evidence of the dearth of clinical trial reporting on public registries this analysis investigated clinical trials of drugs currently being considered for use for covid-19 however given the diversity of drug classes included in this report findings are likely to be representative of many pharmaceuticals this presents a major problem for researchers attempting to summarise safety and efficacy by pooling trial data 36  since academic publications often summarise key findings only secondary research efforts are impinged clinicaltrialsgov provides a forum to share complete safety and efficacy data reports as well as facilitating consistent data reporting in a timely manner 16 17  prior research has shown that results reported to clincialtrialsgov were often more complete especially for safety data when compared to matched journal publications 18 19 20  however this depends on researchers registering trials and uploading results in a timely manner within twelve months of the primary completion date the international committee of medical journal editors icmje and the editorial offices of medical journals could play an important role in improving the lack of timely results posting on clinical trial registries by demanding submission of a link to summary results on public registries before academic publication although this may mean that the publication bias of positive publishable results may trickle down to reporting on public registries as well furthermore public funders and institutional publication funds could demand that trial sponsors post their results before allocating funding for academic publication these funding bodies could also deny individual sponsors funding if they have in the past violated clinical trial reporting rules 37  at the very least journals should conform to the consort statement in ensuring that registry ids are clearly indicated in the abstract full-text and meta-data of published clinical trials in order promote easier discoverability and record linkage between registries and publications 35  finally clinical trial sponsors such as universities hospitals public research institutions and pharmaceutical companies should themselves work towards improving their institutional clinical trial reporting performance by making use of available resources that provide detailed step-bystep instructions as to how to go about this task 14  especially during the covid-19 pandemic it is of great importance that trials sponsors release summary results on these registries retrospectively to inform decision making around existing treatments being re-purposed for covid-19 overall our findings reveal a significant evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for covid-19 this uncertainty could cause a large burden of extra morbidity in the global pandemic we  cc-by 40 international

claus jensen erik zbigniew skowron gert mller lykke mark strivens steve gardner  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a novel coronavirus strain disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16 of hospitalized cases the admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of covid-19 include severe hypoxia low platelet count elevated bilirubin hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate these symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases the diseases also share similar comorbidity risks including dementia type 2 diabetes mellitus coronary heart disease hypertension and chronic renal failure sepsis has been observed in up to 59 of hospitalized covid-19 patients it is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapydrug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe covid-19 patients this would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of covid-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease as there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed covid-19 patients correlating their genomic profile disease severity and outcome co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors such as ethnicity blood group smoking bmi etc a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible we therefore ran a study on the uk biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes and correlated these with covid-19 patients sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20 like the initial studies for covid-19 patients standard genome wide association studies gwas have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis we used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from uk biobank we identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction pi3kmtor pathway signaling immune response regulation aberrant gaba and neurogenic signaling this study has identified 70 sepsis related genes many of them for the first time that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe covid-19 patients we have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe covid-19  the 35 million confirmed covid-19 cases worldwide have resulted in 250000 deaths up to 4 may 2020 1  while around 80 of cases will result in mild forms of the disease a study of admissions in 166 uk hospitals showed that around 33 of all patients requiring hospitalization and 45 of those requiring high dependency or intensive care have died from the disease 2  there is a significant correlation with age sex and underlying co-morbidities with elderly males at highest mortality risk there has been some success in repurposing existing antiviral therapies such as the investigational agent remdesivir in covid-19 patients 3  but antiviral agents tend to be more effective when applied early in the disease course it would be highly desirable to understand the differential in host response between patients in terms of their underlying genetic epidemiological and clinical factors to be able to predict which individuals are more at risk of developing severe covid-19 and to identify potential therapies for the later stages of the disease which are driven by the hosts immune response rather than the coronavirus 4  severe disease has been reported in up to 16 of hospitalized cases and often requires forced oxygen therapy andor sedation and ventilation of patients a viral sepsis has been observed in many patients and is thought to be crucial to the disease mechanism of covid-19 5  the admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among sars-cov-2 confirmed cases of covid-19 include severe hypoxia low platelet count elevated bilirubin hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate 6 7  these are symptoms that are also highly correlated with severe sepsis cases the two diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia type 2 diabetes mellitus coronary heart disease hypertension and chronic renal failure 8  sepsis has been observed in up to 59 of hospitalized covid-19 patients 9  sepsis is itself a life-threatening condition with a mortality rate of 20 that can result from a patients dysregulated systemic inflammatory response to a pathogen 10  it is one of the leading causes of mortality in hospitals in the us representing a major socioeconomic burden 11  in sepsis there is an intersection between the inflammatory and hemostatic pathways with the simultaneous activation of both the inflammatory and the coagulation cascades the spectrum of this interaction can vary from mild thrombocytopenia to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation dic 12  perhaps due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease very few gwas have found significant genetic loci relating to sepsis risk 13  of these genes the majority relate to endothelial cell and immune response pathways but there is still very little known about the genetic risk factors underlying susceptibility to developing sepsis while sepsis in itself represents a significant area of unmet medical need the studies cited above provide evidence that many of the patients who developed a severe response to sars-cov-2 also presented with sepsis having identified a significant number of risk-associated genes in a sepsis population we aim to investigate if those risk variants are also present in patients who have been hospitalized with severe covid-19 if so this would provide insights into the shared risk factors and potential novel therapeutic options for both diseases we analyzed a dataset using sepsis patients found in the uk biobank 14  containing sepsis patients n6843 3700 males and 3143 females and age and co-morbidity matched controls n6820 4295 males and 2525 females due to limited data availability it was not possible to fully sex match the controls the available genotype data for the cohorts included 542245 snps after quality control cases were identified using the icd-10 codes relating to hospital admission with sepsis following infection from a number of different pathogenic sources the case criteria included a series of seven septicemia related icd-10 codes see appendix for full details the construction of an appropriate control set is more challenging with an infectious disease as the lack of disease may result from lack of exposure as much as a genetic protective effect or other predisposition to resistance to overcome this we included only patients who had been exposed to some of the most common sepsis-causing pathogens such as staphylococcus and streptococcus species but not gone on to develop sepsis the control group criteria also included at least one of the icd-10 codes for the most common chronic co-morbidities known to increase a patients risk of developing sepsis including patients with diabetes hypertension chronic renal andor liver disease we then ranked the controls who met these criteria by age selecting the oldest first as age is also another critical phenotypic risk factor for sepsis controls were therefore selected for maximum risk and exposure and age matched one limitation of the uk biobank dataset is that the ethnicity distribution of the participants is heavily skewed to white british participants and it has consequently not been possible to fully investigate additional risk factors in bame patients the case and control population co-morbidity profile is shown in figure 1  we used the precisionlife combinatorial multi-omics platform to identify sepsis associated snps and genes from the sepsis casecontrol dataset precisionlife is a multi-omics genomic proteomic transcriptomic phenotypic association platform that enables the hypothesis-free detection of high order disease associated combinations of features eg snp genotypes at genome wide study scale 15  it finds and statistically validates combinations of features typically three to ten features in combination known as signatures that together are strongly associated with a specific disease diagnosis or other clinical phenotype eg fast disease progression or therapy response it can combine genomic transcriptomic and epidemiological data in its analyses when used to analyze genomic data from patients precisionlife can identify high-order epistatic interactions comprising multiple consistently co-associated snp genotypes this analytical mining platform has been validated in multiple disease populations 16 17  the analysis and annotation of the sepsis associated combinatorial genomic signatures in this dataset using the precisionlife platform took less than a day working hypothesis-free running on a dual cpu 4 gpu compute server the sepsis disease signatures identified by the analysis were then annotated and disease-associated snps were mapped to the human reference genome 18 in order to identify disease-associated and clinically relevant target genes a semantic knowledge graph derived from multiple public and private data sources was used to annotate the snps and targets providing sufficient contextual information to test the targets against the 5rs criteria of early drug discovery 19 and forming strong testable hypotheses for their mechanism of action and impact on the sepsis disease phenotype we also applied a series of heuristics to the resulting sepsis risk-associated genes in order to identify novel sepsis targets with high potential either for drug development or drug repurposing these criteria include a strong association of the target with the disease and its pathophysiological mechanisms relevant tissue expression tractability for novel disease targets amongst several others additional criteria used for prioritizing repurposing targets included known drugs patent scope favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles for repurposing targets is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 9 2020  we then sought to correlate these findings with covid-19 from the uk biobank we currently have genotype data for 572 patients who have tested positive for covid-19 in hospital and 97 patients who have tested positive but have not been hospitalized although there is as yet no additional clinical data available on these patients given the way in which uk patients have been admitted and treated we believe that hospitalization for the disease could be used as a surrogate indicator of having a relatively severe form of the disease we compared the significant disease associated combinatorial signatures found in the sepsis cohort against these covid-19 patients in order to investigate if any of them are also present in the covid-19 population conducting a standard plink 20 gwas analysis on the uk biobank sepsis dataset that we generated revealed no significant snps  figure 3  this is not an unexpected result as it replicates the findings of existing sepsis gwas studies which have yielded few results previously 21 22  it is also consistent with the initial findings reported by the covid-19 host genetics initiative 23 based on data from 917 covid-19 cases in contrast with the single snp association basis of plink the precisionlife platform constructs high-order networks of coassociated snps signatures which are associated in combination with the disease phenotype some of the component snps in these signatures will fall below the gwas p-value threshold when evaluated individually across the whole population however in combination the signatures can be proven to be highly significant using multiple discriminative statistical techniques running the same sepsis dataset using the precisionlife platform we identified 1446 combinations of snp genotypes disease signatures representing different combinations of snp genotypes within the sepsis patient population table 1  these signatures consisted mainly of 3 to 5 snp genotypes in combination where most of their constituent snps would not have been discovered using standard gwas analyses  all of the snp genotypes and their combinations were scored using a random forest rf algorithm based on a 5-fold crossvalidation method to evaluate the accuracy with which the snp genotype combinations predict the observed case control split the majority of the critical snps were assigned a high rf score by the algorithm thus confirming that they have a strong association with the disease  figure 4a  the chromosomal distribution of the critical snps is shown in aggregate in figure 4b and in detail in figure 4c   cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 9 2020  mapping the highest-scoring snps to genes revealed 70 genes that are strongly associated with the risk of developing sepsis of these genes several have already been shown to be implicated in sepsis pathogenesis in the scientific literature providing validation for the hypothesis-free combinatorial approach to analyzing complex disease populations in contrast a recent metaanalysis reviewing all previous studies investigating genetic variants and sepsis risk found just 23 genes that were significantly associated with disease susceptibility 24   cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 9 2020  disease architecture of the sepsis cohort generated by the precisionlife platform each circle represents a disease associated snp genotype edges represent co-association in patients and colors represent distinct patient sub-populations or communities functional enrichment analysis of the highest-scoring genes indicated that a significant number of them are involved in processes such as stress response leukocyte and immune system activation cell adhesion and autophagy  figure 6  of the 70 sepsis risk genes we identified 13 of them are targeted by active chemical compounds seven of those genes are targeted by licensed drugs and could therefore represent potential drug repurposing opportunities the specific genes and pathways are described in the appendix and some are outlined further in the discussion section as shown in figure 4b  there is a significant cluster of snps and genes associated with the x chromosome it may be a coincidence that some of the key genes for covid-19 infection eg ace2 and angiotensin ii are located on this chromosome and that by having two copies of the x chromosome women might be offered some level of protection against the effects of the disease there is a small possibility that it may also be related to the lack of complete sex matching of the controls this observation will be the subject of further study is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 9 2020  we focused our current analysis on the autosomal snps and searched for sepsis associated combinatorial signatures in 572 patients who were hospitalized and tested positive for covid-19 51 of the 572 patients have at least one of the significant nstates found in the sepsis population indicating an element of autosomal genetic overlap between patients who are at risking developing sepsis and those who develop severe reactions to sars-cov-2 in total 33 sepsis disease signatures were found in these patients that were not observed in covid positive patients showing mild symptoms or any sepsis controls we have described the likely functional impact of one of these disease signatures in the discussion section many of the risk-associated genes found using the precisionlife platform can be grouped into one of four common biological pathways that can be linked to sepsis pathogenesis immune-related genes cns signaling molecules the pi3kmtor pathway and targets relating to the endothelium out of the 70 significant genes found 21 of them have already been investigated in the context of cancer ranging from in vitro and preclinical studies through to large clinical trials the most common pathway these targets centered around was the pi3kaktmtor pathway which is implicated in driving oncogenesis through its effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis 25  we identified genes that are direct regulators of pi3k phosphoinositide-3-kinase mutations in these classes of genes are associated with immune deficiency syndromes resulting in chronic viremia recurrent respiratory tract infections and defects in b cell development 26 27  pi3k plays a key role in both the adaptive and innate immune response as it plays a critical role in the development of regulatory natural killer nk memory t and b lymphocytes as well as functional phagosome formation 28  it is also crucial for the activation of the il-12 negative feedback pathway that helps to resolve inflammation in this way we can hypothesize that the pi3k pathway is critical for regulating the immune response during the development of sepsis this theory is supported by a study that demonstrated that activation of pi3kakt signaling attenuated pro-inflammatory markers neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis in a model of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction 29  however there is some contradictory evidence surrounding the role of the pi3k pathway in sepsis exemplified by a model of sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction that showed selective inhibition of a pi3k isoform reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines and other pathological markers of sepsis 30  this indicates that pi3k also plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune system in the context of sepsis pathogenesis we found two genes associated with mtor mammalian target of rapamycin signaling the mtor pathway is a critical regulator of t-cell differentiation and function with inhibition of mtor activity resulting in increased autophagy and sustained development of memory cd8 cells and regulatory cd4 cells 31  furthermore a study found that patients with sepsis had higher  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 9 2020  serum levels of key molecules in the mtor signaling pathway 32  indicating that high mtor activity may play a role in driving key disease processes involved in sepsis in addition to this we also identified three genes that indirectly affect the pi3kaktmtor pathway through interaction with pten one the main inhibitors of this pathway 33  our results indicate that whilst these apoptosis-related pathways are most commonly associated with oncogenesis these cellular processes are also highly important in the regulation of the immune system and variants in these genes may also predispose patients to inflammatory diseases such as sepsis as well as cancer as to be expected our analysis found significant genes relating to both the innate and adaptive immune response the identification of over 10 genetic variants in a range of different immunological targets indicates that many patients who develop sepsis may have inherent aberrations in their immune response system when challenged by an infectious agent of these targets one gene encodes a t cell differentiation antigen that binds to key components of gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria causing agglutination and inhibiting their virulence factors infusion of this cd receptor in a mouse model of sepsis resulted in improved survival and reduced systemic inflammation indicating that patients with variants in this gene likely have defective pathogen binding abilities and greater susceptibility to infection by sepsis-causing bacteria we also identified several transcription factors involved in regulation of expression of certain classes of lymphocytes and mhc class ii genes one of these genes encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in regulating interferon-gamma induced genes thereby modulating the duration of the inflammatory response whilst a different gene we found is critical for class switch recombination csr in activated b cells furthermore we found a target encoding a transcription factor that is essential for the development of il-17 producing t cells high il-17 is associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype and increased risk of death in a mouse model administered with toxic shock syndrome toxin tss-1 34  in addition to this we identified a gene encoding a serine protease that inhibits the function of furin an enzyme that cleaves a variety of different pathogenic substrates including sars-cov-2 coronavirus 35  furin is upregulated during the adaptive immune response enhancing the virulence of pathogens through the cleavage of key sites and allowing viral entry into the host cells 36  administration of a furin inhibitor in a mouse model of atherosclerosis attenuated vascular endothelial injury and proinflammatory cytokine expression indicating that this could be a key target in several different facets of sepsis pathophysiology 37  endothelial dysfunction is a well-established mechanism that contributes to sepsis pathogenesis 38  a recent gwas identified two genes fer and man2a1 that are implicated in the endothelial response to pathogens our study identified four more targets that are associated with the vascular endothelium two of these genes encode cell adhesion and ecm-interacting molecules that have been linked to endothelial inflammation and oxidative stress in models of atherosclerosis one of these genes is inhibited by oxidized ldls via the lox-1 receptor resulting in increased vascular inflammation and lipid accumulation there is evidence that oxidized ldls are upregulated in inflammatory conditions and inhibition of lox-1 may help to attenuate the pro-inflammatory cascades seen in sepsis 39  a different risk-associated gene is regulated by angiotensin ii and has been implicated in the promotion of smooth muscle fibrosis oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in this way furthermore we have found a transcription factor that targets vegf a key regulator of angiogenesis and endothelial cell function high levels of vegf are observed in animal models of sepsis where it potentiates the effects of tnf- on endothelial cells and increases vascular permeability which is a key pathogenic event in severe sepsis 40  finally we identified several variants in genes associated with neurogenic signaling pathways the cns plays a key role in regulating the immune system and cytokine expression as well as the systemic vascular response observed in sepsis patients 41  one of these variants encoded a key enzyme involved in the production of gaba the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cns polymorphisms in this gene are associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia epilepsy bipolar depression and anxiety to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence currently linking gabaergic signaling to sepsis however studies have found increased levels of one of the targets that we identified in models of hippocampal inflammation and autoimmune conditions another target identified in our study encodes a g-protein-coupled receptor that regulates gabab  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder

signaling increase the risk of developing sepsis alongside the gaba related targets this study identified we also found targets in a number of other common neurotransmission pathways including regulation activation of kainate-type glutamate receptors and the adenosine receptor as well as four other genes that are key to neuronal development and synaptic plasticity one of the variants we found that was implicated in neurogenic signaling is located in adora1 which encodes for the adenosine a1 receptor high levels of adenosine have already been found in the plasma of patients with septic shock and severe sepsis indicating that it may play a key role in the development of the disease 42  furthermore increased activation of adenosine a1 receptors in the lung results in increased gram-negative-induced tissue injury through increased pro-inflammatory mediators 43  a study has now shown that using adenosine a1 antagonists attenuates sepsis pathophysiology and improves survival in a rat model of the disease 44  it is well-known that different diseases may share common pathways and drugs that affect genes in these pathways may therefore be able to treat a variety of disease indications the uniquely detailed disease architecture views generated by the combinatorial approach used in this study allow for the systematic repurposing of all known drugs against all the disease relevant targets identified mapping existing drugs onto the genetic and metabolic signatures identified for patient sub-groups indicates areas where there are already good clinical options and also where trial use of existing therapeutics with good safety and tolerability profiles with acceptable routes of administration could have potential for a given patient their specific combination of snps will in large part determine which drug or combination of drugs are likely to benefit them personally we used the precisionlife platform to identify drug repurposing candidates for key disease-associated targets by mapping all of the existing drug options onto the genes found in different subgroups of the patient population applying a series of heuristics that we have developed we can rapidly identify candidates that may be therapeutically beneficial for select subsets of the patient population and to identify and efficiently prioritize those with the greatest repurposing potential for further investigation of the 70 sepsis risk genes we identified 13 of them are targeted by active chemical compounds found in drugbank 45 or chembl 46 and could therefore represent potential drug repurposing opportunities in total there are 59 known active drugs identified for the 13 targets which could form the basis for a repurposing screen the graph in figure 8 shows the drugs and other research compounds known to be active at the adenosine a1 receptor adora1 one of the targets described above the remaining drug repurposing candidates identified in the study are

number that are specific to sepsis but the majority 43 of 71 -61 are shared both in sepsis and severe covid-19 patients we found 33 sepsis disease signatures composed of autosomal snps that were present in patients who tested positive for covid-19 and showed severe symptoms but were not observed in any covid-19 positive patients showing mild symptoms or any sepsis controls one of the snp genotypes combinations signatures found in both sepsis and severe covid-19 patients but not in sepsis controls or patients with mild non-hospitalized covid-19 disease contained three snps that mapped to six genes  table 2  two of the snps have been previously linked to cardiovascular and hypertension in phenotype-wide association studies phewas studies 47 48 and functional annotations of the genes revealed that several of them are involved in neutrophil degranulation leukocyte activation and immune effector processes this disease signature was also observed in only 1137 of the other 480000 uk biobank participants who are likely to suffer from complications in their immune responses because of this we will continue investigating the likely functional impacts of all the sepsis disease

may 9 2020  using only genetic data from the uk biobank we have identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes that would not have been found using conventional gwas approaches using the same dataset we have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that have the potential to be directly effective in improving survival rates in sepsis we found several other genes with strong mechanism of action hypotheses connected to existing drug targets that may form the basis of more novel drug discovery strategies we will be using these new insights into the disease to investigate several novel therapeutic strategies that may help to reduce the high mortality rates currently observed in patients who develop sepsis both within and without the context of covid-19 we continue to investigate the overlap between these sepsis-associated genetic signatures and those seen in covid19-positive patients who present with life-threatening symptoms including the development of viral sepsis as more data from covid-19 patients becomes available this may help to gain greater understanding into the mechanisms of late-stage disease and apparent clinical differences in patient responses to the sars-cov-2 virus new datasets may help elucidate links to observed epidemiological risk factors such as ethnicity blood group and smoking as these data become available for direct study they may also provide new directions to search for effective therapies for patients outside of the antiviral space based on a better understanding of the host responses  cc-by-nc 40

delta-coronavirus    and  of subfamily orthocoronavirinae however the members of beta-coronavirus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov1 and sars-cov2 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have been involved in pneumonia epidemics in the 21st century sars-cov1 mers-cov and sars-cov2 outbreaks caused by zoonotic viruses lau et al 2005 reusken et

phenomenal spread of sars-cov-2 to every nook and cranny of the world 366 million infections and 309774 deaths compelled world health organization who to declare it pandemic on march 20 2020 the virus causing covid-19 was named 2019-ncov 2019 novel coronavirus on january 12 2020 by who chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 however the international virus classification commission ictv on february 11 2020 named this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this threat of global concern to humanity mainly due to the unavailability of proper treatment huang et al 2020 pushed the investigators to discover and design therapeutic drugs and vaccines to combat the coronavirus infection symptoms include fever dyspnea shortness of breath and cough whereas severe cases lead to kidney failure and death rothan  byrareddy 2020 the sars-cov-2 is composed of spike s protein membrane m protein envelope e protein and nucleocapsid n protein in anti covs therapies the main focus is to boost the human immune system or to block the binding of spike protein with the receptor proteins therefore the treatments based on targeting coronavirus rely on blocking of virus binding to receptors inhibition of virus replication prevention of the synthesis of viral rna and inhibition of the virus self-assembly process bosch et al 2003 khan et al 2018 omrani et al 2014 to combat the latest covs threats the researchers are following multiple approaches for novel drug development zumla et al 2016 and testing the efficacy of existing drugs in one approach experiments were performed to test the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs ribavirin interferons and cyclophilin inhibitors against sars-cov-2 chan et al 2013 zumla et al 2016 the use of these antiviral drugs is approved against viral infections and their dosages efficacy metabolic characteristic and side effects are well known however there is a possibility that this broad-spectrum treatment against covs would not be effective in the second approach molecular databases were subjected to high-throughput screening for potential drug molecules to combat infection caused by a coronavirus de wilde et al 2014 dyall et al 2014 this strategy was proved successful in the discovery of lopinavirritonavir for the treatment of hiv some researchers are using the genomic and pathological information of covs for the development of a new specific drug from scratch theoretically this is an effective approach however it is very time consuming and might cost several years or even more than ten years khan et al 2018 omrani et al 2014 structural bioinformatics based approaches are the fastest way for finding the potential molecules from the marketed drugs or bioactive compounds for effective treatment of sars-cov-2 main-protease or 3clpro inhibition is a promising target to control the recent sars-cov-2 infection due to its essential role in viral maturation and replication ul qamar et al 2020 3clpro has three important domains i-iii which correspond to positions 8101 102184 and 201303 respectively there is a connecting loop that corresponds to position 185200 which connects domains ii and iii the structure of 3clpro has an important catalytic dyad consist of his41 and cys145 in this study the protein of sars-cov-2 3clpro also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease was subjected to drug repurposing and virtual screening for potent drug identification followed by molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation our findings revealed that saquinavir which is an hiv protease inhibitor reported experimentally kim et al 1998 and tcm5280805 are promising hits which need in vitro validation for antiviral effects we hope this study will provide useful information for the

hernandez et al 2017 literature mining was carried out to collect anti-hiv drugs for screening against 3clpro sars-cov-2 multiple drugs were retrieved from drugbank database a total of 31 drugs were

generated by schrdinger maestro three steps of virtual screening htvs sp and xp were used to screen the anti-hiv and tcm compounds databases furthermore the bioactivity of these compounds was predicted by using molinspiration cheminformatics tool molinspiration is an efficient tool that has been used by several studies 4500 to predict bioactivity results top hits from anti-hiv drugs and

wang et al 2019 the crystallographic structure 306 amino acids long of the 3clpro sars-cov-2 was retrieved from the rcsb database using accession id 6lu7 the structure of 3clpro was analyzed for missing residues and refinement the structure was subjected to energy minimization and structure preparation using maestro the structure of 3clpro has three domains as given in figure 1a these domains i-iii correspond to position 8101 102184 and 201303 respectively while there is a connecting loop corresponds to position 185200 which connects domains ii and iii all these domains are coloured differently the ligand in the active site yellow colour sphere has also been shown in figure 1a the electrostatic potential of the 3clpro shows that the active site region possesses a strong electronegative potential while weak electronegative potential around the active site can also be observed however the weak electropositive and neutral potential is distributed too the active site grid x 1071 y  1241 z  6883 was generated and important residues were identified important active site residues his41 met49 tyr54 phe140 leu141 asn142 cys145 his163 met165 glu166 leu167 phe185 asn187 and gln192 were identified and shown in figure 1b the binding cleft is at the same place as in the previously reported sars with the two critical residues his41 and cys145 forms a catalytic dyad in the current study the repurposing of anti-hiv drugs against the sars-cov-2 main protease was carried out using structure-based screening methods anti-hiv drugs such as lopinavirritonavir are reported to be active against the sars-cov-2 clinical trials of these drugs on different groups of patients showed significant improvement thus anti-hiv drugs possess the potential to work against srs-cov-2 targets therefore immediate testing of anti-hiv drugs may lead to a discovery of potent inhibitor against the sars-cov-2 a list of 31 anti-hiv drugs table 1 was downloaded from drugbank database httpswwwdrugbankca using their respective accession ids wishart et al 2018 these drugs were prepared for molecular docking against the proteinase enzymes of coronavirus sars-cov-2 the docking scores were ranged from 909 kcalmol to 416 kcalmol all the conformations were analyzed for the best interactions with the key residues initial criteria were set to shortlist the drugs based on binding affinity and interactions with the dyad residues his41 and cys145 the docking score 909 kcalmol was reported for the hiv protease inhibitor drug saquinavir figure 2 this drug has been reported to inhibit the hiv proteinase enzymes too in this case sars-cov-2 the saquinavir formed six hydrogen bonds including two with the central dyad residues his41 and cya145 previous reports on different sars such as the octa-peptide also stressed the blocking of these two residues other interactions include four hydrogen bonds with glu166 gln189 met49 and gly143 while some pi-alkyl interactions including one with cys145 and other residues are also formed thus we speculate that the clinical testing of saquinavir should be done at the earliest it is also reported by different scientists that hiv drugs could be potentially used against the recent coronavirus furthermore we also performed virtual screening of the traditional chinese medicines database tcm a total of 37800 compounds were screened after excluding the drugs violating the lipinski rules of five important residues in the active site his41 and cys145 were targeted the top five compounds based on the docking scores were selected the best docking score 11183 kcalmol was reported for the compound 5280805 more than ten bonds including hydrogen bonds van der waals electrostatics and pi-alkyl interactions were formed among the seven hydrogen bonds two hydrogen bonds with the residue his41 were also formed which is a key residue in the active site dyad among the other phe140 leu141 asn142 his164 glu166 and thr190 also formed hydrogen bonds with the ligand 5280805 on the other hand compound 5280863 with the docking score 7688 kcalmol formed a strong hydrogen bond with the key residue his41 the compound 5280863 also formed five hydrogen bonds with the other active site residues glu166 arg188 gln189 and thr190 the other three compounds 5280445 5280343 and 5458190 were also analyzed for the interaction with the key residues it can be seen from figure 3 that his41 is mainly involved in the interaction with the ligands table 2 is showing the 2d structures of the top five compounds with their docking scores cross validation of our predicted compounds by comparing with the experimentally tested compounds showed that the saquinavir and tcm5280805 possess a similar scaffold with myricetrin and scutellarin which are flavonoids and reported to have strong inhibitory effects by targeting 3clpro on the other hand the four compounds tcm5280343 tcm5280445 tcm5280863 and tcm5458190 from tcm database shares structural similarity with scutellarein dihydromyricetin quercetagetin myricetin 56-dihydroxyflavone 67-dihydroxyflavone chrysin herbacetin and baicalein which are flavonoids and testes to have strong inhibitory effects in an experimental condition by targeting 3clpro chen  du 2020 dai et al 2020 yang et al 2020 their structural analyses showed that these compounds mainly form bonds with phe140 and glu166 while our compounds specifically target the catalytic dyad with supplementary interactions with the other active site residues thus we speculate that our compounds could also show the same potential activity against the 3clpro in the experimental assay because our compounds are also plants derived extracts and belongs to a group of flavonoids furthermore results obtained from the server shows that all these shortlisted compounds are active against the protease target from the scores it can be seen that saquinavir with score 040 possesses strong inhibitory effects against the proteases while the others the reported score for tcm5280805 07 tcm5280863 027 tcm5280445 022 tcm5280343 025 while tcm5458190 possess 012 bioactivity score against the protease target thus these results strongly suggest that the shortlisted compounds could efficiently inhibit the 3clpro in the experimental setup and could be tested for clinical trials to understand the conformational and dynamics features of the selected hits against the 3clpro of sars-cov-2molecular dynamics md simulation is an imperative method to explore the behavior of each system in real-time dynamics features of the six selected systems saquinavir 528085 5280863 5280445 5280343 and 5458190 were calculated after 100 ns simulation for stability rmsd while to evaluate the flexibility at residue level rmsf of the complexes were calculated to comprehend the overall stability and flexibility of the system the stability of all the six systems was calculated by using root mean square deviation rmsd we tested the stability of the docked drugs in the active pocket and its effects on the stability of the whole system the results suggest that all the six systems were stable with acceptable deviation as shown in figure 4 the average rmsd for all the systems was found to be between 1 and 4 saquinavir-3clpro exhibited an average rmsd of 25  soon after reaching 35 ns the system attained stability remains uniform for the rest of the time it can be seen that the complex 3clpro-5280805 remained stable but after 60 ns the system showed an acceptable deviation for a little time after that the system gained stability and entered the production stage for a complex 3clpro-5280445 the system showed a slight deviation between 40 and 45ns but remained stable during the course of the simulation on the other hand 3clpro-5280343 and 3clpro-5280863 reported divergence between 40 and 60ns but the system soon gained stability similarly in the case of 3clpro-5458190 the examination of rmsd of the c backbone has an average rmsd of 23  the system shows a deviation in the rmsd for the first 15 ns while remained uniformed for the rest of the simulation time thus these results revealed the stable internal motions and negligible fluctuations during the course of the simulation the differences in the rmsd of each system is due to the binding and unbinding of the ligand at different time intervals also the systems with more stable behaviour show that the ligand remained intact and the system entered the production phase soon when compared to the others aside the binding of small molecules affects the system differently as the ligand-binding orientation changes over the simulation time the rmsf depicts the flexibility at residues level as shown in figure 5 the pattern of flexibility is almost similar and was recorded around 14 in all secondary components except loop regions with slightly fluctuated residues however active site residues seem stable in the course of the simulation which is due to the ligand recognition by the ligand-binding regions it can be seen that 3clpro-squanavir and 3clpro-5458190 showed an average rmsf of 25  with significant fluctuations in the regions 4045 90110 150165 and 245260 a similar pattern of fluctuation was also observed for systems including 3clpro-5280805 3clpro-5280445 and 3clpro-5280863 however the average rmsf remained below the 2  only the system 3clpro-5280343 wed higher fluctuation than the rest but the residual flexibility pattern was similar the average rmsf for all the five systems was around 14 as clearly seen in figure 5 left panel these findings here show that the target protein is stabilized by binding of all five chosen drugs docked against it thus the binding of ligand has significantly affected the residue fluctuation which is due to the internal residues disturbed by the binding of different ligands and this both correlated and non-correlated motions are affected the secondary structure components are also given in figure 5 right panel the radius of gyration rog conveys the information of stable and unstable folding protein while interacting with ligands less compactness more unfolded shows higher rog values whereas low rog values indicate strong compactness and higher structural stiffness more folded thus rog was determined to assess the systems compactness over time as shown in figure 6 the simulated complexes show gyration scores between 21 and 24 in the case of 3clpro-squanavir the gyration score for the initial 2000 frames was reported to be 2250  however a little fluctuation between 20003000 frames was observed but soon after 3500 the values become lower and uniform in the case of 3clpro-5280805 3clpro-5280445 3clpro-5280863 and 3clpro-5458190 showed an average gyration of 222250  similarly 3clpro-5280445 also showed similar fluctuation but in the last few frames the values fluctuated a little higher which is assumed to be in an acceptable range the binding and unbinding of ligands greatly affected the overall compactness of the complexes as given in figure 7 in 3clpro-squanavir 3clpro-5280805 and 3clpro-5280343 complexes the hydrogen bond with his41 was reported in 87 65 and 39 of the trajectories hydrogen bond with cys145 residue was reported in 65 trajectories only in the 3clpro-squanavircomplex furthermore leu141 and glu166 were found in almost all complexes however another important residue gln189 was found in 76 of the 3clpro-squanavir trajectories 36 in 3clpro-5280805 while 21 in 3clpro-tcm5280445 trajectories other active site residues were not detected in a significant population of the md trajectories mmgbsa a popular approach was used to estimate the binding free energy of all the six systems the binding free energy determines the binding affinity between ligands and 3clpro each energy term including van der waals energy electrostatic energy polar solvation energy solvent accessible surface area energy and total binding free energy of all the systems are given in table 3 it can be seen that the 3clpro-saquinavir system possesses the highest total binding energy of 744061 kcalmol thus it confirms that saquinavir an anti-hiv drug that has been reported to inhibit hiv protease experimentally possesses strong inhibitory effects against the 3clpro of sars-cov-2 recently published results also shortlisted saquinavir as a potential candidate but they only performed 20 ns simulation khan et al 2020 which could not reflect better results than what we revealed by adding 5-folds more simulation time furthermore the top five hits from tcm virtual screening results were also subjected to the free binding energy as reported by the virtual screening results tcm5280805 was reported with the best docking score and interaction herein tcm5280805 also possesses the best total binding energy29486 kcalmol against the 3clpro also the other hits from including tcm5280445 tcm5280343 tcm5280863 and tcm5458190 possess total binding energy of 16342 kcalmol 17184 kcalmol 10315 kcalmol and 15695 kcalmol while the other energy terms such as van der waals energy electrostatic energy polar solvation energy solventaccessible surface area are given in table 3 thus these results strongly suggest that saquinavir and tcm5280805 should be tested experimentally against the sars-cov-2 at earliest to date a total of 4434653 confirmed cases and 302169 deaths are reported from the sars-cov-2 epidemic which indicates that the current viral treatment is not satisfactory and more diverse studies are needed for the incorporation of various natural and fda approved compounds for the effective treatment of sars-cov-2 further our existing capacity for treating zoonotic coronavirus infections is still in the trial and the available resources seem very limited to fight this life-threatening hazard although extensive research efforts have been initiated during 2003 and 2012 outbreaks of sars and mers-cov respectively however no effective drugs so far have been synthesized nor the matter may be taken seriously to prevent the future pandemics of zoonotic coronavirus drug repositioning is a universal strategy for neglected diseases due to reduced number of clinical trial steps required could reduce the time and cost of the medicine to reach the market existing pharmaceutical supply chains could facilitate the formulation and distribution of the drug the known possibility of combining with other drugs could enable more efficient treatment repositioning could encourage the development of new modes of action for old drugs and new types of medicines eliminating activation obstacles from early stages of study could allow the project to progress rapidly towards disease-oriented development pushpakom et al 2019 one of the primary reasons why no prototype coronavirus inhibitor has progressed to the early preclinical stage so far is due to the transient nature of this epidemic like the sars virus 17 years ago the new sars-cov-2 and the new evolving coronaviruses that may continue to pose a threat to global public health in the future hence discovering broad-spectrum inhibitors that can reduce the symptoms of human coronavirus infection remains a formidable subject of study considering the time-consuming process of designing and documenting antiviral medications proven therapies for certain diseases may be the only fastest therapeutic choice for emerging infectious diseases the prescription has ample experience and dosage for most of those medications that have been formulated and their health and adme properties are well known in this study based on the results of bioinformatics analysis we targeted 3clpro from sars-cov-2 using drugs repurposing anti-hiv drugs virtual drugs screening tcm approaches to shortlist the most potent compounds for the possible treatment the results of the entire article stressed the potential inhibitory role of saquinavir and tcm5280805 which are based on computer-based virtual drug screening we have not conducted further in vivo and in vitro antiviral experiments yet because we want to share our results with scientists in anti-sars-cov-2 research as soon as possible this study will help to repurpose drug design perform in vivo and in vitro evaluations for candidate drugs obtained in this study and prepare for clinical trial applications 3c-like protease 3clpro also called the main protease is an attractive target for the treatment of sars-cov-2 because of its role in the viral replication cycle the current study focused on structure based approaches repurposed anti-hiv drugs and screened traditional chinese medicines databases against the active site residues of 3clpro initial analysis such as molecular docking scores and interactions with important residues shortlisted one drug saquinavir from anti-hiv drugs while five compounds from tcm databasethese compounds were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis among the six complexes subjected to molecular dynamics simulation saquinavir tcm5280805 showed the highest hydrogen bond occupancy the rest were also found to have good activity against the 3clpro in addition the bioactivity of these compounds were predicted which reported saquinavir as strong potential inhibitor followed by the othersbinding free energy calculations of all the complexes suggested that these compounds significantly interacting and binds with the receptor thus here from all the analyses we suggest that saquinavir and tcm5280805 should be tested experimentally for possible treatment of sars-cov-2 ak zb mk and ssa conceptualized the study and did the analysis aa ms ss wrote the manuscript ak ss and ssa revised the manuscript and

hubei province of china by the chinese centre for disease control cdc china the causative virus was shortly identified as a novel beta-coronavirus dubbed sars-cov-2 the virus belongs to the order nidovirales of the coronaviridae family comprising of the alpha- and beta-coronaviruses these are enveloped positive-sense rna viruses with comparatively large genomes among known rna viruses 264317 kb zheng 2020 su et al 2016 six members of the family are previously known to infect humans including sars-cov and mers-cov which are known to cause severe respiratory ailments in the host paules et al 2020 corman et al 2018 sars-cov-2 is the latest addition to the group and has presented itself as a potent human respiratory pathogen due to a mutation in the receptor binding domain rbd of its spike protein that enables high affinity binding to the ace2 receptor in humans and a polybasic furin cleavage site at the junction of the s1 and s2 subunits of the spike protein andersen et al 2020 hasan et al 2020 since the first report on the virus it has spread across continents inflicting a global health-care and economic emergency in view of the global spread of the outbreak the world health organization who declared it as a pandemic in january 2020 as of 28th may 2020 the number of infections reported was 5596550 and the number of deaths is 353373 the numbers are increasing relentlessly despite concerted efforts to contain the spread of the virus using rigorous diagnostic testing isolation of positive cases and tracing of contacts the scenario is further made grim by the fact that there are no specific drugs or vaccines against the virus currently the current treatments focus on symptom management and supportive therapy prajapat et al 2020 government agencies pharmaceutical companies and research institutes across the globe have taken up the formidable challenge of inventing a specific viable and validated therapeutic agent against sars-cov-2 as it is probably the only solution to the ongoing crisis drug repurposing refers to the identification of novel applicationstargets for an approved or investigational drug outside the premise of its medical indication ashburn  thor 2004 at present the strategy would be a logical choice for developing a therapy for covid-19 considering the substantial time-scales and attrition rates associated with new drug discovery and the trial-based validation of its safety and efficacy the major advantage lies in the fact that a repurposed drug has been already evaluated for its safety by pre-clinical and clinical trials which would save significant amounts of time and money pushpakom et al 2019 a priority concern in sars-cov-2 drug discovery indeed most of the drugs that are currently under investigation for efficacy against sars-cov-2 are repurposed known medicines drugs that are either under development or prescribed off-label against covid-19 include ribavirin interferon- mycophenolic acid ritonavir lopinavir oseltamivir and remdesivir mitj  clotet 2020 baden  rubin 2020 cao et al 2020 muralidharan et al 2020 hendaus 2020 arya  dwivedi 2020 among these hydroxychloroquine an approved anti-malarial drug and two known antivirals ritonavir and remdesivir have been reported to be effective against sars-cov-2 in vitro yan 2020 however more recent studies have reported harmful effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibition of autophagy by these drugs may induce tissue damage and worsen organ injury in covid-19 patients edelstein et al 2020 a number of computational studies that aim to repurpose drugs against covid-19 have been reported the drug targets selected in these studies include the host cell protease tmprss2 elmezayen et al 2020 the spike s protein oliveira et al 2020 sinha et al 2020 the envelope e protein ion channel gupta et al 2020 a putative immune evasion molecule 2-o-ribosemethyltransferase khan et al 2020 the nucleocapsid protein salma et al 2020 and the rna dependant rna polymerase rdrp enzyme elfiky  azzam 2020 elfiky 2020 the aim of the present study is to identify clinically approved drugs that can be targeted to the main protease mpro which is also called 3clpro the enzyme has similar structural fold and cleavage site specificity as that of the picornavirus 3 c protease huang et al 2004 the mpro is an attractive and well characterized drug target in corona viruses owing to the pivotal role it plays in the propagation of the virus inside the host zhang et al 2020 boopathi et al 2020 the non-structural proteins of the virus n  16 is encoded in the orf1ab of the rna genome and gets transcribed and translated into two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab proteolytic cleavage of the pps into its components is required to derive functionally active proteins after its auto-cleavage from pp1a and pp1ab mpro cleaves pp1ab at about 11 sites pp1ab contains the subunits of the replicase complex including the rna dependant rna polymerase rdrp and hence the cleavage becomes an essential requirement for viral replication zhang et al 2020 mousavizadeh  ghasemi 2020 thus the inhibition of mpro would effectively stop viral spread by preventing its replication since human proteases with the same cleavage specificity as the sars-cov-2 protease leu-glnseralagly are not known it is unlikely that an inhibitor would cross react with a human protease zhang et al 2020 very recently jin and co-workers reported the structure of the sars-cov-2 mpro in complex with a potent inhibitor jin et al 2020 the protein is 306 residues long and has a molecular weight 338 kda being a pivotal drug target in sars-cov-2 various groups have reported in silico drug repurposing studies using different approaches against mpro with a wide range of druggable molecules khan et al 2020 aanouz al 2020 pant et al 2020 joshi et al 2020 enmozhi et al 2020 choudhury 2020 kumar et al 2020 umesh et al 2020 das et al 2020 al-khafaji et al 2020 gyebi et al 2020 in the present study in-order to identify clinically approved drugs that would bind to the catalytic site of mpro an e-pharmacophore model based virtual screening was performed on a chemical library of known drugs from the superdrug2 database the database contains more than 4600 active pharmaceuticals which are marketed or approved siramshetty et al 2018 a subset of the drugs selected based on pharmacophore screening was further screened using molecular docking the binding energies of the identified poses were calculated using mm-gbsa method molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on selected poses to understand the dynamic behaviour of the complexes and the stability of the protein-ligand binding the crystal structure of mpro of sars-cov-2 bound to a non-covalent inhibitor x77 at a resolution of 21  was used to generate an energy-optimised pharmacophore hypothesis e-pharmacophore the structural coordinates of mpro-x77 complex was downloaded from the pdb id 6w63 the structure of the protein-ligand complex was pre-processed and water molecules within 5  distance from the ligand were removed missing hydrogens and loops were added and the structure was subjected to restrained energy minimization adopting opls3 force field harder et al 2016 these steps were performed using the protein preparation wizard of the schrodinger suite sastry et al 2013 the e-pharmacophore model was developed using the develop pharmacophore from protein-ligand complex option in the phase module dixon et al 2006 for this the prepared protein-ligand complex was imported to the workspace and default pharmacophore features such as hydrogen bond acceptor a hydrogen bond donor d aromatic ring r and hydrophobicity h were mapped e-pharmacophore based virtual screening was performed using the chemical structures of 4600 drugs ligands from the superdrug2 database prior to the screening the ligands were structurally optimised at near neutral ph 7  1 all plausible tautomers and stereoisomers were generated and protonation states were assigned the ligands were subjected to energy minimisation with opls3 force field using the ligprep module of maestro 114 in order to generate a subset of drugs with the desired molecular features for optimal binding to mpro as mapped by the e-pharmacophore model a pharmacophore based virtual screening was carried out using the phase module of schrodinger suite the fitness scores were used to select the best hits the docking procedure was validated by a control study for this the bound ligand in the crystal structure was re-docked to the pre-processed and prepared protein keeping the same grid box the glide score for this docking was used as a standard value against which the scores for the drugs were compared the control docking was performed in the xp mode the theoretical binding free energies of the potent inhibitors of mpro were calculated using the prime module of maestro 114 lyne et al 2006 mm-gbsa is a popular method to calculate binding energy which uses energy properties of free ligand free receptor and receptorligand complex for binding affinity calculation binding energies were estimated for the 40 drugs selected based on the glide scores of xp docking using the mm-gbsa method the stability of binding of the selected drugs with mpro in an explicit solvent system was determined by molecular dynamics md using desmond module of schrodinger bowers et al 2006 the docked poses of protein ligand complexes were used as input structures and each complex was prepared by system setup option in desmond module in the first step the complexes were solvated with tip3p water model and the solvated system was neutralized by adding nacl- ions after the system generation minimization and relaxation of the protein-ligand complexes under npt were carried out using default protocol of desmond module md simulations were conducted with the periodic boundary conditions in the npt ensemble using opls3 force field the temperature and pressure were kept at 300 k and 1 atmosphere respectively using nose-hoover temperature coupling and isotropic scaling the operation was followed by 100 ns npt production run the binding energy of each complex was determined after the run from selected md trajectory frames by using mm-gbsa method pharmacophore is defined as an ensemble of steric and electronic features that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biological target and to trigger or block its biological response proekt  hemmings 2019 pharmacophore model based screening has evolved as a key tool in computer aided drug discovery because of its ability to screen large libraries for potent hits within a short period of time and minimal computational capacities energy optimised pharmacophore models tries to combine the stereo-electronic features of the ligand with the energetics of its interactions with the protein structure muthusamy et al 2013 in the present study an e-pharmacophore hypothesis was generated to screen for the inhibitors of mpro protein of sars-cov-2 using its crystal structure in complex with a strong broad spectrum non-covalent inhibitor the bound inhibitor an imidazole carbaximide derivative dubbed x77 interacts strongly with the active site amino acid residues based on the ligand-protein complex an energy optimised five-featured pharmacophore hypothesis aarrr was obtained the generated e-pharmacophore model contains two hydrogen bond accepters a and three aromatic rings r figure 1 figure 2 shows the planar representation of the pharmacophore hypothesis with distances between the features the hypothesis aarrr was used as a 3 d search query to screen 4600 drugs from the superdrug2 database to identify drugs with comparable pharmacophore features during the screening the phase module analyses the fitness of compounds with the query hypothesis and ranks the compounds on the basis of fitness scores one thousand compounds were selected in this way and used for the molecular docking based screening the best hits obtained in the e-pharmacophore based screening n  1000 were further screened using molecular docking the docking study analyses the molecular interactions of the different plausible geometries of the drugs poses with the surrounding active site residues of the sars-cov-2 mpro and ranks them on the basis of binding scores the docking processes were carried out using three different approaches htvs sp and xp methods by filtering the outputs after each stage based on glide scores the docking studies also revealed the atomic level interactions between the drugs and the protease re-docking the crystallographic ligand x77 n-4-tert-butylphenyl-n-1r-2-cyclohexylamino-2-oxo-1-pyridin-3-ylethyl-1h imidazole-4-carboxamide to the active site of the protease using the same protocol resulted in the binding of the ligand in the same position and orientation figure 3 and this verified that the docking parameters chosen were optimal analysis of the crystal structure of mpro-x77 complex showed that the binding of the ligand were stabilized through three hydrogen bonds with the active site residues viz gly 143 his 163 and glu 166 the in silico docked structure also exhibited these three hydrogen bonds figure 4 based on htvs and sp docking 40 drugs were selected for xp docking the g-score calculated for the crystallographic ligand x77 was -8243 kcalmol seventeen of the 40 drugs used for xp docking showed g-scores comparable to that of the standard inhibitor used in the study g-scores better than -70 kcalmol supplementary data s1 three highest scoring drugs viz hidrosmin -12689 kcalmol diosmin -11409 kcalmol and monoxerutin -10745 kcalmol are flavanoids with similar pharmacological properties they are used as vaso-protectives and capillary stabilising agents remikirin -9429 kcalmol is an interesting hit because it is a well-known inhibitor of renin an aspartyl endoprotease which acts as the primary enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system himmelmann et al 1996 doxorubisin -916 kcalmol an anthracyne class antineoplastic used as an anti-cancer drug and fluvastatin -8346 kcalmol an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme a hmg-coa reductase used as an antilipemic agent also showed high binding score to the protease of note doxorubisin and its derivatives had been previously shown to be effective in vitro against viruses like hiv hsv dengue virus yellow fever virus rauscher leukemia virus and avian myeloblastosis virus kaptein et al 2010 ash  diekema 1987 jeyaseelan et al 1996 papas  schafer 1977 although the drug targets in each case vary the drugs were able to reduce virus replication in vitro statins in general are known to inhibit the replication of many enveloped viruses by the inhibition of cholesterolisoprenoid pathway shrivastava-ranjan et al 2018 fluvastatin was earlier shown to have an inhibitory effect on heamophilus influenza replication in vitro peng et al 2014 thus the present study identifies the mpro of sars-cov-2 as a novel targets for the known antivirals doxorubisin and fluvastatin fluvastatin is an interesting hit considering the fact that the sars-cov-2 is also an enveloped virus the drug might have a cumulative inhibitory effect on the propagation of the virus if it can inhibit both the mpro and the cholesterol synthesis pathway drugs which showed high glide score was further subjected to binding energy calculation using the mm-gbsa method the binding energy of crystallographic ligand x77 as determined by mmgbsa was -7368 kcalmol six drugs with binding free energies better than -60 kcalmol were selected from the pool of 40 drugs using molecular docking these drugs were binifibrate macimorelin acetate bamifylline rilmazafon afatinib and ezetimibe except bamyfilline g-score 661 kcalmol all these drugs had shown g-scores better than -7 kcalmol in the docking studies however few drugs that showed glide scores comparable to the standard inhibitor showed lower binding energies binifirbate a hypolipidaemic drug showed a very high binding energy -6904 kcalmol similar to that of the standard inhibitor x77 binifibrate forms hydrogen bonds with three active site residues viz gly 143 his 163 and glu 166 the binding free energies and protein residues that interact with the drugs were shown in table 1 the primary targetsactivities of the drugs were also shown in the table energy contributions from different components like electrostatic covalent van der waals lipophilic generalized born electrostatic solvation hydrogen bonds and pi-pi packing towards the total binding energy were given in table 2 from the results presented in table 1 it can be seen that the hydrogen bonding interactions with gly 143 his 163 and glu 166 the three polar amino-acid residues in the active site of the protease are critical in the high affinity binding of the drugs to the protein figure 5 shows the conformation of the bound drugs in the active site of the enzyme and surrounding protein residues md simulations were performed on the top 4 hits selected based on the binding free energies namely binifibrate macimorelin acetate bamifylline and rilmazafon in complex with mpro the conformational changes of the protein and the ligand from the initial structure during the simulation can be expressed in terms of root mean square deviation rmsd any rmsd within 3  is perfectly acceptable for globular proteins larger deviations indicate that the protein is undergoing large conformational changes during the simulation and it means that the protein-ligand complex is unstable the four complexes that were subjected to md simulations showed deviations in protein rmsd is below 3  when compared to initial frame figure 6 the overall values of root mean square fluctuation rmsf which specifies the flexibility of protein residues during the interaction with the drug falls within 3  and hence indicates that the protein is stable while in complex with the drugs in the active site analysis of the ligand rmsd shows that binifibrate and bamifylline do not exhibit large deviations from the initial position indicating that their binding is stable however macimorelin acetate and rilmazafone displayed larger rmsds during the md run indicating that they have less stable binding taken together it is clear that binifibrate and bamifylline possess better binding affinity towards sars-cov-2 mpro active site compared to the other two drugs the interactions of drugs with specific residues of mpro during the md run were shown in figure 7 the major hydrogen bonds which stabilize the binding of binifibrate gly 143 and glu 166 and bamifylline gly143 and glu 166 were persistent during the entire course of the md simulations the hydrogen bonding interactions established by macimorelin acetate with gly 143 his 164 glu 166 thr 190 and rilmazafone with thr 26 gly 143 his 163 glu 166 were eventually lost during the course of the simulation and that accounts for the lower stability of the binding after the md run binding energy of the selected frames from md trajectory was calculated by mm-gbsa for this the structure of each 10 ns frame from the 100 ns total 10 structures md trajectory was exported and binding energy was calculated for each complex the binding energies obtained were averaged and standard deviations were determined table 3 binifibrate showed highest average binding energy during the md run -6778  597 kcalmol and the energy value was similar to the binding energy before the md run -69 04 kcalmol the binding energy values of bamifylline before and after the md run -6319 kcalmol and -6524  620 kcalmol respectively were also similar indicating that the drug interacts with the mpro active site with high stability rilmazafone which had an initial binding free energy of -6137 kcalmol showed a significantly lower energy -3905  615 kcalmol after the md run likewise macimorelin acetate showed a large deviation in binding energy before -6425 kcalmol and after the md run -17362  1453 kcalmol also the rmsd of macimorelin acetate showed a huge variation 15-40  the md simulation indicates that binding of macimorelin to mpro was not stable figure 8 summarises the comparison of binding energy values before and after md simulation and table 3 summarises the contribution of each energy parameters to the binding energy of the simulated systems the md data indicates that the drugs binifirbate and bamifylline might bind to the active site sars-cov-2 mpro and inhibit its activity hence these drugs have the potential to be repurposed against covid-19 however binifibrate a hypolipidemic fibrate drug co-administered along with statins has been presently withdrawn from the market the reason cited for the withdrawal is that the risks associated with the drug outweighs its efficacy as an agent that reduces triglycerides and increases high density lipoprotein-c hdl-c abb vie inc 2016 a rational assessment of the benefits of using binifibrate against covid-19 and the potential side effects should be made before considering it for drug repurposing against covid-19 drug repurposing is perhaps the best way to combat the medical emergency poised by the sars-cov-2 infections that grows in magnitude with the passing of each day repurposing involves screening and identification of known bio-actives against specific therapeutic targets in sars-cov-2 repurposed drugs gets to the market at relatively lesser time periods and costs compared to novel drugs the mpro of sars-cov-2 is involved in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins to form key non-structural components involved in viral multiplication and hence is an attractive target for drug development in the present study using a combination of e-pharmacophore and structure based virtual screening followed by binding energy estimation a subset of known drugs from the superdrug2 database was repurposed against covid-19 out of 4600 drugs from the database after a series of screening four drugs were selected for molecular dynamic simulation studies to check their binding stabilities in the active site of sars-cov-2 mpro based on the md results it was found that binifibrate and bamifylline may bind to the sars-cov-2 mpro active site and inhibit its activity hence binifibrate and bamifylline are two drugs that could be repurposed against covid-19 however it is important to note that binifibrate is currently withdrawn from the drug market because of its side effects it is suggested that a rational risk-benefit analysis should be performed before the drug can be used for repurposing against covid-19 to conclude bamifylline is proposed as potential drug worthy of testing against covid-19 based on the in silico studies described here  a large-scale drug repositioning survey for sars-cov-2

peter schultz g andrew su adolfo garcia-sastre arnab chatterjee k kwok-yung yuen sumit chanda k  the emergence of novel sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in 2019 has triggered an ongoing global pandemic of severe pneumonia-like disease designated as coronavirus disease 2019  to date more than 21 million confirmed cases and 139500 deaths have been reported worldwide and there are currently no medical countermeasures available to prevent or treat the disease as the development of a vaccine could require at least 12-18 months and the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is 10 years repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for covid-19 to identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as sars-cov-2 antivirals we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12000 clinical-stage or fdaapproved small molecules here we report the identification of 30 known drugs that inhibit viral replication of these six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients these include the pikfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod cysteine protease inhibitors mdl-28170 z lvg chn2 vby-825 and ono 5334 and the ccr1 antagonist mln-3897 since many of these molecules have advanced into the clinic the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will accelerate their preclinical and clinical evaluation for covid-19 treatment  in december 2019 the novel sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified as the causative agent of a severe pneumonia-like coronavirus disease covid- 19 outbreak in wuhan in the hubei province of china 1  sars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna betacoronavirus related to the viruses that caused higher than the number of reported cases 34  typical covid-19 symptoms include fever cough anosmia headache anorexia myalgia and in the most severe cases viralinduced pneumonia accompanied by prolonged and systemic cytokine release 5 6  notably the levels of il-6 have been reported to correlate with respiratory failure and inhibitors are currently being pursued in clinical studies for the amelioration of virusinduced inflammatory responses 7  patients with pre-existing chronic conditions such as hypertension diabetes and asthma as well as those 65 years or older are at a higher risk of severe disease outcome 8  the underlying basis for these differential outcomes is yet unknown together the still accelerating rate of community transmission and severity of the symptoms have placed an unprecedented burden on the medical supply chain and health care system in italy spain and the us 9 10 11  with similar scenarios playing out or anticipated in other countries while the fda has recently granted the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine sulfate also known as hydroxychloroquine emergency use authorization eua for covid-19 treatment at present there is no vaccine or approved antiviral therapeutic agent available 12  thus there is an urgent and critical need to identify novel medical countermeasures both for prophylactic and treatment use since the production of a vaccine could take 12-18 months 13  and de novo development of therapies usually requires 10-17 years 14  repositioning clinically evaluated drugs represents one of the most practicable strategies for the rapid identification and deployment of treatments for emerging infectious diseases such as toward this end in addition to many anti-immune treatments not addressed in this paper many investigational clinical trials using repurposed drugs for evaluation of direct antiviral activity have already been launched those include multiple antiviral and antimalarial medicines early results of a multicenter trial in china suggested that the antimalarial drug chloroquine may limit exacerbation of pneumonia and shorten viral replication and course of disease 15  a french study that used hydroxychloroquine together with azithromycin reported a significant reduction in viral load in covid-19 patients when used in combination 16  however a sufficiently powered case-control study has not yet been reported and thus it is unclear if there are therapeutic benefits of chloroquine administration to sars-cov-2-infected patients although several concerns are being raised recently due to the severe cardiac complications potentially resulting from the use of this treatment in covid-19 patients 17 18  the repurposing of several approved antiviral therapies have all been the focus of clinical investigations including hiv-1 protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir kaletra aluvia by abbvie 19  hepatitis c virus protease inhibitor danoprevir ganovo ascletis pharma 20  and the influenza antiviral favipiravir t-705 avigan 21  most notably ten clinical trials at more than 50 global sites are underway to investigate remdesivir gs-5734 an investigational antiviral originally developed by gilead sciences to treat ebola virus infection 22  remdesivir an adenosine analogue is a viral rna polymerase inhibitor that causes premature termination of transcription when incorporated into nascent viral rna 23  the drug has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against both mers and sars 24 25  as well as potent antiviral activity in vero e6 against a clinical isolate of sars-cov-2 26  pending results of several randomized n  308 clinical trials are expected to provide definitive insight into the efficacy of remdesivir as a therapeutic solution for the treatment of covid-19 however a wellpowered randomized controlled trial has yet to demonstrate definitive evidence of antiviral efficacy for remdesivir or any other potential therapeutic while these targeted repurposing strategies provide potentially rapid trajectories toward an approved treatment an unbiased large-scale evaluation of known drugs and clinical candidates can identify additional unanticipated therapeutic options with accelerated evaluation for the treatment of covid-19 disease here we describe a high-throughput repositioning screen using the commercial library of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds lopac1280 and the reframe repurposing focused rescue and accelerated medchem drug collection a comprehensive openaccess library of 12000 clinical-staged or approved small molecules respectively to identify existing drugs that harbor antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in a cell-based assay 27 28  the reframe library has previously been used to successfully identify the anti-inflammatory auranofin as a potential therapy for tuberculosis 29  the approved drug clofazimine as a potent antiparasitic compound that is now being tested for efficacy against cryptosporidium 30  and has also been used to identify and optimize the fdaapproved antifungal drug itraconazole as a novel efficacious molecule suitable for chronic administration as an anti-fibrotic 31  importantly the reframe library is unique in that it is the only repurposing collection we are aware of where nearly 50 of the library was derived from custom synthesis as commercially available sources of these clinical molecules were not available 32  each of the molecules in this collection has been previously optimized for efficacy safety and bioavailability therefore this enables leveraging of the considerable investment in research and development to compress the timeline required for drug discovery and development 33  for example repositioning is estimated to reduce the typical 10-17 year development process to 3-12 years 34  and under emergency use authorization eua for chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn threats during public health emergencies such as the sars-cov-2 pandemic this may be abbreviated to a 6-month time frame here we describe a high-throughput analysis of the reframe library to identify inhibitors of sars-cov-2 replication in mammalian cells and identified several targets and mechanistic classes that were highly enriched including aldose reductase inhibitors retinoic acid receptor antagonists benzodiazepine receptor agonists regulators of cholesterol homeostasis and antimalarial compounds validation studies further confirmed 30 known drugs to inhibit viral replication including four molecules previously approved by the fda clofazimine acitretin tretinoin and astemizole or registered outside the us tamibarotene dose response studies have thus far characterized 7 compounds that exhibit a range of effective concentrations ec 50  that are consistent with potential clinical efficacy these include a pikfyve kinase inhibitor that has reached phase ii clinical trials apilimod and cysteine protease inhibitors mdl-28170 z lvg chn2 vby-825 and ono 5334 that are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development in addition the preclinical ion channel blocker amg-2674 and the ion channer blocker and antimalarial drug hanfangchin a the phase i proton pump inhibitor yh-1238 as well as the g-protein receptor antagonists mln-3897 and sdz-62-434 35  which are in phase ii and phase i clinical evaluation respectively were also found to possess antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 rapid experimental and clinical evaluation of these therapeutics for in vivo antiviral efficacy and amelioration of disease-associated pathologies can provide an important opportunity for the accelerated development of potential therapies for covid-19 treatment sars-cov-2 hku-001a strain was isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate were normalized to the median of each plate for the reframe library the z-score was calculated based on the log2fc with the average and standard deviation of each plate the screen was performed in duplicate by running the assay in parallel for the lopac1280 library or as two independent experiments for the reframe collection twenty-eight compounds from the lopac1280 were selected according to the cutoff of 5stdev log2fc and included in a dose-response confirmation assay compounds from the reframe collection were ranked according to their z-score the top 100 hits from each replicate were selected 25 overlapping seventy-five additional hits were chosen according to their ranking based on the average z-score the last 48 hits were selected according to drug target and pathway enrichment analysis the 298 prioritized hits were included in a dose-response confirmation assay the selected hits were further validated by immunofluorescence in an 8-point dose response experiment to determine ec 50  compounds were annotated in the three databases used to assemble the reframe library clarivate integrity gvk excelra gostar and citeline pharmaprojects according to a variety of properties including targets pathways indications and mechanisms of actions moa each annotation property was tested for enrichment among the screening hits using the gsea software 38 39  the compounds annotated for each property were treated as a gene set for each set of vendor annotations the background compound set was defined as the set of compounds annotated for any property by that vendor enrichment results at p  005 and fdr q-value  025 were defined as significant additional enrichment analyses were performed using the free online meta-analysis tool metascape 40  gene expression analysis was conducted using single-cell rna profiling data of samples from four macro-anatomical locations of human airway epithelium in healthy living volunteers 41 were generated in r using the pheatmap and viridis packages replication one of the most efficient ways to identify antiviral candidates against an emergent virus such as sars-cov-2 that can be rapidly evaluated in clinical trials is to repurpose clinically assessed drugs given the urgent need for therapeutics to treat sars-cov-2 infection we developed a high-throughput assay to screen a comprehensive repurposing library vero e6 cells kidney epithelial cells derived from an african green monkey have been shown to be highly permissive to sars-cov-2 infection 42 and viral replication can be assessed through measurement of viral-induced cytopathic effects cpe 43  a clinical isolate of the sars-cov-2 virus sars-cov-2 hku-001a 36 was utilized for assay development and screening the assay parameters including cell seeding density multiplicity of infection moi and timepoints were optimized in vero e6 cells by measuring virus-induced cpe using celltiter-glo which quantifies cellular atp levels in a 384-well format maximal dynamic range and reproducibility were found at conditions of 3000 cellswell infection at an moi of 001 and cpe measurement at 72 hours post-infection  figure 1a  data not shown in an effort to assess robustness and reproducibility of the optimized assay in a high-throughput screening hts configuration we initially evaluated the assay utilizing repositioning analysis of the reframe drug repurposing library since the results of the lopac1280 hts analysis indicated that these assay conditions were suitable to progress to a large-scale screen we used this experimental design to screen the comprehensive reframe drug repurposing collection this library is an inclusive collection of nearly 12000 chemical compounds that have been either fda-approved or registered outside the us entered clinical trials or undergone significant pre-clinical characterization 27  specifically 11987 compounds were arrayed in 384-well plates at a final concentration of 5 m as with the previous assay vero e6 cells were seeded into each well pre-spotted with compound infected 16 h later with sars-cov-2 moi  001 and at 72 hours post-infection cpe was determined analysis of the average z factor calculated on the activity of apy0201 was determined to be 051 reflecting an acceptable assay dynamic range  figure 1c left panel  the screen was then repeated as an independent replicate and the correlation coefficient r 2  for the two replicates was determined to be 068  figure 1c based on a nominal p-value cutoff of 005 and fdr q-value  025 we found that enriched targets and biological processes include allosteric modulators of the benzodiazepine and retinoic receptors cytosolic nadph-dependent oxidoreductase aldose reductase potassium channels cholesterol homeostasis and serine proteases antimalarials including chloroquine derivatives ie amopyroquine and aq-13 were also enriched although the fdr q-value was below the established threshold 033 figure 2a  figure s2 and table s2  although both the entry receptor for sars-cov-2 ace2 and the priming protease tmprss2 were found to be expressed within specific anatomical sampling locations in the respiratory tract  figure 2b left heatmap  ace2 expression was found to be restricted to epithelial cell types including multiciliated nasal deuterosomal secretory and basal cells figure 2b right heatmap  nonetheless ace2 expression has been reported to be induced by type-i interferon 90  notably a majority of the mapped targets of active compounds also harbored expression in relevant respiratory epithelial cells suggesting these may be physiologically relevant drug targets  figure 2b  further pathway analyses of these enriched moas and targets revealed enrichment in genes involved in nuclear receptor pathways gpcr ligand binding and signaling and calcium signaling figure s3  underscoring the potential critical role of these molecular circuits in cellular control of the sars-cov-2 life cycle 40  candidates for validation studies compounds were ranked according to their z-score in the primary screen  figure s1  and 100 compounds from replicate 1 were prioritized based on this ranking and an additional 75 molecules were selected that were only found in replicate 2 75 compounds were also selected according to their ranking calculated based on the average z-score between the replicates and an additional 48 hits were chosen because they were classified within an enriched drug target and pathway class see above we initially assessed the activity of hits at half the original screening concentration 25 m using an orthogonal assay readout specifically vero e6 cells were pre-incubated with each compound dilution for 16  although specific for each compound therapeutic dose ranges are typically expected to track to cellular ec 50 s well below 1 m concentrations therefore we conducted a dose response analysis to determine the relationship between compound concentration and antiviral activity compound concentrations tested ranged from 11 nm to 25 m in the immunofluorescence assay described previously total cell counts were used to assess compound cytotoxicity  figure s4  in addition to remdesivir treatment with 17 compounds resulted in discernable dose-dependent antiviral activities most of which could be segregated based on broad functional structural or target-based classes figure 3a  10 of these known drugs have ec 50 s  750 nm or values that could not be exactly extrapolated figures 3a and   figure s5  while 7 compounds harbored ec 50 s  500 nm 6 of which reached  80 inhibiton of the infection at the highest concentration figure 3b-c  suggesting that effective antiviral potency could likely be achieved during therapeutic dosing of a covid-19 patient data are also available at reframedborg to enable prioritization of known drugs for preclinical and clinical evaluation for the treatment of sars-cov-2 a summary of the publicly disclosed and relevant preclinical and clinical properties of the most advanced among these molecules are annotated in table 1 information retrieved from cortellistm clarivate analytics and drugscom since the beginning of january 2020 an extraordinary number of investigational programs and clinical trials has been initiated in a concerted effort to identify therapeutics against the rapidly growing covid-19 pandemic clinical trials using here we report the high-throughput analysis of approximately 12000 known drugs evaluated for activity against sars-cov-2 replication the assay conducted in vero e6 cells was designed to capture multicycle replication based upon low viral input moi  001 and an extended endpoint measurement 72 hours post-infection although cell-based assays can be biased towards capturing inhibitors of viral entry the assay was constructed to interrogate each step of the viral life cycle of note one potential limitation of vero cells is that due to species differences pro-drugs that require the human host cell machinery for processing into their active form such as some nucleoside inhibitors may not harbor the same potency as in human cells consistently we found that remdesivir inhibits sars-cov-2 replication 60-fold more potently in human cells in comparison to vero e6 cells  figure 3a and figure s5  data not shown the dynamic range of the viral-induced cpe in the assay was small 2-25 fold but robust and reproducible  figure 1b  both the optimization using the lopac 1280library and the first reframe collection screen displayed acceptable z factors 04 and 051 respectively the duplicate reframe screen had a reduced dynamic range 15-fold and corresponding z factor 0 19  although the correlation between the two reframe replications was high r 2 068 there were compounds that were found active in replicate 1 but not replicate 2  figure 1c  bottom right of middle panel while we leveraged all datasets to select molecules for further validation compound selection was weighted for replicate 1 specifically in addition to 28 molecules from the lopac1280 library 250 drugs were selected based on their activity 48 additional ones belonging to enriched targetmoa sets based on gsea analysis were also included these selected compounds were tested in an orthogonal assay that directly measures viral replication in contrast to the indirect measurement of replication assessed by cpe here we took advantage of a high-throughput immunofluorescence assay that monitors infection levels as reflected by sars-cov-2 n protein expression at a single cell resolution importantly this validation step enables the separation of molecules that function to block cpe ie cell death instead of direct effects on replication this assay was found to be most robust at a 24-hour timepoint using an moi of 075 thus the antiviral activities of compounds were not interrogated under the original moi or 72-hour timepoint conditions both the earlier timepoint and higher moi likely biased the validation screen towards the confirmation of early stage inhibitors consistent with this hypothesis we found that several molecules with potent ec 50 tretinoin clofazimine acitretin were amongst the notable validated compounds since they have been approved by the fda clofazimine is a lipophilic riminophenazine antibiotic with described antimycobacterial and anti-inflammatory activity 65 used for the treatment of leprosy main adverse effects include changes in skin pigmentation nausea and vomiting the antibacterial activity of clofazimine is described to be related to its ability to bind to the bacterial dna interestingly this compound was also identified as a potent antiparasitic drug active against cryptosporidium during a repurposing screen of the reframe library 30  further studies are required to understand the mechanism by which this molecule blocks the replication of this positive-strand rna virus and determination of the dose-response relationship for clofazimine will enable assessment of whether antiviral efficacy can be achieved at therapeutic doses acitretin is an approved orally bioavailable retinoid used for the treatment of psoriasis 66  tretinoin together with tamibarotene which is registered in japan as well as lgd-155 tamibarotene tazarotene and rbad were all validated compounds belonging to the enriched gsea class of class of retinoic acid agonists highly enriched in the gsea analysis figure 2a  it is currently unclear how the activation of the transcriptional program governed by retinoic acid receptors may impinge upon sars-cov-2 replication six additional compounds which confirmed in our validation studies also modulate targets that were enriched in the high-throughput screen those include aldose reductase inhibitor al 3151 the benzodiazepine receptor agonists zk-93426 zaleplon gr and pagoclone and the two antimalarial drugs aq-13 and hanfangchin a antimalarial drugs have been reported to effectively block several viral infections 67  including sars-cov-2 26  however the activities of many of these in particular chloroquine derivatives have not been recapitulated in clinical trials 17 18  drugs belonging to this class are generally reported to be less effective in blocking viral infections compared to their anti-malarial activity with ec 50 generally in a m range 67  the concentration required for their antiviral activity could thus likely be difficult to reach in humans without causing adverse effects taken together confirmation of compounds with membership in enriched target classes underscore the importance of these molecular circuits in the regulation of sars-cov-2 replication and support the evaluation of additional preclinical and clinical stage molecules that target overrepresented mechanisms among the 17 compounds validated to show a dose-response relationship in our orthogonal assay 10 compounds harbored ec 50 antiviral activities 750 nm suggesting that additional preclinical studies will likely be required to determine whether administration of these compounds can achieve sufficient systemic exposure to enable antiviral activity  figure s5  seven molecules were found to inhibit viral replication at ec 50 concentration 500 nm these include z lvg chn2 a preclinical tripeptide derivative that displays a broad-spectrum bactericidal activity specifically this molecule has been previously shown to suppress herpes simplex virus hsv replication by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of hsv-encoded cysteine protease 68  which may indicate that the antiviral function of z lvg chn2 occurs through inhibition of sars-cov-2 3clpro protease another preclinical molecule that exhibits strong antiviral activity mdl 28170 is a potent cell permeable calpain i and ii inhibitor interestingly mdl 28170 was previously found to impair infection by sars-cov-1 and ebola virus ebov 50 69  additionally astemizole a registered anti-histamine h1 receptor antagonist that also reported to have anti-malarial properties 70  inhibited replication at an ec 50 concentration of 11 m due to fatal arrhythmias when given in high doses or in combination with certain other common drugs astemizole has been withdrawn in many countries 71  therefore thorough safety studies are required to determine if there exists a sufficient therapeutic index for the acute treatment of sars-cov-2 infection mln-3897 ave-9897 is an orally active chemokine ccr1 antagonist and was evaluated in phase ii clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra and multiple sclerosis ms 72  showing a dose of 10 mg once daily was well tolerated 73  it was determined to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication at an estimated ec 50 concentration of 140 nm figure 2  and the c max of the compound has been reported at 90 nm 10 mg qd therefore additional in vivo studies will be required to determine if sufficient systemic concentrations can be reached to promote antiviral activities the mechanism by which ccr1 antagonism inhibits sars-cov-2 infection requires further investigation however it has been reported that ccr1 inhibition with mln-3897 potentially blocks erk phosphorylation leading to suppression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase rafmekerk signal transduction pathway 74  interestingly rafmekerk signaling pathways are employed by sars-cov-1 to support its replication via multiple well-documented mechanisms 75 76  and thus this signaling axis may also represent a critical therapeutic target for host-directed sars-cov-2 antivirals human cysteinyl cathepsins including cathepsin b cathepsin l and cathepsin k are required for the proteolytic processing of virally encoded proteins during infection 77 78 79  cathepsin activity seems to be required for proper processing of the sars-cov-1 s protein within the endosome in order to activate its fusogenic acitivity 78  inhibition of cathepsin l activity has been previously shown to efficiently suppress sars-cov-1 infection 78  we found ono 5334 a cathepsin k inhibitor and vby-825 a reversible cathepsin protease inhibitor to inhibit sars-cov-2 infection in a dosedependent manner however additional studies will be required to determine if their antiviral activities are due to inhibiting proteolysis of viral or host cellular proteins ono 5334 harbored an antiviral ec50 of 500 nm which is in range of a previously reported 85  activity observed at 100 nm in an osteoclast-mediated bone resorption assay 80  importantly the cmax of this compound is 16 m 300 mg qd and treatment with ono-5334 was well tolerated up to daily doses of 300 mg and for up to 12 months without any clinically relevant safety concerns ono5334 reached phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women but development was discontinued due to an unfavorable competitive landscape 81 82  vby-825 which is in preclinical development is another cathepsin inhibitor harboring potential antiviral activities against sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 300 nm and it shows high potency against cathepsins b l s and v in vitro 83  overall the identification of vby-825 and ono 5334 as effective antiviral molecules against sar-cov-2 supports the repositioning of these and potentially additional protease inhibitors for the treatment of covid-19 disease finally apilimod a specific pikfyve kinase inhibitor was found to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication at an ec 50 concentration of 23 nm figure 3  importantly apilimod is found to be well tolerated in humans showing a desirable safety profile at doses of  125 mg bid and the cmax of this compound is 0265 -0183 m 70 mg qd 84 85  these data indicate that therapeutic dosing of apilimod in patients can achieve concentrations that are likely to promote antiviral activity apilimod has been evaluated in phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of active crohns disease and rheumatoid arthritis ra 86  and in additional phase ii trials for the oral treatment of common variable immunodeficiency cvid but did not show efficacy for these indications 85 87  in 2019 orphan drug designation was granted to apilimod in the us for the treatment of follicular lymphoma 88  with phase i clinical trials ongoing notably it has been reported that apilimod efficiently inhibits ebov lassa virus lasv and marburg virus marv in human cell lines underscoring its potential broad-spectrum antiviral activity 44 89  the underlying mechanism for the inhibition of sars-cov-2 infection by apilimod is currently not known however since pikfyve predominately resides in early endosomes and plays an essential role in maintenance of endomembrane homeostasis apilimod likely blocks viral low ph-dependent entry through inhibition of the lipid kinase activity of pikfyve taken together this study has illuminated a compendium of druggable targets pathways biological processes and small molecules that modulate the sars-cov-2 replication cycle these data can be leveraged to focus studies aimed at deciphering the biology of this coronavirus and to guide additional directed repurposing studies particularly of existing late-stage preclinical assets critically this campaign led to the identification and validation of 30 molecules with antiviral activities against sars-cov-2 including four fda-approved compounds one drug registered in japan and 11 molecules that have entered clinical trials the availability of human safety and pharmacological data of these molecules is expected to enable rapid preclinical and clinical assessment of these compounds however expedited regulatory review under eua guidelines also provides a rationale for the development of earlier stage candidate molecules that can be deployed for use during this current pandemic outbreak it is critical that multiple therapeutic options that demonstrate efficacy against sars-cov-2 are available to mitigate potential emergence of drug resistance as well as enable the evaluation of optimal therapeutic cocktails that are broadly curative for covid-19 disease table 1 activity and clinical profiles of compounds with confirmed dose-activity relationships that have entered into clinical evaluation drug targets enriched in gsea analysis of hts data fda-approved or gsea-enriched compounds   addressing covid19 drug development with artificial intelligence dean ho   given the aforementioned timelines to realizing novel drugsvaccines drug repurposing particularly as combination therapies has been perhaps the most widely explored among the arsenal of available treatments in times of urgency administering drugs that are approved for human use based on the mechanisms of drug action that may also effectively treat covid19 allows for a rapid response multiple therapies are currently being studied table 1 an open label individually randomized and controlled trial nct02845843 was conducted comparing a combination regimen composed of ritonavir and lopinavir kaletra against the standard of care therapy eg supplemental oxygen ventilation antibiotics and other approaches the study revealed no benefit of ritonavirlopinavir administration over the standard of care treatment and the authors discussed the possibility of combining this regimen with additional therapies to further assess the effectiveness of treatment1 a trial to assess a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is underway nct04321278 remdesivir gilead sciences an investigational therapy previously developed for ebola is currently being investigated via two regimens in a phase 3 clinical trial with the primary outcome being the normalization of oxygen saturation and temperature from first dose to day 14 a secondary outcome is assessing adverse events from first dose to day 10 that may lead to treatment discontinuation nct04292899 aside from these studies a number of trials are being run to assess other repurposed drug combinations these range from favipiravir in combination with tocilizumab nct04310228 lopinavirritonavir ribavirin and interferonbeta nct04276688 hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and tocilizumab nct04332094 and others it is evident that combinatorial drug repurposing is a prevalent and likely on the fastest means of identifying a possible effective therapy against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 viruscovid19 disease however current strategies used to design repurposed drug combinations primarily involve the codelivery of therapies based on the mechanism of action moa followed by dose finding with the objective of finding drug synergy unfortunately drug synergy does not guarantee a successful treatment outcome this approach while established strongly limits the range of drugs that can be considered for use this is because the addition of more drugs into consideration markedly increases the parameter space that is searchable for optimal combinations in addition properly identifying the right doses of each drug in a combination is essential when both drug selection and drug dosing are considered sufficiently interrogating the parameter space becomes insurmountable using traditional screening approaches of note the limited sampling of this parameter space which is virtually assured via traditional combination design and screening is a core driver of why in vitro results do not translate successfully into the clinic take for example a set of 15 candidate therapies against covid19 or any other disease indication if drug 1 is evaluated against the disease model and does not exhibit any apparent efficacy it will conventionally be removed from further consideration however it is possible that drug 1 may be a vital component of the drug combination that mediates optimal treatment efficacy and safety although a 15drug set does not represent a large set of candidate compounds the parameter space that results from 15 drugs and their respective doses is in fact extraordinarily large unfortunately neither traditional drug screening nor traditional combination therapy design is capable of globally optimal drug combinations from a parameter space of this magnitude traditional screening and combination therapy design may also lead to insufficient surveying of a full drugdose parameter space resulting in drug combinations that will not comprehensively reflect the unpredictable drug activity or interactions which can be leveraged to globally optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety in addition partial drugdose parameter space screening can lead to the combinations that may exhibit suitable efficacy in vitro that as previously mentioned cannot be replicated at the patient level unfortunately this approach can often identify certain drugs or combinations as nonefficacious in fact they could be clinically effective while administered in nonobvious combinations at unexpected doses therefore in lieu of moabased drug selection followed by synergistic dose finding simultaneous drug and dose identification among highdimensional search spaces is needed although it is well established in drug dosing that dosing impacts drug efficacy and toxicity it can also determine which drugs belong in a combination therapy regimen in the first place this is among the most overlooked aspects of drug development this is a barrier that can be uniquely addressed using artificial intelligence ai and importantly could enable a markedly enhanced response to covid19 treatment as well as rapid intervention against future outbreaks in the context of deploying ai alongside the infectious disease treatment roadmap it is important to differentiate between the segments of this roadmap first the aforementioned use of ai in drug discovery will undoubtedly lead to promising candidates and these candidates will likely follow a conventional longerterm drug development pathway toward clinical validation studies another segment of this roadmap pertains to drug development which involves patient matching to trials and of note combination therapy design2 when rapid intervention is needed during pandemics for example aibased combination therapy design represents a vital strategy that can identify optimal regimens within a matter of days a number of promising methods have previously been explored in an effort to develop infectious disease drug combinations3 many of the resulting multidrug regimens are based on synergistic drug interactions to amplify treatment efficacy synergy can also be used to predict potent drug combinations during the design process among all of the strategies that are being used however aibased platforms have emerged as promising solutions particularly when they are capable of rapidly optimizing drug combinations without complex disease mechanism data project identifai a recently developed strategy does not require big databased training sets to rapidly pinpoint suitable drug combinations from extraordinarily large parameter spaces4 project identifai is a neural networkbased approach based on a quadratic correlation between inputs defined by drugs and their respective doses and outputs defined by treatment efficacy and safety this correlation markedly reduces the number of assays needed to pinpoint a list of ranked drug combinations that optimize the treatment outcomes based on a maximized index of efficacy and treatment tolerability importantly project identifai can be implemented across the in vitro through clinical phases of drug combination validation importantly the platforms that have served as foundations for the development of project identifai have shown prior clinical successes in indications ranging from oncology to infectious diseases specifically positive treatment outcomes were observed in direct ex vivo to clinical validation studies for hematologic cancer quadratic phenotypic optimization platform qpop5 and the key role of dynamic clinical dosing on efficacy was further validated on an advanced solid cancer patient curateai6 in the area of infectious diseases lowdose treatment for human immunodeficiency virus hiv was shown to mediate undetectable viral loads while opening the doors to possible downstream reductions in treatment complications arising from side effects of highdose therapy curateai7
 project identifai operates in a mechanism and disease indicationagnostic fashion in that it uses prospectively conducted assays composed of systematically designed drugdose combinations on a disease model as such it does not require training data this is because these prospectively conducted assays are conducted in a way to effectively survey the full drugdose parameter space importantly these rationally designed assays define the notion that the way the data are acquired determines our ability to harness ai to optimize treatment as opposed to the sheer volume of data once these prospectively executed assays are completed the corresponding response of the disease model actively drives the optimization process to map out the quadratic correlation from which the optimized combinations can be identified this is akin to agnostically crowdsourcing the disease model to rank out for us what the best to worst drug combinations are without prior knowledge of the drug targets being addressed this is in contrast to traditional approaches which involve validating a set of drugs and set doses among such a massive parameter space there is virtually no way that this strategy can optimize the right drugs and right corresponding doses as such aidriven drug combination design serves as a potential first line of defense in determining the ideal combination therapies to start with as opposed to waiting for the results from completed trials to inform subsequent treatment design aidriven combination therapy design may also avoid the use of suboptimal clinical treatments unnecessary patient mortality and morbidity and may even play a role in preventing downstream drug shortages in looking at all of the existingongoing and upcoming clinical trials against covid19 it is clear that many varieties of combinations have been proposed and will continue to be proposed as potential solutions unfortunately many of these regimens may not result in positive outcomes because the range of combinatorial permutations and corresponding dosing will ultimately not be assessed to a sufficient degree a cursory examination of clinical trial databases of the drugs being repurposed resulting combinations and dosing regimens reveal that only a fraction of the combinatorial space is being addressed although clinical dosing guidelines are well established and are in part guiding the protocols of how these investigational combinations are being deployed there is an opportunity to harness platforms such as identifai to substantially increase the degree of actionability of the interventions being developed when drug combinations are eventually optimized using aidriven and related methods new capabilities will likely emerge for example aidriven optimization that is conducted during varying stages of infection will likely result in drugdose compositions and rankings that correspond with each stage as pathogens evolve over time the ability to rapidly intervene using aidriven reoptimization may also be enabled despite the considerable challenges being encountered with covid19 therapy the results observed thus far represent an opportunity to unite multinational capabilities in infectious disease drug development with ai to develop broadly deployable regimens for the benefit of the global community at present novartis mylan teva pharmaceuticals and bayer have collectively committed to donating over 220 million chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tablets these efforts have been backed by the manufacturing capabilities of torrent pharmaceuticals cadila pharmaceuticals and ipca laboratories among others gilead sciences has committed to donating 15 million doses of remdesivir and toyama chemical has also committed its favipiravir therapy for free to the global community to complement the trials currently underway the world health organization who has initiated the solidarity clinical trial in an effort to facilitate data sharing to accelerate the assessment of treatment outcomes of multiple regimens being studied across the globe these include local standard of care in addition to remdesivir chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine ritonavir and lopinavir and ritonavir lopinavir and interferon beta 1alpha this collection of monotherapies and combinations being assessed represents an ideal opportunity for ai deployment and the systematic derivation of actionably optimized regimens and can potentially provide a path toward sustained preparedness for future outbreaks and pandemic prevention the author is an inventor of pending patents pertaining to artificial intelligencebased drug development  chemistry and biology of sars-cov-2 alexander dmling li gao   in december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia of an unknown cause was reported in wuhan in hubei province china it was speculated that the first patient caught the infection from a seafood market that also traded wild animals the causing agent was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus cov the cov responsible for the outbreak is now called sars-cov-2 the respiratory illness caused by sars-cov-2 is called covid-19 the symptoms of the sars-cov-2 infection range from asymptomatic to mild to severe to death1 it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring as was the case with the previous human cov in an unprecedented documented speed the sars-cov-2 travels around the globe and as of april 27th led to 30 million infections and 200000 fatalities based on the previous experience with the sars-cov outbreak at the beginning of this century very stringent measures were taken by the chinese government and several multimillion-inhabitant cities were isolated and put under quarantine in order to slow the pandemic spread different hosts of the sars-cov-2 are proposed including snails bats and pangolins2
 covs are a large family of zoonotic viruses and their outbreaks are common to humans although major outbreaks have been experienced in animals especially in cattle under the electron microscope they exhibit formations that are reminiscent of the solar corona the common cold is often caused by human covs they are single-stranded enveloped positive rna viruses and stand out because of their rather large genome as with viruses in general the structure is rather simple sars-cov-2 is generally less pathogenic than sars-cov much less pathogenic than the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov but more pathogenic than practically harmless hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 the reported case-fatality rate of covid-19 is 3 and is thus rather low as compared with sars 30 table 1
 however the transmission rate tr number of newly infected people per infected person of 25 to 3 is high and accounts for the danger of the current pandemic for comparison the tr of the yearly common cold is less than 14 advice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of sars-cov-2 infected pneumonia have been shared rapidly3
 what are the issues and chances for a rapid approval of a new medicine to treat covid-19 in principle there are several potential strategies to pharmacologically fight covid-19 vaccines monoclonal antibodies oligonucleotide-based therapies peptides interferon therapies small-molecule drugs or natural medicines eg traditional chinese medicine tcm the timelines for de novo development of a small-molecule drug are historically 67 years and in the best case less than 2 years vaccines can be developed much faster but rapid development in the range of 12 years is very challenging antibodies to support the bodys immune system are also a strategy to combat viral diseases again the typical development timelines are several years therefore is there a hope for a rapid drug to come to the market a strategy that is promising in the current situation is drug repurposing drug repurposing aims to discover novel indication areas for already approved drugs4 the overwhelming advantage of drug repurposing is the potential for much faster approval because of the already extensive knowledge of the drugs behavior in humans an expert opinion on the potential for repurposing existing antiviral agents to treat covid-19 some of which are already clinically evaluated was recently given5 here we discuss molecular targets of the sars-cov-2 some of the known small molecules and the potential for repurposing existing drugs both the virus-encoded proteases are involved in the processing of the two viral polyproteins in a coordinated manner and thus comprise important drug targets the structure function and inhibition of cov 3clpro also called mpro has been recently comprehensively reviewed6 the 3clpro is a cysteine protease that cleaves and processes the viral polyproteins sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share 96 sequence identity in their 3clpro on the basis of the rapidly published virus sequence data a homology model was created7 moreover an x-ray structure of the c3lpro covalently bound to a peptidomimetic acrylester 1 is now available figure 2
 pdb id 6lu78
 because of the high sequence similarity of different cov 3clpros a lot of previously described inhibitors can be considered to be of great use in the current sars-cov-2 a majority of inhibitors of the 3clpro are covalent in nature binding to the active-site cysteine scheme 1
 different electrophilic warheads are known including -halocarbonyl acrylamides sulfonyl chlorides aldehydes 29 isatines 310 or -ketoheteraromates 46 many of the molecules are rather large and are based on extensive amide chemistry mimicking part of the peptide substrate of the protease moreover their selectivity toward other potential targets in the human body has not been established interestingly some compounds binding to the active site of the 3clproalthough using a noncovalent mechanismhave been established a high-throughput screening hts identified 33-dihydropyrazolidine 5 which displayed 135-triaryl substitution patterns as sars-cov 3clpro inhibitors11 nitroanilides 6 derived from the drug niclosamide were also found to inhibit 3clpro12 -aminoacylamides were identified by an hts and a strong stereochemical effect was noted the simple one-pot accessible scaffold by an ugi-four component condensation was the key to rapidly generate structure activity relationship sar for the putative p2-p1 and p1 subgroups an optimized version ml188 7 was designated as the probe status figure 3
 a p3 truncated version of 8 allowing for significant molecular weight mw reduction without diminishing potency was developed as a second probe ml300 9 with potent enzyme inhibition and cellular activity these compounds comprise rare examples of a noncovalent sars-cov 3clpro inhibitor of moderate mw with good enzyme and antiviral inhibitory activity however these molecules suffer from extensive metabolism and rapid clearance nonetheless they are a promising starting point for further drug development even if such compounds cannot be rapidly developed to cope with the current situation their development is highly warranted to be prepared for likely future cov outbreaks it is noteworthy that different computational approaches including machine learning have been published to propose approved drugs potentially binding to 3clpro drug repurposing13

14 one such approach virtually screened commercial medicines in the drugbank database for binding into the active site of mpro15 ten different commercial medicines were proposed that might form hydrogen bonds to key residues within the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 3clpro which might have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir or ritonavir flavonoids 1014 are plant-derived natural products with diverse reported biological activities and they have been shown to be also able to inhibit the 3clpro figure 4

17 the broad-spectrum and established use of plant-based medicines to combat infectious diseases in tcm is the basis of several currently ongoing clinical trials in china one of the largest among them assesses shuanghuanglian a chinese herbal medicine that contains extracts from the dried fruit lianqiao forsythiae fructus which is purported to have been used for treating infections for more than 2000 years several approved hiv protease inhibitors 15 16 and 18 were previously repurposed for the treatment of sars scheme 2
18 19 20 they were hypothesized to inhibit the sars-cov 3clpro hiv protease is a asp protease and differs considerably from the cys protease 3clpro but it also shares some common elements such as a tetrahedral transition state and receptor pockets to recognize the amino acid side chains of the substrates given that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share very high identical sequence in their 3clpro these hiv protease inhibitors are currently again repurposed for the treatment of covid-19 chinese clinical trial registry chictr200002953921 22 23
 the coronaviral plpro is another attractive antiviral drug target because it is essential for cov replication the structure function and inhibition of the sars-cov plpro has been extensively reviewed24 although the primary function of plpro and 3clpro is to process the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner plpro has the additional function of stripping ubiquitin and isg15 from host-cell proteins to help cov to evade the host innate immune responses therefore it was recently argued that targeting plpro with antiviral drugs might have an advantage in not only inhibiting viral replication but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that might lead to cell death in surrounding uninfected cells24 different compounds forming a covalent bond to the active-site cys112 have been described including epoxyketones -halo-ketones alkynes aldehydes trifluoromethyl ketones -unsaturated ketone activated esters or vinyl sulfones disulfiram 19 an approved drug for the treatment of chronic alcohol dependence has a great potential for drug repurposing because it has been shown to inhibit plpro of mers-cov and sars-cov25 the antimetabolites 6-mercaptopurine 20 and 6-thioguanine 21 are additional drugs inhibiting plpro potent naphthyl methylamine hits 22 which have been structurally characterized and have been subsequently optimized toward better metabolic stability were identified from an hts campaign27 2328 the naphthyl methylamines work through a noncovalent mechanism and show a rather drug-like appearance figure 5
 the envelope-anchored s protein mediates cov entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor and then fusing viral and host membranes the sars-cov-2 s protein was solved by cryoelectron microscopy and just released29 knowing the -resolution structure of the sars-cov-2 spike will allow for additional protein engineering efforts that could improve antigenicity and protein expression for vaccine development moreover the -resolution detail will enable the design and screening of small molecules with fusion-inhibiting potential it is the affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain rbd and the host receptor in the initial viral attachment step that primarily determines which host is susceptible to sars-cov infection the sars-cov-2 entry through receptor binding was elucidated independently by several groups30

31 on the basis of the rich knowledge about sars-cov and the sequence homology it was suggested that sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as its receptor figure 6
 it uses the sars-cov receptor ace2 and the cellular protease tmprss2 for entry into target cells30

31 the interplay of the ace receptor in cardiovascular diseases with the well-known drug class of ace inhibitors and as the docking point for sars-cov-2 cellular infection is a current point of intense debate and research32
 it was found that several critical residues in sars-cov-2 rbm particularly gln493 provide favorable interactions with human ace2 consistent with sars-cov-2s capacity for human cell infection on the basis of the extensive modeling of the virus-human receptor interactions it was also predicted that a single n501t mutation might significantly enhance the binding affinity between sars-cov-2 rbd and human ace2 and thus potentially lead to much more virulent bodies30

31 the emergency and evolution of novel mutations at the 501 position in sars-cov-2-infected and covid-19 patients have to be closely monitored33
 mutations in the s protein are the ones causing the zoonosis and as a result not all of them will lead to their binding to ace2 therefore drugs targeting the s protein-ace2 interaction might not apply to some of the future covs on the other hand the spike-shaped protein on the surface of the viruses causing sars mers and covid-19 provides a tantalizing target for antibodies or other compounds which could prevent covs from invading human cells35 the virus s protein seems to emerge as the consensus target antigen the rdrp enzyme allows the viral genome to be transcribed into new rna copies by using the host cells machinery rdrp inhibitors are emerging as a new strategy to fight viral infections35 the chemistry and biology of rdrp have been extensively reviewed36
 rna polymerase inhibitors are promising agents to fight covid-195 rdrp proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share 96 sequence identity favipiravir 24 is an approved rna polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of the influenza pandemic it has been shown not only to be active in influenza but also active against other rna viruses figure 7
34 favipiravir is a prodrug which is metabolized in cells into the active purine nucleotide that mimics favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate that inhibits the rna replication and thus the viral progression37 interestingly it does not inhibit host dna and rna synthesis and inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh activity favipiravir reportedly demonstrated efficacy with minor side effects in an ongoing 70-patient clinical trial in shenzhen guangdong province5 the drugs generic version received approval by the health authorities in china38
 the broad-spectrum antiviral drug remdesivir together with chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel cov sars-cov-2 in vitro39

40 remdesivir 25 reduced sars-cov-2 infection of monkey kidney cells with an ec50 of 077 m the compound is in late-stage clinical development and has been recently described to inhibit multiple rna viruses on a cellular level including ebola and sars the presumed mode of action of the adenosine analog prodrug remdesivir is pre-mature rna synthesis termination by incorporation into nascent viral rna chains41 galidesivir 26 is another antiviral drug under clinical development with potential in covid-19 treatment figure 7 it is an adenosine analog and is currently developed for ebola virus disease and marburg virus disease it also shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against rna virus families including covs42
 multiple other rdrp inhibitors are described in the literature for example broad-spectrum antiviral 6-bis fluorinated aristeromycin analog 2743
 chloroquine 28 is an existing anti-malaria medicine also used to treat several other diseases it blocked virus infection with an ec50 of 113 m39

40 its mode of action is unclear however chloroquine inhibits endosomal acidification and thus could stop the release of viral dna into the cytoplasm it is under assessment in more than 100 patients at over ten hospitals in beijing and guangdong province plans for an additional study in hunan province are underway the role of the other sars-cov-2 n proteins as drug-discovery targets is less clear for the assembly of the replicationtranscription complexes there is a vast interaction network described between the non-structural proteins similarly viral particle assembly requires orchestrated interaction between n s m and e proteins all these interactions can be potential targets but the structural information is currently minimal resolution of the protein and complex structures will provide new unique drug targets for example the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 n protein rna-binding domain was just published and will give structural insight as a potential drug target44 it is rapidly detected by antibodies in serum plasma and peripheral blood and might therefore serve to develop specific diagnostics using methods of machine learning-enabled scientific literature analysis the biotech company benevolentai proposed the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 as a host target to fight sars-cov-2 aak1 is the key enzyme of receptor-mediated endocytosis which is the major mechanism of most viruses to enter their host cells thus they predict the approved for rheumatoid arthritis kinase inhibitor baricitinib 29 to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells figure 8

 the recent emergence of the wuhan cov sars-cov-2 has put the world on alert the rapid worldwide spread and the high human-to-human transmissibility combined with the inability to contain the pandemic is causing an increasing death toll and also considerable paralysis of the world economy table 2 the covid-19 could decrease and disappear or could be established worldwide in the human population and reoccur seasonally in future mutations through zoonosis from one of the animal reservoirs however it is very likely that in the upcoming years we will see more outbreaks from cov and other viruses the basic translational and public health research communities have to prepare for this much better the outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for renewed efforts to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents to combat covs on the positive side much new information of the virus biology and the spread was immediately shared whereas on the negative side many past opportunities to develop antivirals against covs were not taken despite a large number of promising approaches and compounds46 the past decade has shown that cov outbreaks are regularly reoccurring with more or less health effect on human and livestock it remains to be hoped that the current pandemic will slow down and end as predicted in summer furthermore it turns out that containment measures are not effective to avoid more severe spread it remains to be seen whether efficient and long-lasting immunity will develop in the infected population with regard to future outbreaks and whether pharmacological measures can be rapidly developed to be able to treat severely sick people

  drug repurposing a better approach for infectious disease drug discovery g law lynn jennifer tisoncik-go marcus korth j michael katze g   drug development research for infectious diseases has led to a number of effective therapies in the 20th century however there are still many diseases for which no drugs or vaccines are available for other diseases such as those caused by influenza virus or hepatitis c virus treatments are suboptimal and effective for only a subset of the population reductionist or structure-based drug design efforts rely on de novo predictions of how a select set of small molecules or compounds will interact with targeted pathogen or host proteins such predictions are typically difficult time consuming and costly additional approaches are needed to discover new treatments and to improve on existing ones one promising approach is drug repurposing or repositioning that is applying known drugs or compounds to new indications 1 2 although this idea is not new past techniques have relied on hypothesis-driven approaches that usually involve computational matching of compounds to specific viral or human proteins requiring a large amount of expert knowledge on the chemical compound and drug target under study recent developments have opened the door to using drug repurposing approaches that do not rely on generating empirical data related to binding characteristics or mechanism of action instead these approaches use the methods of systems biology and bioinformatics to directly compare the host response to pathogen and drug the computational methods used in this paradigm vary in complexity from genomic signature comparisons to complicated interaction networks in combination with systematic databases of drug-induced gene expression profiles these methods utilize data from a variety of high-throughput techniques eg transcriptomics proteomics or metabolomics thus allowing for the identification of potential host drug targets on a global-scale figure 1
 because of the significantly reduced timeframe for predicting host molecules for effective therapeutic intervention and because these compounds are typically previously fda-approved drugs or small molecules these approaches have the potential to greatly reduce both the time and cost associated with drug development importantly there has already been successful application of these approaches for several disease indications 3 the time is therefore at hand for the infectious disease field to embrace a new paradigm in an effort to improve effective drug discovery to illustrate the immediate accessibility and potential of this approach we discuss examples both in and outside of the infectious disease field that have relied on systems-wide host response datasets publicly available datasets of known drugs or small molecules and computational approaches that are used to predict potentially effective diseasedrug combinations in the simplest of terms the inverse genomic signature approach is based on the premise that an effective drug generates a gene expression profile that is inversely correlated to the host signature associated with the disease this approach incorporates the complexity of the genome-wide response of the host to both the disease and the treatment and is rooted in scalar theory 4 5 6 that is the mrna expression profiles contain information associated with higher-level protein interactions concordant with either the disease or drug treatment most examples of this approach use connectivity map cmap 7 a public database httpwwwbroadinstituteorgcmap version 2 that holds over 6000 transcriptome profiles established downstream of treatment of human cell lines with over 1300 compounds most of which are fda-approved drugs in addition to the transcriptome profiles the cmap resource provides analytical tools which among other things can calculate a connectivity score this score is a measure of the inverse similarity or negative correlation between signatures as an example dudley et al used this method to identify new therapeutic agents against inflammatory bowel disease ibd a progressive inflammatory disorder for which there is no known cure current treatments have severe side effects are expensive and are ineffective for many individuals 8 in this study a modified version of the computational methodology developed by lamb et al 7 9 was used to compare a compendium of 164 known drug compounds in cmap to an ibd-specific gene expression signature derived from 176 datasets available in gene expression omnibus geo two of the strongest anti-correlated treatment signatures were from prednisolone a well-known treatment for crohns disease a major type of ibd and topiramate an anticonvulsant drug used to treat epilepsy using a rodent model of ibd it was shown that topiramate significantly reduced gross pathology and microscopic damage in the affected colon compared with that seen in control animals importantly topiramates side effects in treatment of neurological symptoms in humans are not as severe as current ibd treatments in one of the first applications of this approach to an infectious disease josset et al used the host transcriptional response to influenza virus to query the cmap database 10 the majority of current antiviral drugs target specific viral proteins making them narrow in spectrum and vulnerable to the emergence of viral resistance josset and co-workers reasoned that treating virus infection by stimulating or manipulating the innate immune response or by targeting cellular factors required for the viral life cycle would prove advantageous over the more traditional approach of targeting a viral protein a common gene expression signature consisting of 20 dysregulated genes was identified from human a549 lung epithelial cells infected with human h1n1 or h3n2 or avian h5n1 h5n2 or h7n1 influenza a virus the cmap database was then queried to identify candidate compounds with genomic signatures that were inversely correlated to the common influenza virus-induced host transcriptome profile eight candidate drugs were identified the majority of which are approved for other indications six of these drugs inhibited viral growth in in vitro assays importantly five out of the eight also inhibited the growth of the pandemic 2009 h1n1 influenza virus which had not been used to define the common signature the approach therefore has the potential to identify drugs effective against a spectrum of related viruses an additional exciting aspect of the inverse genomic signature approach is its ability to rapidly identify potential drugs for emerging infectious diseases as demonstrated by a recent study from our laboratory in which we determined the host response to the newly discovered middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 11 mers-cov was first identified in saudi arabia in september 2012 and has since caused at least 77 confirmed infections resulting in 40 deaths using human calu-3 cells a cell line derived from epithelial cells lining the human conducting airway and global transcriptional profiling of the host response a 207-gene signature of the early host response was identified using this signature and two independent bioinformatics tools the cmap connectivity score and ipa upstream regulator analysis ingenuity systems wwwingenuitycom two kinase inhibitors sb203580 and ly294002 were identified as potential anti-mers-cov treatments to validate the top predicted negative regulator cells were treated with sb203580 before mers-cov infection this resulted in a significant reduction in viral titers at both 24 and 48 hours post infection this study demonstrates the potential of in silico approaches to predict drug candidates and the in vitro efficacy of sb203580 against mers-cov whereas the studies just described focused on the use of gene expression patterns it is also possible to take advantage of the deeper understanding of the host response that comes from network modeling biomolecular networks connect molecular components such as genes proteins or metabolites by specific types of interactions and are used to represent the functional relationship among the various components of the network 12 functional relationships can be physical or chemical interactions genetic regulatory interactions or other associations networks may be constructed to capture various scales ranging from molecular and cellular levels to tissue and organismal levels and network dynamics can be analyzed to provide information about complex diseases infer novel relationships and reveal emergent properties of the biological system the application of systems biology to infectious disease research is increasingly being used to identify host targets for antimicrobial therapeutics and for the prediction of novel pathogen virulence factors 13 14 15 with the wealth of functional genomics data that are now publicly available network pharmacology can begin to make inroads into infectious disease research although an in-depth review of network-based approaches for drug repurposing is beyond the scope of this article several recent reviews have focused on the complexity of human disease networks 16 tools for analyzing network topology and dynamics 4 and network and drug combinations 17 here we discuss recent studies that have used network-based approaches for target identification and drug discovery to identify novel genes for drug targeting barrenas et al 18 built upon the knowledge that genes containing disease-associated snps tend to form highly connected clusters in proteinprotein interaction networks as do genes that are differentially expressed in complex diseases this information was used to identify highly interconnected gene clusters or core-susceptibility modules from 13 highly diverse complex diseases this was done by constructing individual disease-specific networks using a global human proteinprotein interaction network and gene expression datasets for each disease 19 highly interconnected clusters that overlapped between the disease networks were then determined and the use of a permutation test revealed a significant level of snp enrichment obtained from 20 in each core-susceptibility module compared with the whole proteinprotein interaction network to test if this correlation between core-susceptibility modules and snps could identify novel host drug targets or novel genes associated with disease susceptibility the network construction and analysis was repeated using gene expression and snp datasets from another complex disease seasonal allergic rhinitis sar ie hay fever this analysis identified two novel sar-associated genes fibroblast growth factor 2 fgf2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 mapk8 the latter known to play a role in type 1 allergic inflammation the potential functional relevance of fgf2 as a drug target was confirmed when it was knocked down in polarized th2 cells which resulted in the dysregulation of genes involved in type 1 allergic inflammation drug repurposing strategies may also be valuable for finding therapeutics against rare diseases where there is little financial incentive for drug development as an example mei et al 21 used a multiple-level network modeling mlnm approach to identify drugs to treat rare central nervous systems cns diseases using publicly available disease-gene expression profiles pathophysiological pathway analysis and information on fda-approved drugs and late-stage compounds an integrated cns disease network was constructed in which diseases were linked in relationship to the degree of commonly shared pathways expression patterns or responses to drugs or compounds using robust association statistical cutoffs hierarchical clustering and the hypothesis that similar diseases are caused by the dysregulation of related pathways several potential drugs were identified for example these results predicted that parkinsons disease drugs could be effectively repurposed as a therapy for basal ganglia disease similarly this approach showed that multiple sclerosis ms and neuromyelitis optica an autoimmune disorder consisting of simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve and the spinal cord share common mechanistic pathways suggesting that ms drugs could be effective against both diseases in a novel approach daminelli et al used off-target effects of known promiscuous drugs to their advantage in a network-based strategy that integrated publicly available drugtarget and drugdisease interactions 22 using the resulting integrated drugtargetdisease network new links between drugs targets and diseases were identified and evaluated for example quercetin a bioflavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties 23 and resveratrol a polyphenolic compound found in red wine and once speculated to explain the french paradox 24 were predicted to bind the same two targets pik3gc and lta4h known binding partners of quercetin and resveratrol respectively and potentially be effective against neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases a literature search revealed that quercetin binding to lta4h had recently been verified using an in vitro pull-down assay although resveratrol does not appear to bind directly to pik3gc it can inhibit pik3gc phosphorylation and has been reported to have anti-tumor activity 25 26 27 drug repurposing approaches therefore show promise for identifying drugs to treat a variety of diseases including infectious disease however there are also caveats to be aware of and steps to be taken to ensure that these approaches bear fruit for instance most if not all publicly available drug profiles have been obtained using cell lines as model systems meaning that information related to intercellular mechanisms is not captured additional public funding is needed for more extensive databases that expand the number of drugs profiled and the model systems used equally important is the availability of datasets of the host response to infectious diseases to this end the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid has sponsored five systems biology centers for infectious disease research 28 these centers focus on modeling the host response to pathogens such as influenza virus sars-cov mycobacterium tuberculosis salmonella typhimurium yersinia pestis and most recently malaria parasites the resulting host-response datasets along with a significant amount of metadata are captured by the niaid bioinformatics resource centers thereby allowing investigators to use these extensive systematically obtained genomic proteomic and metabolomic datasets for computational studies there are also currently limitations to the computational tools used to integrate drug and host-response profiles existing pattern-matching techniques use prior knowledge in the form of gene ontology and functional annotation databases such as gokegg or ingenuity pathway analysis this limits the searchable patterns to already known pathways additionally cmap can only be searched with simple short differentially expressed gene lists rather than complex datasets obtained using multiple biological conditions and covering all human genes this results in greater bias and lower throughput additional methods need to be developed to overcome these limitations of course once potential drugs are identified through these approaches steps must still be taken to validate clinical efficacy 29 in this review we have highlighted the use of mrna and proteomic profiles however other system-wide metrics could potentially be used including profiles of micrornas long noncoding rnas or epigenetic modifications with the recent us supreme court decision to ban patents on human genes it is not hard to imagine that soon an individuals genetic makeup and personal genomic disease signatures will be screened against drug databases for a more tailored and personalized medical treatment finally by identifying compounds that have already been evaluated in human subjects drug repurposing approaches may be of particular benefit for identifying treatments that can be employed against rare or emerging infectious diseases as an adjunct to the more common approaches of high-throughput screening and structure-based drug design computational drug repurposing has the potential to rapidly translate insights gained through systems biology into a drug discovery strategy directly applicable to the treatment of infectious disease papers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted as of special interest
  evaluating the potential of different inhibitors on rna-dependent rna polymerase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 a molecular modeling approach shuvasish choudhury debojyoti moulick purbajyoti saikia muhammed mazumder khairujjaman   a novel coronavirus emerging from wuhan in china in december 2019 has now spread to over 213 countriesterritories across the globe httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 the virus originally named 2019-ncov has now been renamed by taxonomists as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 owing to its genomic and structural similarities with the earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov1 2 3 the disease caused by this virus has been named by the world health organizationas coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and the outbreak was declared a pandemic on 11th march 2020 as of april 27 2020 the virus has affected over 2883603 people and killed more than 198842 and the figures are increasing rapidly today the covid-19 pandemic has become the largest global health crisis a burden on healthcare systems and is affecting global trade and economy so far there exists no specific drug or vaccine for the treatment of covid-19 because de novo drug discovery is a time-consuming venture researchers have suggested drug repurposing as a strategy to find a therapeutic against the virus the approved drugs against other viruses including the similar sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv have been suggested for further evaluation and clinical studies1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 in addition the knowledge gained through studies of these related viruses has been vital in designing therapeutics against sars-cov-2 structural biology approaches have deciphered the structures of different proteinsenzymes of the sars-cov-2 and at least three of them such as rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp papain-like protease and the main protease are important drug targets5

6 rdrp is the key enzyme which replicates the viral rna genome and is thus the most promising drug target the rdrp of the sars-cov-2 shares 96 sequee identity with the sars-cov9 and thus the compounds or drugs effective against the rdrp of sars-cov are surmised to be effective against the novel cov as well this makes the rdrp the most important therapeutic target against sar-cov-2 recent studies have suggested several known rdrp-inhibiting antivirals other fda-approved drugs and phytochemicals for repurposing against sars-cov-2 using molecular docking studies7 some of the commonly repurposed drugs include ritonavirlopinavir remdesivir hydroxychloroquine ribavirin and so on in view of the previously mentioned fact the present study investigates the relative efficacy of the known rdrp inhibitors as well as other drugscompounds which have been predicted to have rdrp-inhibiting potential using computational modeling the drug target for the present study is rdrp of sars-cov-2 the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme in complex with cofactors was obtained from the research collaboratory for structural bioinformatics rcsb protein data bank wwwrcsborgpdb bearing pdb id 6m71 the structure was determined using electron microscopy at resolution of 290  by gao et al10 and deposited to the database on march 16 2020 the structure bears three non-structured proteins nsps such as one nsp7 and two nsp8 as cofactors the chain a is the nsp12 which is the rdrp and it contains 851 amino acids the structure was downloaded from the database in pdb format thirty compounds were selected from the available literature as test drugs the list includes known rdrp inhibitors as well as other drugscompounds which have been predicted to inhibit the drug target table 1
 the three-dimensional conformers of the compounds were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi pubchem compounds database wwwpubchemncbinlmnihgov and were downloaded in sdf format molecular docking is a powerful computational modeling tool which determines the affinity of binding of any compound with the active site of a receptorenzyme the molecular docking also determines the orientation of binding of the compound at the active site of the enzyme the amount of energy thus liberated which is a negative value determines the stability of the ligandreceptor complex and is referred to as a docking score a compound with a higher ie more negative docking score forms a more stable ligandprotein complex and is surmised to be a better inhibitor11

12 furthermore when a compound shows higher affinity for the active site of an enzyme compared with the natural substrate it interferes with the activity of the enzyme and may bring about competitive inhibition in the present study the molecular docking was performed using molegro virtual docker software 60 mvd following standard procedures11

12 mvd is one of the most widely used and powerful tools in determining ligandprotein interactions and has higher accuracy 87 than many other similar tools13
 briefly the structure of the enzyme was loaded into the software with all the cofactors this was followed by addition of the structures of the test compounds into the workspace docking was performed between the ligands and the active site of the receptorenzyme with grid resolution of 030  moldock scoring function and including amino acids within a radius of 20  around x 12274 y 10669 z 15525 as the active site residues once the docking scores were obtained the best pose in terms of the rerank score for each compound was retained and the binding geometry or conformation was assessed while performing docking incorporation of remdesivir as a test ligand for the present study has two implications first it was included to see its relative affinity compared with the other compounds for the active site of the enzyme and thereby predict its relative efficacy as an inhibitor of rdrp of sars-cov-2 second the drug being a nucleoside analog interacts at the active site of the enzyme and thus serves as a reference ligand in the present study all the test compounds except cortisone were found to interact at the same active site or binding pocket fig 1
a as that of the remdesivir fig 1b this demonstrates that all the compounds have the potential to interact at the same active site of the enzyme and may interfere with the activity of the enzyme binding or interaction of the ligands at the active site of an enzyme implicates that the ligands would interfere with the activity of the enzyme thereby bringing about inhibition of the enzyme the free energy of binding or the docking score implicates the efficacy with which the inhibition is affected chlorhexidine was found to have the highest affinity among all the studied compounds for the active site of rdrp followed by remdesivir novobiocin ceftibuten and ribavirin table 1 the docking score of chlorhexidine 13285 was found to be 116-fold higher than that of remdesivir 11447 while the hydrogen bond score of chlorhexidine 7996 was found to be 142-fold higher than that of remdesivir 5644 furthermore the docking score of remdesivir was found to be 104-fold 111-fold and 113-fold higher than that of novobiocin ceftibuten and ribavirin respectively table 1 among all the compounds cortisone was found to have a positive rerank score this indicates that the compound may not be able to interact with and inhibit the rdrp using molecular docking studies researchers have identified several known and novel compounds as inhibitors of different drug targets of the sars-cov-2 for the viruses using rdrp for replication of their genetic material rna including covs and hiv inhibition of rdrp is one of the most crucial therapeutic strategies which is primarily affected by nucleoside analogs the rdrp of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have 97 sequence identity while the active site of the rdrp of most covs and rna viruses is highly conserved5 this has been the basis for drug repurposing against sars-cov-2 using those compounds which are known to inhibit the rdrp of related viruses the present study reveals that remdesivir has the highest potential in binding and therefore competitively inhibiting rdrp of sars-cov-2 among all known rdrp inhibitors table 1 the inhibitory potential of the same on the rdrp has also been reported from other molecular modeling studies7

14 remdesivir is an adenosine analog and its incorporation into the growing viral rna leads to termination of the rna replication high affinity of the compound for the active site of rdrp of the sars-cov-2 indicates that the compound would compete with the natural substrates ribonucleotides of the rdrp and get incorporated into the growing rna chain remdesivir has been suggested by several researchers for use in patients with covid-19 to reduce viral load1 2 3 4 5 6 7 the compound has already been reported to inhibit replication of the virus in vitro in vero e6 cells15 remdesivir has earlier been reported to inhibit a spectrum of human rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov marburg virus hendra virus nipah virus ebola virus and hiv2

16 17 18 19 20 21 remdesivir was used for successful treatment of the first covid-19 case of the us22 a large number of clinical trials are going on in different countries to evaluate the effectiveness of this compound in patients with covid-19 in the present study chlorhexidine has been found to have highest affinity for the active site of the rdrp of sars-cov-2 table 1 fig 1c the compound was found to bind to the same active site of the rdrp and is therefore predicted to be a promising inhibitor nevertheless the mode of inhibition of this compound would be different from that of nucleoside analogs such as remdesivir this is because nucleoside analogs mimic the natural substrates of rdrp and act as chain terminators unlike chlorhexidine chlorhexidine can not mimic natural substrates of rdrp and will not be incorporated into the viral rna rather it may block the active site of the enzyme and thereby inhibit the entry of the substrates ie nucleotides at the site this will prevent activity of rdrp thereby preventing replication of the viral genome rather than terminating it this compound has also been predicted by wu et al7 as an inhibitor of rdrp using molecular docking approaches chlorhexidine is one of the most widely used drugs against dental plaques gingivitis pharyngitis candidiasis and tonsillitis23 it is a bactericidal fungicidal and virucidal agent and is known to alter membrane potential24 and inhibit atpase25 at concentrations ranging from 0001 to 2 the drug is known to inhibit a wide range of viruses and for coronaviruses it shows effectiveness at a concentration of 00123 however the concentration at which the drug can inhibit rdrp of sars-cov-2 remains to be determined while this may be predicted using quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar modeling studies in vitro in vivo and clinical studies would be required to ascertain the same in addition to remdesivir other known nucleoside analogs including sofosbuvir ribavirin penciclovir ganciclovir and favipiravir were found to interact with the active site of rdrp of sars-cov-2 fig 1a with high affinities table 1 our findings are in compliance with the study of elfiky5 who reported ribavirin remdesivir sofosbuvir galidesivir and tenofovir as effective inhibitors of sars-cov-2 rdrp using molecular modeling in the present study sofosbuvir was also found to be a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ribavirin an fda-approved synthetic guanosine nucleoside is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov and hcv26 27 28 penciclovir is also a synthetic nucleoside analog  acyclic guanine derivative which has been reported to be effective against herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus29 ganciclovir is also an approved nucleoside analog and effective against hiv30 favipiravir is an investigational nucleoside analog and inhibitor of rdrp and has been reported to be effective against ebola and influenza a h1n1 viruses31 32 33 however the major limitation of the present study is that we have not predicted the inhibitory concentrations of the compounds and thus it is suggested that qsar modeling studies are performed to determine the same furthermore we recommend that in vitro and in vivo studies are performed to first ascertain the effectiveness of the compounds on sars-cov-2 before proceeding to clinical studies the present study reports relative efficacy of 30 compounds in interacting with the active site of rdrp of sars-cov-2 in vitro studies and molecular modeling approaches have indicated that some of the broad-spectrum antivirals including remdesivir can be effective therapeutics against the virus while we report chlorhexidine to be the best inhibitor remdesivir was found to be the most potent among known antivirals nucleoside analogs such as remdesivir mimic the natural substrates of the rdrp and consequently bring about chain termination however other compounds including chlorhexidine are predicted to physically block the active site of the enzyme and thereby affect its activity while clinical trials with remdesivir are ongoing it is recommended that clinical trials be initiated with chlorhexidine and other antivirals to determine their effectiveness against covid-19 thus the present study is of immense significance in the therapeutic intervention against covid-19 the authors have none to declare  drug repurposing for coronavirus covid-19 in silico screening of known drugs against coronavirus 3cl hydrolase and protease enzymes ammar elmezayen d anas al-obaidi alp ahin tegin kemal yeleki   coronavirus disease covid-19 has become an important public issue across the globe since december 2019 as of 12th of april 2020 more than 179 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories worldometer 2020 it affects people worldwide and there is no vaccine yet for this virus certain types of pneumonia are implicated to the new coronavirus which is considered a big threat to global public health there is an urgent need to develop potent anti-covid-19 agents for the prevention of the outbreak and stop viral infections repurposing of known small molecules seems to be very efficient way in order to develop potent drugs to combat coronavirus in this short time period recently a number of efforts were made to design novel inhibitors or employ drug repurposing approach to identify anti-covid-19 drugs which can act as promising inhibitors against coronavirus protease khan et al 2020 sarma et al 2020 the known coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro also known as mpro is the main protease which is required for proteolytic maturation of the corona virus this mpro have an essential role in the immune regulation and cleaving the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which making them attractive and important targets for anti-covid-19 drugs zhou et al 2019 functional proteins such as rna polymerase endoribonuclease and exoribonuclease are generated by cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins by mpro khan et al 2020 therefore targeting mpro enzyme will inhibit the viral maturation and enhance the host innate immune response against covid-19 3d crystal structure of 3cl hydrolase from specific coronavirus pdb id 6lu7 is recently reported in the public domain this could be an excellent target to be used to screen small molecule libraries to inhibit the cleavage of the viral polyprotein and stop the spread of infection in the protein data bank pdb archive there are also some proteins whose sequence identity at least 90 similar to the covid-19 coronavirus 3cl hydrolase mpro these proteins structures include bound inhibitors which could lead to repurpose novel drug against coronavirus 3cl hydrolase recent study has shown that the cellular transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 is used by covid-19 for the purpose of entering the host cells and blocking tmprss2 might offer a promising treatment option and prevent the virus from entering the host cells hoffmann et al 2020 transmembrane serine proteases are connected to some viral respiratory infections where they facilitate the entry of the virus into the lungs shulla et al 2011 tmprss2 belongs to the serine protease transmembrane family type ii and it was recognized by its involvement in the cleavage of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein in epithelial cells bttcher et al 2006 in addition studies have shown that tmprss2 can drive the cleavage spike protein which is a coronavirus fusion glycoprotein spike proteins on the host cell surface are activated by tmprss2 to facilitate the virus cell-membrane fusion and the entry of the virus gierer et al 2013 matsuyama et al 2010 targeting tmprss2 in some animal studies decreased the pathological severity of influenza virus infection iwata-yoshikawa et al 2019 hence tmprss2 is an attractive target for designing and developing antiviral drugs laporte  naesens 2017 herein our study aims to help in coronavirus inhibition in one of two ways preventing the virus from entering the host cells and blocking the virus maturation inside the host cells computer-aided drug design cadd has been used for the identification of potent inhibitors against coronavirus berry et al 2015 oany et al 2014 in this study we have applied virtual screening approach homology modeling of human tmprss2 enzyme molecular docking study and admet profile analysis in order to identify novel and potential inhibitors against covid-19 figure 1 the recent resolved crystal structure of 3cl hydrolase enzyme was retrieved from the protein data bank pdb id 6lu7 with a resolution of 216  the enzyme has one chain with a total of 306 amino acids the enzyme was prepared at physiological ph 74 using prepare protein protocol in biovia discovery studio 45 ds 45 and missing residues insertion was allowed if found water molecules and the inhibitor were removed from the structure for the purpose of repurposing of known inhibitors a total of 4500 approved drugs were downloaded in sdf file format from chembl httpswwwebiacukchembl drugbank httpswwwdrugbankca and selleckchem httpswwwselleckchemcom

geometry was minimized using ds 45 lack of information of crystal structures of particular proteins has delayed and obstructed the drug industry homology modeling is widely applied to create a reliable structure of a protein using its own amino acid sequence vyas et al 2012 to date tmprss2 enzyme structure has not been resolved yet therefore basic local alignment search tool blast httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi search was carried out to identify the most suitable template for our target tmprss2 according to the results the crystal structure of human transmembrane protease serine desc1 showed high identity of 41 187 bit-score and 255333e-55 e-value with the query target consequently the 3d structure of desc1 was retrieved from pdb website pdb id 2oq5 161  kyrieleis et al 2007 tmprss2 sequence in fasta file format uniprot id o15393 was downloaded from uniprot httpwwwuniprotorg the template and the target sequences were aligned using align sequences in ds 45 twenty models were created using homology modeling protocol in ds 45 using modeller plug-in webb  sali 2016 modeller was then used to verify the 20 built models the best model was found to be m0001 with a normalized dope score of 1106201 the created homology modeling was then minimized using the clean geometry tool provided by ds 45 which minimizes the energy under charmm forcefield additionally the protein was prepared using prepare protein protocol and protonated at ph 74 m0001 model was then refined using 3drefine web server httpsysbiornetmissouriedu3drefine bhattacharya et al 2016 further verification of our homology modeling was carried out using web-based tools prosa wiederstein  sippl 2007 procheck laskowski et al 1993 and errat colovos  yeates 1993 to assess the quality of the model structure structure-based virtual screening refers to in silico identification of potential chemical molecules out of large number of compound libraries which have high affinity to proteins of known structure based on the binding of the small molecule with the protein binding pocket sliwoski et al 2014 to perform the virtual screening approach in our study autodock vina was used autodock vina offers an accurate and high performance docking tool which relies on both empirical and knowledge-based scoring functions trott  olson 2009 the docking parameters for both mpro and tmprss2 are given in table 1 autodock vina was used to assess the binding affinity of the native inhibitor n3 obtained from the crystal structure of mpro as well as the binding affinity of selected known inhibitors of tmprss2 retrieved from the literature sielaff et al 2011 the binding energy threshold was based on the average binding energy scores of docked known inhibitors against mpro and tmprss2 which found to be 62 kcalmol and 72 kcalmol respectively in the present study the threshold was set to 8 kcalmol due to the fact that hit compounds were expected to show lower binding energy scores and to narrow down the search space selection criterion was set to ensure that the virtual screening will end up only with those molecules with the highest binding affinities to their respective targets a total of 3451 molecules satisfied our selection criterion g  8 kcalmol and showed the highest binding affinity against mpro and tmprss2 enzymes respectively the hits compound from the virtual screening study were further docked into the studied targets using autodock 42 morris et al 2009 grid box mapping parameters are shown in table 2 grid box parameters were set to cover the whole binding pocket and its adjacent residues twenty million energy evaluations were performed for each compound with a total of twenty runs using autodock 42 lamarckian genetic algorithm was used and gasteiger partial charges were added onto all studied proteins electrostatic potential was predicted using delphi program included in ds 45 which employs the poisson-boltzmann formula on a cubic lattice using the finite-difference technique to calculate the electrostatic charge distribution of tmprss2 and mpro enzymes nicholls  honig 1991 absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity admet profile has a great importance in drug industry and is widely used in cadd to reduce undesired effects in our study web-based tools admetsar yang et al 2019 and swissadme daina et al

 in the present study mm-pbsa calculations were performed using calculation of free energy cafe tool to calculate the interaction energy between the ligand and the residues of the protein active site liu  hou 2016 in the mm-pbsa calculations the external dielectric constant was set to 800 the internal dielectric constant was 10 and the reciprocal of grid spacing of 10  was employed out of the 20 models generated by modeller we selected model m0001 which had the lowest normalized dope score 1106201 sequence alignment for m0001 and the human desc1were performed unsing ds 45 and the sequence identity was 394 while sequence similarity was 61 figure 2 in fact if the target and template sequences share 30 and more of amino acid identity the homology modeling is considered to be reliable and successful xiang 2006 structural alignment of our homology modeling structure target with the 3 d structure of desc1 template was performed using ds 45 and the calculated rmsd was 040  which suggests the high similarity between the target and the template figure 3 our model m0001 was verified using the web-based version of protein structure analysis tool prosa prosa is used to calculate the z-score of a specific model and correlate this score to those calculated scores from all publicly available structures on pdb website accordingly the z-score of our model m0001 was -669 which is in the range of all pdb conformations figure 4a moreover the energy plot describes amino acid position depending on its local energy where negative values relate to the accuracy of the structure figure

enzyme in comparison to talampicillin and lurasidone and this explains the higher binding affinity estimated for the mpro enzyme figures 6 and 7 rubitecan drug bound to our model with a binding energy value of 947 kcalmol and an inhibition constant of 11506 nm rubitecan is a potent antitumor drug and has a high potency against solid tumors and pancreatic cancer clark 2006 the nitroso group no of

and on those interactions between them electrostatic charges were mapped on our homology modeling tmprss2 and the coronavirus protease mpro for better understanding the surface nature of both enzymes intensity of positive potential was found to cover the binding pocket of the protease mpro figure 9a b the inner cavity of the binding pocket of the tmprss2 model was found to have a negative potential and the rest of the active site is covered by positive charge figure 9c d lipinskis rule of 5 was used to predict the drug-likeness of our hits from the zinc15 library lipinskis rule of 5 states that for any ligand to be considered as a drug-like a molecule should obey these criteria molecular weight 500 dalton number of h-bond donors 5 number of h-bond acceptors 10 and logp 5 lipinski 2004 accordingly all of our hits obeyed this rule and thus considered as drug-like compounds furthermore our compounds were found to be within the reference range considering their water solubility logs caco-2 permeability and topological polar surface area tpsa table 4 in present study to evaluate the stability of the homology model and the drug candidates these structures were subjected to md simulation root mean square deviation rmsd was calculated considering the proteins backbone with respect to the initial conformations as depicted in figure 10a rmsd of free mpro enzyme remained stable between 5 ns and 34 ns timescale at 24  then slightly increased and persisted at 36  from 35 ns till the end of the run the rmsd of mprozinc000015988935 reached its steady state at 31  at 10 ns the rmsd of mprotalampicillin showed that the system was balanced after 5 ns and slightly fluctuated between 23 and 3  and displayed the greatest effect on mpros stability as illustrated in figure 10b the rmsd curves of the free tmprss2 had reached the equilibrium state after 3 ns the rmsd of compounds tmprss2rubitecan and tmprss2zinc000000702323 revealed that the two complexes had shown almost the same behavior during the md simulation and achieved structural stability the last 15 ns a thorough study of the root mean square fluctuation rmsf curves of the free mpro and its complexes showed all amino acids located in the active site of the enzyme had rmsf fluctuations between 08  and 17  which indicate that the studied compounds kept close contact with their binding pockets during the md simulations however mprozinc000015988935 showed higher fluctuations for residues 4345 and 187190 and this observation is consistent with the rmsd profiles of mprozinc000015988935 figure 11a the higher fluctuations depicted in the rmsf profiles of tmprss2 and its complexes are located within the loop regions of the protein and this is expected considering the high flexibility nature of loops figure 11b the binding free energy mm-pbsa was computed after the md simulation the last 10 ns for all the complexes and the results are given in table 5 compound zinc000015988935 depicted the lowest binding

in comparison to compound zinc000000702323 mpro and tmprss2 are shown to be important and highly potent targets for the inhibition of covid-19 infection in this study the structure-based virtual screening identified four commercially available drugs talampicillin lurasidone rubitecan and loprazolam with a potential inhibition of mpro and tmprss2 enzymes these drugs might be repurposed against covid-19 in addition four novel compounds were identified from zinc15 library showed promising high affinities against mpro and tmprss2 enzymes these hits were described as drug-like compounds and showed harmless admet properties and may aid in developing and optimizing more efficient and potent covid-19 inhibitors trajectories analysis showed that the studied complexes have displayed structural stability during the md runs  identification of potential molecules against covid-19 main protease through structure-guided virtual screening approach lovika mittal anita kumari mitul srivastava mrityunjay singh shailendra asthana   the coronavirus covid-19 is a newly emerged human-infectious coronavirus cov pandemic and a global health emergency unfortunately at present there is no well-defined treatment or therapeutics against covid-19 is available but the preventive measures are being recommended worldwide however the clinical trials for already marketed drugs such as lopinavir ritonavir hydroxychloroquine azithromycin tirumalaraju 2020c chloroquine clinicaltrialsgov nd remdesivir tirumalaraju 2020b etc along with antibiotics are being evaluated to treat the secondary infections wwwclinicaltrialsgov all of the drug options come from experience treating sars mers or some other new influenza virus previously lu 2020 these drugs would be helpful but the efficacy needs to be further confirmed few covid-19 vaccines are also under clinical trials such as modernas mrna-1273 first us clinical vaccine funded by nihs niaid national institute of allergy and infectious diseases tirumalaraju 2020a thus there is an unmet requirement for the specific anti-covid-19 therapeutics to limit the severity of the deadly disease various clinicians and researchers are engaged in investigating and developing antivirals using different strategies combining experimental and in-silico approaches elfiky 2020 enayatkhani et al 2020 enmozhi et al 2020 islam et al 2020 jin et al 2020 khan jha et al 2020 khan zia et al 2020 qamar et al 2020 sinha et al 2020 with the goal of identifying novel selective and potent therapeutic agents an attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease mpro 3clpro due to its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral rna boopathi et al 2020 the present study focused on the main proteases in covs as potential target proteins for covid-19 treatment mpro3clpro is active in its dimer state but till now there is no crystal structure available for the dimer form its monomer inhabits the 306 amino acids including 3 domains folded into helices and -strands the electron density map for the monomer protein is clearly visible figure 1a the domain i residues 1101 and ii residues 102184 includes an antiparallel -barrel structure and domain iii residues 201303 includes five -helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular cluster and is connected to domain ii by means of a long loop region residues 185200 jin et al 2020 the catalytic dyad h41 and c145 is responsible for the catalytic activity of sars-cov-2 and is placed at the junction of domain i and domain ii figure 1a recently crystal structures for monomeric mpro in both apo pdb-id 6m03 and holo pdb-id 6lu7 bound with n3 inhibitor forms were crystallised the mpro of 2019-ncov shares 96 similarity with the mpro of the sars-cov qamar et al 2020 it is reported that 12 residues vary in both sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 but the residue s46 in sars-cov-2 covid-19 corresponding residue a46 in sars-cov-1 is part of the binding pocket of the n3 molecule or active site qamar et al 2020 another co-crystal pdb-id 6y2f6y2g -ketoamide inhibitor 13b is also reported recently providing the structural and residue-based architecture of catalytic sites zhang et al 2020 these co-crystals are paving the route for the application of virtual screening vs to get more efficacious molecules al-khafaji et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 lobo-galo et al 2020 knowledge gained from the previous outbreaks and existing antivirals gain attraction as the fastest route to fight the current coronavirus epidemic henceforth this emergency put drug repurposing on fast track drug repurposing approach is being widely applied to quickly identify therapeutic solutions due to availability of their pharmacokinetic toxicological and manufacturing data it includes drugs that are either fda approved investigational withdrawn or shelved compounds although there are studies of the repurposing and marketed drugs which proposed several candidates for sars-cov-2 treatment aanouz et al 2020 elmezayen et al 2020 pant et al 2020 with this aim we have first used molecular dynamics simulations to standardize our computational model specially focused on stable architecture of the binding site which was used for vs to eventually facilitate the rapid identification of potent molecules the findings from this study may provide an opportunity to explore these compounds for anti-covid-19 therapeutics the crystal structures apo 6m03 and com1 6lu7 were optimized and then minimized using the protein preparation wizard module of maestro anang et al 2018 maestro 2017 in which opls3 optimized potentials for liquid simulations force field was used jorgensen et al 1996 the sitemap sitemap 2017 program of schrodinger suite was also used for calculating binding sites on crystal 6lu7 the method was implemented as an unbiased approach to undermine the presence of any secondary or allosteric binding site sitemap which is a ligand independent method will also help in calculating the druggability of the identified site halgren 2009 mattapally et al 2018 srivastava et al 2018 thakur et al 2020 the opls-2005 force field jorgensen et al 1996 was employed and a standard grid was used with 15 site points per reported site and cropped at 40  from the nearest site point the ligand structures were taken from sellekchem database httpwwwselleckchemcom the drugbank database httpswwwdrugbankca and the repurposing hub httpsclueiorepurposing see supplementary figure 1 the ligands were prepared using schrdingers version 2017-1 ligprep ligprep 2017 the optimization was done using the opls3 force field jorgensen et al 1996 the known pharmacological activity of the hits were curated from the above-mentioned databases along with the pubchem database httpspubchemncbinlmnihgov the apo of mpro pdb-id 6m03 along with com1 and com2 docked 13b pose in mpro monomer were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation for 200 ns using desmond v36 module from schrodinger suite bowers et al 2006 in addition we also performed short simulation of hits molecules to observe their stability and its impact on protein the systems were built via systems builder using opls3 force field and solvated with tip3p water solvent model all the complexes were placed in the orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions with a size of repeating buffered units at 10  counter ions were also added to neutralize the systems an energy minimisation step was done for each system using a steepest descent integrator for 2000 steps the npt ensemble was employed for the simulations with the nose-hover chain thermostat and the martyna-tobias-klein barostat respa integrator was used with a time step of 0002ps for short range coulombic interactions a 90  cut-off was considered bonds to hydrogen were constrained using the mshake algorithm of desmond the coordinates were saved at intervals of 20 ps that are referred to as frames in this study the site of bound peptide n3 was chosen as primary site for ligand docking which is also confirmed by sitemap as the most druggable site the grid was generated using the centroid of n3 by using the receptor grid generation panel in glide docking studies were carried out using the vs workflow vsw of glide schrodinger suite friesner et al 2006 mittal et al 2020the ligands chosen from the database were passed through three stages of the screening workflow starting from high-throughput screening 50 filtered followed by standard precision 30 and finally extra precision 10 stages the final poses were processed using the prime mm-gbsa panel at the end schrodinger suite llc new york ny 2016-3 supplementary figure 1 the control molecules n3 and 13b were also docked on the same grid the results of the docking were then quantified on the basis of docking scores and mm-gbsa gbind the pharmacokinetic properties of the molecules were evaluated by swissadme server daina et al 2017 joshi et al 2020 also the top filtered compounds were further cross-checked their stability through md simulations as mentioned earlier the average binding energy was calculated for equilibrated md trajectory the binding energy was calculated by
gbindemm gsolv gsa
where the difference in the minimized energies between ligand and protein complexes is denoted by emm gsolv is the difference in the gbsa solvation energy of the complexes and sum of solvation energies for the protein and ligand whereas the differences in surface area energy of the complex and sum of that in protein and ligand kellici et al 2019 mittal et al 2020 all the images were generated using vmd and schrodinger suite asthana et al 2014 2015 humphrey et al 1996 and graphs were plotted using xmgrace mittal et al 2019 turner 2005 the availability of co-crystal 6lu7 in which a peptide n3 a covalently-bonded inhibitor is bound and knowledge of interacting residues with molecule 13b -ketoamide inhibitor made the understanding of protein interesting since the residues reported for compound 13b involve the same residues as for n3 molecules zhang et al 2020 therefore monomer crystals were used for further analysis the architecture of binding site with any possible conformational changes was concurred after superimposition of the crystal structures com1 and apo it shows that overall structure of protein is well aligned rmsd apo-vs-com1 is 04  except c-terminal region figure 1b we also observed some noticeable differences in the binding site architecture of com1 and apo figure 1c it was found that all the residues of the binding site are well aligned with that of apo except the residues t25 m49 m165 r188 q189 and t190 that shows their side chain conformational changes while p168 shows the backbone movement also figure 1c the inhibitor forms the hydrogen bond hb interactions with residues g143 h163 e166 q189 and t190 to bring in more robustness in confirming the final binding site before performing the vs we performed ligand independent binding site search on mpro the top score of the sitemap program also confirms the co-crystal site as the primary binding site marked as site 1 with the highest dscore of 109 best druggability score figure 2 and table 1 the volume of the pocket is 28709 3 this binding site of mpro is encompassed by domain i and ii and the loop region connecting domains ii and iii sitemap result shows that this pocket is relatively smaller in size with a size score of 120 reference value 130 and more exposed to solvent with an exposure value of 0614 reference value 052 halgren 2009 furthermore we performed the focused docking on the site 1 with the n3 and 13b molecules to set up the benchmark for vs execution based on two main criteria ie docking score and mm-gbsa values the docking score and mm-gbsa values for n3 com1 is 106 kcalmol and 6432 kcalmol respectively while for 13b com2 it is 666 kcalmol and 6326 kcalmol respectively table 2 we performed md simulations for both apo and com proteins for stability of the systems with respect to time evolution the rmsd root mean square deviation plot for apo-vs-com1 systems showed that apo protein is stable after 20 ns simulation while com1 attains stability after 50 ns of simulation figure 3a we observed a sudden deviation in the com1 system that started around 35ns and lasted till 55ns this increase in deviation is mainly attributed to extended loop conformation residue 185 to 200 which is flexible in nature the apo-vs-com2 system showed that both the systems are stable throughout the trajectory with considerably minor deviations figure 3b the radius of gyration rg of the simulated systems also showed that all the systems have attained compactness figure 3c to explore the fluctuations of the systems residue wise the rmsf root mean square fluctuation analysis was carried out from the rmsf plots we observed that binding of n3 made mpro protein more flexible especially in the domain iii as compared to 13b figure 3de since domain iii is involved to form a homodimer so this might be the reason for fluctuation in this region in the presence of ligands the ligand rmsd plots showed that they are stable during the dynamics the atoms ranging from 1 to 8 and 40 to 49 of n3 molecules are observed to be highly fluctuated rmsf  10  while all the atoms of 13b are observed with rmsf  10  especially atoms 3943 figure 4 this suggests that the flexible atoms of the ligands can be replaced by another atom or group of atoms which may restrict its movement in the pocket and ability to increase the potency that inhibit the mpro with optimum efficiency in case of com2 the highest fluctuation is observed for e290 that is responsible for dimer formation of the mpro by salt-bridge interactions between e290 of one monomer and r4 of the other zhang et al 2020 the binding site rmsd of systems apo com1 and com2 are very stable which signifies that residues are undergoing least conformational changes figure 3f also in comparison to apo inhibitor n3 com1 has induced more stability in the binding site as compared to inhibitor 13b com2 however it can be noted that there is slight deviation in rmsd of com1 and com2 by the convergence of simulation figure 3f from the md analysis it is very well evident that the binding site is well compact and the most stable state was extracted for the vs purpose the analysis of stable protein-ligand interactions and the contribution of a particular residue towards the ligand binding in the pocket is an important aspect to identify the hot-spots from the md simulation of com1 the residues t26 g143 c145 q189 and t190 are observed to be involved in hb formation for more than 60 occupancy of the simulation time figure 5a the residue h41 is observed to form water mediated interaction with the ligand for 56 of the simulation time the residues n119 s144 q189 t190 and q192 also form transient water mediated interactions in the com2 the residues e166 and t190 are highly involved in the hb stability for more than 60 of their occupancy figure 5b residue e166 is also involved in transient water mediated and salt bridge interactions the residues h41 c145 h164 and q189 also establish water mediated interactions for certain time during the simulation time the hydrophobic contributions by residues h41 m49 and p168 were observed however its occupancy is less than 40 in the simulation time our md simulations shows that the pocket is hydrophilic in nature but there is no stable water molecule involved during the dynamics the binding site sasa solvent accessible surface area shows that apo protein is quite more solvent exposed than both the complexes figure 3g the residues c145 q189 and t190 are the common key residues that are observed from the protein-ligand interactions occupancy plots from the overall analysis of md simulation we conclude two main aspects 1 we obtained the stable computational model com1 as it is showing the intact binding site with minor conformational changes and 2 the insights of the binding pocket where hot-spot residues and their respective interactions were elucidated qualitatively and quantitatively both aspects were applied for vs of the library it has been a proven and successful strategy to inhibit the viral proteases for the treatment of viral infections such as in the cases of human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv and hence screening of protease inhibitors could be a useful approach against covid-19 mpro ghosh et al 2016 yang et al 2006 with this logic 227 protease molecules from selleckchem were curated and prepared for screening on site1 based on our filtering criteria of optimum mm-gbsa and docking scores the top 30 initial hits were filtered out figure 6a the docking scores mm-gbsa pharmacokinetic descriptors their known targets along with the structures of the hits are shown in table 2 other than the quantitative parameters docking score and mm-gbsa energy the additional qualitative parameters were chosen to screen the docked conformations which show similar interaction patterns and interactions with respect to controls however some of these molecules including our control molecules n3 and 13b violate the few pharmacokinetic properties but they can be used as immediate starting point for the experimental validation and optimization as per their potency and efficacy that can facilitate the identification of more potent drug-like molecules for all selected molecules top hits the residue mapping based on interaction pattern was executed figure 7 the top three molecules found in our study are leupeptin hemisulfate pepstatin a and nelfinavir on the basis of mm-gbsa and docking scores and their ligand interaction diagrams are shown in figure 8ac respectively however few of the molecules are observed to be common in our screening and some in-silico studies published targeting mpro and they are nelfinavir lopinavir indinavir ritonavir darunavir das et al 2020 khan zia et al 2020 muralidharan et al 2020 nutho et al 2020 highlighted in cyan colour table 2 another library of fdarepurposing molecule curated from different sources such as repurposing hub selleckchem and drugbank were used to prepare for screening purpose due to high failure rates considerable costs and slow pace of new drug discovery and development re-use of old drugs to treat diseases becomes the quickest route to find the active molecules as it requires the use of known bioactive moleculeswith potentially lower production costs and shorter timelines pushpakom et al 2019 from the multi-step route of vs we filtered out the best 41 hits figure 6b the docking scores mm-gbsa pharmacokinetic descriptors their known targets along with the structures of the hits are shown in table 3 and their residue wise interaction mapping is also carried out figure 9 from this library the best three molecules are birinapant lypressin and octreotide and their ligand interaction diagrams are shown in figure 10ac respectively nevertheless these molecules violate the pharmacokinetic properties but could be optimised to drug-like properties based on the experimental results the finding of some common top molecules in this study are also reported in other screening studies on the same target claiming the robustness of our protocols these common molecules are lypressin octreotide mitoxantrone hesperidin echanoside pralmorelin epicatechin diosmin flavitan flavin adenine dinucleotide curcumin saquinavir montelukast baicalin thymopentin das et al 2020 highlighted in cyan colour table 3 the residues that have shown the highest occupancy 90 are re-analysed the residues h41 m49 n142 c145 h164 m165 e166 d187 r188 and q189 for all the hits obtained from protease library figure 7 with respect to the control compounds n3 and 13b the residues g143 e166 and q189 are observed to be majorly involved in hbs interactions for most of the hits while h41 is observed to form pi-pi stacking and pi-cation interaction in some cases figure 7 similarly for the hits obtained from fdarepurpose library the residue interaction mapping showed that the residues h41 m49 n142 c145 m165 e166 r188 and q189 have higher occupancy 90 in the binding site figure 9 the hbs analysis found that residues t26 g143 e166 and q189 are highly involved in the hb interactions figure 9 from the residue interaction mapping analysis of hits we observed that the binding site of mpro is composed of 447 of polar residues 421 of non-polar residues 105 of acidic residues and 26 of basic residues which encompasses a diverse class of molecules this indicates that the binding site site1 of mpro is hydrophilic in nature and solvent exposed which is in concordance with our site map results however the flexibility and adaptability of the pocket towards the ligand explored by molecular dynamics simulation matches nicely with the previous findings also we find h41 m49 n142 c145 h164 m165 e166 and q189 are the most conserved residues and their high occupancy in all our top hits as reported by wang 2020 that mers sars and covid-19 have four h41 h163 m165 and q189 common residues while hcv ns34a and covid-19 have only one common hotspot residue h41 confirming our findings that the hits having interaction with these residues might have broad spectrum value we identified six molecules with a lower free energy of binding combined with a higher theoretical drug discovery value compared to the co-crystallized ligand n3 and 13b figure 11 the md analysis of top molecules highlight that nelfinavir and birinapant have granted maximum stability to protein throughout simulation as compared to other four selected hits supplementary figure 2 however the other four hits were also found to be stable which is well reflected in the result supplementary figure 2 the mm-gbsa calculations from the equilibrated md trajectories of the hits and control molecules showed that all the hits except for leupeptin hemisulfate has shown considerably better binding energy than the control molecules supplementary table 1 some molecules have shown a minor decrease in their binding energies also some of them have presented a substantial improvement in comparison to the co-crystallized ligand we observed that their docking scores ranging from 70 to 90 kcalmol however some of our molecules have shown substantially good docking energy as well as their free energy is also considerably higher side which is consistent and reflected well through md simulations our identified hits interacted with the protease with at least two hbs with an average of over four figures 8 and 10 appearing as the hot-spot residues whose knowledge is critical for structure-based hits identification furthermore the identified molecules have shown relevant pharmacokinetic descriptors with logp values mw psa and hb donorsacceptors in the range described by lipinski though there are many approved and successful drugs which are documented of not following the standard lipinski rule especially for protein-protein interactions disruptors it is also encouraging that the identified hits are available at commercial suppliers such as mcule and selleckchem the identified top six molecules presented comparatively better docking and post-processing md simulation analysis of free energy ie mm-gbsa scores with respect to the control molecules and therefore represent excellent candidates for further investigation in-vitro figure 11 from the overall analysis the identified set of molecules can be considered as early hit molecules albeit we accept that no experimentally supported hit-optimization was conducted though these molecules looks promising as the cases increase day by day there is an extremely urgent need of the designing small compound or peptide drugs to cure the 2019-ncov based on crystal structures and md simulations a computational model of mpro was chosen for vs it is an important step before performing vs as it not only highlights the dynamical changes in the pocket which should be taken in account for reducing false-positives results but also highlight the overall impact of binding of the compounds on the protein thereafter interaction fingerprinting of binding sitesof static from crystals-vs-dynamic from md simulations changes a structure-based vs of known and existing molecule libraries were performed to identify the potential molecules that possibly repurposed against mpro a high-resolution crystal structure of covid-19 mpro in complex with n3 and knowledge of key residues from 13b molecules is available on time allowing us to conduct drug repurposing through md simulations we have observed and quantified the dynamical changes and nature of the binding site at residue level the investigation of solvation sites or the role of water molecules in the binding site could be carried out to explore the druggability of this pocket that might help in rational designing of molecules the comparative analysis of identified hits with n3 and 13b further supports our findings the knowledge of interactions in terms of hbs hydrophobic contacts salt-bridges and pi-pi stacking and their conformations was considered exclusively for filtering of the molecules other than quantitative values such as dscore docking and g of the complexes currently antineoplastic immunomodulators nucleotide inhibitors antimalarial ribonucleoside inhibitors steroid hormones protease inhibitors antiretrovirals are being evaluated in clinical trials against covid-19 we identified similar category of molecules in our vs approach the hits found in our study belongs to different chemical classes and have the potential to accommodate inside the pocket that can be further quickly explored by antiviral experimental assays for binding affinity and inhibition activity there will be no prior need for synthesis of these molecules as they are easily available and these predicted hits or their scaffolds can be a good starting point for developing novel hits if confirmed in in-vitro studies the potential hits listed in this study are promising candidates and can facilitate the hunt of anti-covid-19 mpro drug discovery  virtual drug repurposing study against sars-cov-2 tmprss2 target serdar durdai   coronaviruses covs belong to a single-stranded rna positive-sense virus family which is encapsulated by a membrane envelope durdagi et al 2020 there are 4 common types of coronavirus alpha beta gamma and delta and cause mild upper respiratory tract diseases mckee et al 2020 human beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic zhang et al 2020 the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome-cov was appeared in guangdong in china and infected 8096 people worldwide in 20022003 the fatality rate was around 10 ie 774 deaths in 2012 the mers middle east respiratory syndrome-cov infected about 2500 people and the fatality rate was 36 blanco-melo et al 2020 currently the world suffers from a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 that causes 2019 coronavirus disease covid-19 like sars and mers-covs sars-cov-2 mainly affects the lower respiratory tract blanco-melo et al 2020 it is characterized by a number of symptoms such as fever cough diarrhoea and general weakness blanco-melo et al 2020 in more serious cases it causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung damage leading to inflammation and pneumonia on the 11th of march 2020 the who declared the covid-19 as a pandemic hoffmann et al 2020 it affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people as a result of compulsory isolation and quarantines in the world sanders et al 2020 sars-cov-2 targets host cells via spike protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor the virus then uses host cell receptors ie type 2 transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 and endosomes to enter the cells tmprss2 facilitates cell entry of sars-cov-2 through the spike protein after entering the host cell viral proteins are synthesized that encode for the replicase-transcriptase complex mousavizadeh and ghasemi 2020 viral rna was then synthesized by rna-dependent rna polymerase durdagi et al 2020 the genome of sars-cov-2 encodes for different structural and nonstructural proteins sanders et al 2020 the important ones for drug development studies are main protease and rna-dependent rna polymerase cao et al 2020 currently these proteins are mainly targeted for drug screening and drug repurposing studies  it is noteworthy that the method known as drug repurposing has become less costly in terms of both time and resources in our laboratory the use of molecules in different indications has been investigated with the studies we have done in this field in recent years durdagi et al 2018 is et al2018 tutumlu et al 2020 since the most of the preclinic and clinical studies including pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies of approved or compounds in clinical investigation phases have been already tested they require less time to make them suitable for new indications the toxicity and adme absorption distribution metabolism and excretion studies which need long time to complete are not required as the molecules considered in drug repositioning pass these stages already that should be applied before and have well-defined profiles therefore their use in epidemics is more suitable than new molecules that have never been tested hence in the current study we performed a virtual drug repurposing study the small molecules from ncgc-nih chemical genomics center pharmaceutical collection ie npc library were used in virtual screening studies at the active site of developed tmprss2 model target protein we downloaded and prepared 7922 small compounds from npc library httpstripodnihgovnpc before the virtual screening to remove nonspecific compounds we performed some filtration criteria such as molecular weights of compounds which are more than 1000 gmol and smaller than 100 gmol were removed from the library the compounds that have more than 100 rotatable bonds or hydrogen bond acceptor and donor number that is higher than 10 were also removed thus the total number of molecules were decreased to 6654 before the docking simulations these compounds were prepared with ligprep module ligprep schrodinger v2017 of maestro molecular modeling package since the crystal structure of the tmprss2 was not available we performed homology modeling study swiss model was used in homology modeling study swissmodelexpasyorg the 5ce1 pbb coded serine protease hepsin was used as template structure sequence identity between template and target proteins was 352 structural assessment studies on the developed model have been performed there was no residue at the unfavourable region at the ramachandrans plot and protein reports showed no steric clashes bond length or bond angle deviations at the structure thus it was suitable to use as target protein supplementary materials figure s1 before the docking modelled target protein was prepared using protein preparation module of maestro molecular modeling package in the determination of protonation states of residues at the target protein propka was used a restrained optimization protocol was employed with opls3e force field for the target protein model using 03  convergence criteria docking was implemented with standard precision sp protocol of glide using default settings for the top-50 docking poses all-atom molecular dynamics md simulations were performed to mimic physiological conditions using desmond orthorhombic box was used with explicit water models ie tip3p that have 10  thickness from the edges of the protein 015 m nacl was added to the simulation box to neutralize the system the particle mesh ewald method was used for long range electrostatic interactions 90  cut-off was used for both electrostatic and van der waals interactions the temperature 310 k and pressure 101325 bar throughout the simulations were kept constant by nose-hoover thermostat evans and holian 1985 and martyna-tobias-klein barostat martyna et al 1994 the opls3e force field was used in md simulations 1000 trajectory frames for each system during the simulations were collected molecular mechanics generalized born surface area mmgbsa method was then employed for these trajectories and average mmgbsa score for each studied compound was computed the vsgb 20 solvation model in prime module of maestro was employed in mmgbsa calculations  nowadays thanks to the effort of nih chemical genomics center it is possible to obtain electronic resources of collections of small molecules that have been registered combining this with the power of recent advances of ligand- and target-driven based virtual screening methods it has been made easier to consider drug repurposing for any disease especially for complex diseases we used homology model target tmprss2 structure and screened the prepared 6654 fda approved drugs and compounds in clinical investigation phases from npc database using glidesp docking scores were between 8445 and 3438 kcalmol figure s2 due to the limited flexibility of both the target protein and the screened ligands in docking the identification of the compounds based on only docking scores in docking simulations can lead to false-positive results tutumlu et al 2020 moreover although molecular docking simulations may provide an insight into proteinscreened ligand interactions it is always important to understand how these interactions are sustained throughout the performing md simulations thus we used top-50 docking scored compounds and employed initially short 10-ns all-atom md simulations in physiological and body temperature conditions docking scores of top 50 compounds were between 8445 and 6962 kcalmol see figure 1 and table at the supplementary materials an in-house script was used to prepare simulation boxes and analyse md simulations desmond was used in all md simulations table represents the average mmgbsa scores using the recorded 1000 frames strided by 10 during the simulations in each system of the top-50 ligands in order to compare the docking scores and average mmgbsa scores of identified hit compounds through our virtual screening protocol we also used same screening protocol for a well-known tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate it is an approved small molecule compound for the treatment of pancreatitis in japan it is found that camostat mesylate prevents sars-cov-2 cell entry by inhibition of host serine protease tmprss2 its docking score was 5444 kcalmol at the binding pocket of the tmprss2 its corresponding average mmgbsa score was calculated as 65514 kcalmol figure s3 at the supplementary materials shows 2d ligand interactions diagram of camostat mesylate at the binding site of sars-cov-2 tmprss2 target crucial residues were found as val280 asp435 ser436 gln438 gly439 ser441 ser460 and val473 based on average mmgbsa scores of short md simulations we selected 3 hits that have better scores than 700 kcalmol which are benzquercin difebarbamate and n-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-paba long 100-ns md simulations were performed for these compounds and mmgbsa scores were recalculated results showed that benzquercin n-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-paba and difebarbamate have average mmgbsa scores of 80583 56162 and 66567 kcalmol respectively results showed that especially benzquercin a flavonoid has maintained the interactions with the binding pocket residues although average mmgbsa score of difebarbamate is slightly decreased at the long md simulations compared to short simulation it has still similar range of mmgbsa score with positive control compound camostat figure 2 represents the 2d and 3d ligand interactions diagram of benzquercin at the binding site of tmprss2 the last frame from 100-ns md simulations was used crucial residues at the target were found as his296 glu299 pro301 leu302 lys340 lys342 gly439 and ser441 which share similar binding pocket residues with positive control camostat based on interaction fractions analysis lys342 has the highest interaction fraction value with the hit compound throughout the 100-ns simulations the type of main interactions between the ligand and binding pocket residues were hydrogen bonds through water bridges and hydrophobic interactions  interestingly benzquercin was also found as potent hit compounds in our previous virtual screening study using same protocol against another important cell-entry target of sars-cov-2 spikeace2 durdagi et al 2020 its average score at the spikeace2 interface was found as 70810 kcalmol hence these studies showed that benzquercin may also act as dual inhibitor it has been recognized that the treatment of one targetone molecule approach of complex diseases is not so effective the usage of combined drugs is not also appreciated due to toxicity andor undesirable drug-drug interactions the recent and promising approach to these complex diseases including covid-19 is instead to developidentify unique compounds that act on multi-targets simultaneously which these targets are crucial in the studied disease thus based on in silico results benzquercin has this potential molecular modeling studies such as virtual screening reduce the time required to set new targets for known drugs and also provide the advantage of being cost-effective shoichet et al 2002 durdagi et al 2018 and 2020 in this study a virtual drug repurposing study was performed to identify new compounds against tmprss2 which is an important target for the entry of the sars-cov-2 to the host cell thus npc small molecule library was screened initially by docking simulations based on docking scores top-50 compounds were used in short md simulations and their average binding free energies were calculated by mmgbsa method selected hits were used in longer md simulations and results showed that especially benzquercin maintains its interactions with the crucial residues throughout the simulations if these results can be validated by experimental studies benzquercin can be considered to be used as inhibitor of tmprss2 at the clinical studies this study was supported by baheehir university scientific research projects unit project no bap2020-0101  analysis of infected host gene expression reveals repurposed drug candidates and time-dependent host response dynamics for covid-19 jing xing rama shankar aleksandra drelich shreya paithankar evgenii chekalin thomas dexheimer mei-sze chua surender rajasekaran chien-te tseng kent bin chen   since early december 2019 the newly emerged sars-cov-2 has infected more than 4 million people globally covid-19 report from who nd in the united states confirmed cases increased exponentially and steadily exceeding the million mark within two months making the united states the hardest hit country globally cdc cases and updates nd among all infected patients approximately 16 suffered from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and approximately 6 died from acute respiratory failure acute cardiac injury secondary infection and other serious complications covid-19 report from who nd huang et al 2020 as this highly contagious and pathogenic virus spread rapidly throughout the world the who declared it a pandemic named covid-19 and effective therapeutics are urgently needed repurposing existing drugs could be an efficient and timely means of identifying novel drugs for treating this disease initially repurposed drugs such as lopinavirritonavir baricitinib remdesivir and chloroquine were investigated for clinical efficacy in covid-19 patients peeri et al 2020 wang et al 2020 remdesivir has since shown encouraging efficacy and is currently used as a benchmark drug for treating covid-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms these repurposed drugs under study are hypothesized to target key steps of viral entry or specific proteins involved in viral replication including viral proteases zumla et al 2016 in addition to viral replication the viral pathogen associated molecular pattern pamp eg immune dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress figure 1a could be targeted to improve clinical outcomes de wit et al 2016 pamps-mediated signaling pathways are attractive drug targets in diseases caused by human pathogens therefore effectively targeting these pathways to stop the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by sars-cov-2 might potentially reduce the morbidities and mortalities associated with this virus independent of sars-cov-2 infection in aging adult populations ards is associated with mortality rates of 3050 bellani et al 2016 thus a methodical and unbiased search for new drug candidates from a large drug library could uncover drugs that have the potential to arrest the infection and ameliorate its debilitating effects we aim to accomplish this by analyzing infection-induced gene expressions in the host cells we and others b chen wei et al 2017 lee et al 2017 van noort et al 2014 pessetto et al 2016 qu and rajpal 2012 sirota et al 2011 h wu et al 2017 have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cell lines to discover new therapeutic candidates for diseases the central idea is to identify drugs that reverse the disease gene expression signature by suppressing the over-expressed disease genes and activating the repressed genes figure 1a a disease signature is defined as a list of differentially expressed genes between disease samples and normal control samples we recently established a scoring system for the reversal of gene expression named summarized reversal of gene expression score srges that correlates with drug efficacy in cancers b chen ma et al 2017 demonstrating the feasibility of applying this approach to predict drug candidates for other diseases including covid-19 and other viral infections to utilize srges for drug discovery in sars-cov-2 we first needed to collect sars-cov-2-induced host gene expression profiles which were not available at the time of writing given the high genomic similarity of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov 79 and with mers-cov 50 h wang et al 2020 lu et al 2020 we reasoned that existing host gene expression profiles of samples infected by sars-cov or mers-cov could approximate to those infected by sars-cov-2 to verify this assumption we compiled 331 signatures of various viruses from enrichr and geo table s1 and used an established pipeline to score 1740 drugs in our repurposing library for their ability to reverse virus-induced signatures b chen ma et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 clustering of these signatures based on their drug prediction scores suggests that signatures derived from the same virus or virus family under similar experimental conditions tend to cluster together figure s1 an example cluster includes one signature derived from primary human microvascular endothelial cells mmve001 after two days of mers-cov infection study id gse79218 and another derived from melanoma cells in mice after seven days of sars-cov infection study id gse68820 in addition spearman correlation coefficient of the in vitro drug efficacy data ec50 half maximal effective concentration for the sars-cov and mers-cov datasets is close to 06 figure 1b the clustering and correlation results suggested that drugs predicted based on the signatures induced by sars-cov or mers-cov may have potential applicability in sars-cov-2 therefore we developed a pipeline to identify repurposed drugs against mers-cov and sars-cov and then experimentally evaluate these drugs in sars-cov-2 figure 1c in total 430 samples from public repositories representing infection by mers-cov or sars-cov and a few other strains for comparison in different models eg cell line mouse models across multiple time points were used to identify disease signatures table s1 12 studies in total their expression profiles were created using either microarray or rna-sequencing depending on the profiling platform data processing and signature creation methods varied see methods the previous clusters figure s1 were highly confounded by post-infection time points figure s1 meaning the disease signatures and their predicted drugs were strikingly different under different time points therefore we enumerated all the possible comparisons figure 1c including 1 comparisons between infection and mock groups at each time point 2 comparisons between different time points within each of the infection or the mock group eg time point 1 vs time point 0 time point 2 vs time point 1 and 3 comparisons both between time points and between infection and mock groups these comparisons revealed different virus-related biological processes and their dynamic regulation for instance analysis of sars-cov infected lung tissue data showed that various biological processes including viral gene expression dna replication nuclear division lymphocytes differentiation and translation-related processes were activated figure 1d s2 and extended data 1 in contrast interleukin and autophagy-related processes were repressed in infected samples figure 1d s2 and extended data 1 interestingly these processes displayed time-dependent dynamics in infected samples eg 3 h and 12 h in figure 1e more examples of infection dynamics from other studies are shown in figure s3 for instance immune signaling pathways were down-regulated dramatically within the first 3 hours after infection while dna replication related pathways were first suppressed during this period but then activated until 12 h post-infection these observed host dynamic responses to virus infection suggests that comparisons between different time points are important to capture representative biological events throughout the course of a viral infection for each comparison we computed a disease signature to characterize the infection status followed by the prediction of which drugs may have activity ability to reverse disease signature as we could not directly evaluate the quality and pathologic relevance of each disease signature we validated them using those drugs identified to be positive in in vitro merssars-cov testing 41 positive drugs in total 30 with ec50 values table s2 among 215 mers-cov or sars-cov infection signatures only 13 signatures were able to recover these positive drugs which were shown to be highly enriched at the top of the predicted drug lists extended data 2 and 3 moreover ec50 of these drugs significantly correlated with srges figure 2a and figure s4 validating our analysis we did not observe significant enrichment of anti-coronavirus positive drugs using h1n1 infection signatures extended data 2 recent clinical data suggested that the combination of lopinavirritonavir offers clinical benefits to patients infected with sars-cov-2 chu et al 2004 lim et al 2020 both drugs were profiled in lincs subramanian et al 2017 the drug library we primarily used individually however none of them alone could induce substantial gene expression changes absolute z score  2 under 10 m concentration in cancer cell lines therefore neither was predicted as a hit we next found another dataset where heparg cells were treated with ritonavir at 10 different concentrations ranging from 9 nm to 300 m we observed that ritonavir could reverse nearly all the 13 disease signatures under high concentrations between 10 m to 200 m figure s5 thus we reasoned that the top ranked drugs with highly negative srges in these valid comparisons could be new therapeutic candidates merging disease signatures derived from different platforms and biological conditions is highly complicated therefore instead of merging them we calculated the consensus score of all the drug prediction lists derived from individual valid disease signatures we took the median of the ranks across multiple comparisons for each drug and ranked them based on their median rank extended data 4 mechanism of action moa enrichment analysis of the final ranked drug list revealed a number of significant drug classes including cdk inhibitors mtor inhibitors and nf-b pathway inhibitors figure 2b recently jeon et al jeon et al 2020 tested 35 fda-approved drugs for potential activity against sars-cov-2 among which 14 positive drugs were also represented in our screening library these drugs were also significantly enriched at the top of our final prediction figure 2c p  139e-4 further validating our analysis interestingly three anti-parasitic drugs pyrvinium ivermectin and niclosamide were ranked among the top 30 predicted drugs both ivermectin and niclosamide were shown to inhibit the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro caly et al 2020 jeon et al 2020 and pyrvinium and niclosamide were shown to be effective against mers-cov and sars-cov shen et al 2019 c-j wu et al 2004 we manually inspected the top candidates and selected ten representative candidates according to their reversal scores figure 2d extended data 4 clinical applicability moa and administration routes table s3 we then evaluated their cytotoxicity and ability to prevent cytopathic effect cpe in the vero e6 cell line table 1 instead of measuring ec50 we used more stringent criteria which required a 4-day complete prevention of cpe observed under the microscope seven of the proposed drugs could completely prevent cpe at concentrations  10 m however five of these presented unfavorable cytotoxicity at their effective concentration except methotrexate in a repeat experiment using a shorter drug treatment time of 2 h instead of 3 h we examined the efficacy and toxicity for the four most effective drugs preventing cpe at concentrations  1 m bortezomib methotrexate nvp-bez235 and alvocidib as well as chloroquine one of the drugs being tested clinically for sars-cov-2 however under this shorter drug treatment time none of the predicted drugs could completely prevent cpe as effectively as chloroquine which did so at 15 m the in silico external validations and our in vitro validations supported the robustness of our valid 13 infection signatures for drug discovery against pathogenic coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 to understand the underlying biology of these signatures and the impact of coronaviruses on the host biology we performed canonical pathway and gene ontology enrichment analysis of the commonly dysregulated genes ie up- or down-regulated in more than half of the 13 infection signatures figure 3 extended data 3 and table s4 more than one hundred suppressed genes were related to cellular responses to cytokine stimulus inflammatory response cytokine production etc figure 3a this corroborates with other studies channappanavar et al 2016 de wit et al 2016 which showed that sars-cov and mers-cov proteins interplay with the down-regulated jak-stat pathway in order to evade host immune response figure 3a in addition to cytokine-related genes other down-regulated genes include those involved in inflammatory mediators ap1 and atf2 pathways eg jun fos and ccl2 figure 3a and those related to il1 il4 il6 il10 and il13 signaling these interleukins were deficient in the early stage of sars-cov infection caused by delayed type 1 interferon signaling but then rapidly led to over-activated inflammatory cytokine storms channappanavar et al 2016 these down-regulated genes were also identified by two recent studies of sars-cov-2 infection gordon et al gordon et al 2020 identified 332 high confidence sars-cov-2-human protein-protein interactions among which 310 host genes were also found in our valid signatures for instance tbkbp1 related to type 1 interferons production trim59 and several other cytokine signaling related proteins bind to sars-cov-2 proteins eg nsp13 and orf3a blanco-melo et al blanco-melo et al 2020 profiled the sars-cov-2 transcriptional signatures in vitro and in vivo and observed a muted immune response that lacked robust induction of cytokines including type i and type iii interferons compared with influenza a virus and human orthopneumovirus these findings confirmed one common characteristic of mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 captured by our signatures the suppression of cytokine production and signaling in addition to immune evasion enrichment analysis of the down-regulated genes of our valid signatures suggested that viral infection inhibited host gene transcription go positive regulation of transcription by rna polymerase ii probably via the viral nsp-1 protein-induced host mrna degradation narayanan et al 2008 host response to amino acid deficiency or unfolded protein pathways reactome response of eif2ak1 hri to heme deficiency were also suppressed figure 3a by the virus in order to fully utilize the host cell machinery for its own replication moreover the virus down-regulated the integrin pathway figure 3a suggesting that it may disrupt intercellular surface interactions to prevent the infected cells from connecting with their neighbors the importance of sars-cov-12 recognition by integrins was highlighted by luan et alluan et al nd in terms of over-expressed genes 33 ribosome genes were commonly up-regulated in our infection signatures figure 3b suggesting the virus had already hijacked the host cell machinery for its own replication the biological processes including mitotic cell cycle nuclear division and dna replication were significantly over-represented this might be related to rho gtpase plk1 and aurora b signaling activation as implied by the up-regulated genes in our signatures figure 3b the sars-cov-2 human protein interactome gordon et al 2020 2 revealed that nsp7 binds to the host rho a gtpase agreeing with our infection signature where multiple rho gtpase effectors were up-regulated perhaps providing survival benefits to the virus van den broeke jacob and favoreel 2014 the interactome also revealed a high overlap between the sars-cov-2 nsp1-human protein interactome and proteins specific to the g1s transition of mitotic cell cycle interestingly coronavirus infection also promoted atr signaling figure 3b probably in response to dna replication stress this suggests a potential strategy to intervene with dna replication stress induced by viral proteins eg via the replication protein a complex xu et al 2011 after the first submission of this work gene expression profiles induced by sars-cov-2 infection were released gse147507 blanco-melo et al 2020 we created several sars-cov-2 signatures from the in vivo sars-cov-2 infection model and found four signatures that could identify the drugs known to be effective against sars-cov-2 in vitro table s5 the dysregulated biological processes of sars-cov-2 signatures showed remarkable overlap with our valid 13 infection signatures derived from mers-cov and sars-cov including suppressed cytokine signaling and atf2 pathways together with up-regulated mitotic cell cycle plk1 atr and rho gtpase pathways extended data 5 to illustrate the dynamics of host response to sars-cov-2 infection in vivo critical biological processes and pathways were analyzed across four time points within 14 days post-infection in the early stages of infection within 3 days post-infection immune response processes innate immune response il1 signaling nf-kb jak-stat were stimulated figure 3c these immune signaling pathways were suppressed from day 3 to day 7 then normalized to baseline at day 14 when the virus had been cleared from the body in addition three processes including proteasome-ubiquitin dependent protein catabolic process host gene transcription by rna polymerase ii and the eif2ak1 response of heme deficiency remained inactive until day 7 in contrast cell cycle related and viral replication processes were first suppressed and then dramatically activated from day 3 to day 7 figure 3d we also observed activation of non-sense mediated decay er localization and g1-s transition from day 1 to day 7 figure 3d the dynamics of virus-induced host gene expression changes suggested a tipping point of infection day 3 in this model where host cells were hijacked by the virus resulting in immune suppression host gene translation silencing and activation of protein synthesis these findings were also supported by further analysis where infection signatures derived from the comparison of day 7 and day 3 rather than the comparison of day 3 and day 1 resulted in significant enrichment in positive drugs p  0001 srges and ec50 correlation  053 table s5 this suggests that reversal of the hijacked gene expression changes between a specific time interval may be useful in designing novel antiviral therapeutics and strategies in this study we investigated host gene expression changes induced by coronavirus mainly sars-cov and mers-cov infection to characterize the infection signatures for use in drug discovery for sars-cov-2 out of 215 infection signatures only 13 signatures could be used to accurately predict drug candidates that have been reported to be active against sars-cov or mers-cov a large number of signatures did not provide useful information and this could be due to variations in experimental models or conditions such as virus incubation times for example samples using virus strains dorf6 batsrbd in gse4796 might be different from the wildtype sars similarly samples using ferret as the model for immune response investigation in study gse22581 might require additional deconvolution of profiles to dissect the response in host cells in study gse79218 dysregulated pathways induced by mers-cov in human microvascular endothelial cells showed marked variations depending on the time post-infection figure s3e and f those disease signatures were not able to capture the biology of viral infection thus failed to recover known drugs these observations underscore the challenge of choosing appropriate experimental models and conditions especially time points post-infection in our bioinformatics approach to find repurposed drugs for sars-cov-2 kupferschmidt and cohen 2020 after the first submission of this work gene expression profiles induced by sars-cov-2 infection were released we then computed the sars-cov-2 signatures in a549 calu3 and nhbe cells nhbe and a549 cells with low viral load moi 02 did not show substantial transcriptional changes less than 50 differentially expressed genes mapped to lincs partially due to their poor permissibility for sars-cov-2 hoffmann et al 2020 and low viral load a greater number of signature genes were identified in calu3 and a549 cells with high viral load moi 20 however the positive control drugs showed a virus-mimicking effect rather than a reversal of disease gene expression table s5 in calu3 and a549 cells only the 24 h post-infection profiles were available however other studies have shown that many infection signature genes have reverted back to normal at this time point figure s3 considering the infection dynamics and varying cell permissibility these signatures at 24 h might only capture the characteristics of host cell immune response against the virus and not that of other processes such as viral replication indeed the in vivo experiment with 14 days drug treatment performed in the same study hoffmann et al 2020 led to signatures that could recover known drugs we developed a consensus score for each drug based on their potency to reverse the 13 valid infection signatures the prediction was externally validated by a recent drug screen against sars-cov-2 jeon et al 2020 and justified our approach based on reversal of host cell gene expression induced by sars-cov or mers-cov infection based on various criteria including predicted drug ranking and known moa we selected 10 drugs to test their antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity in the vero e6 cell line we observed that four of these 10 drugs prevented cpe within 1 m but three of them were toxic at this concentration we initially excluded only highly toxic compounds such as topoisomerase inhibitors but did not attempt to evaluate their cytotoxicity since these candidates are fda approved drugs or undergoing clinical trials and therefore have established safety profiles the most potent candidate methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent at high doses and an immune suppressor at lower doses used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra methotrexate showed considerable in vitro antiviral effect and relatively low toxicity the direct binding target of methotrexate dihydrofolate reductase dhfr is an important enzyme in the folate metabolism pathway dhrf is up-regulated in most of our valid signatures together with the folate transporter slc46a1 extended data 3 folate is required for the metabolism of several amino acids and is vital for nucleic acid synthesis which could be utilized by the virus from the lincs drug profiles we found that methotrexate could down-regulate genes related to g2m cell cycle eg melk kif14 and birc5 and up-regulate genes related to cytokine signaling eg ccl2 cxcl2 and nfkbia figure 2d this is congruent with previous observations that some interferon related pathways governing inflammation overlap with cancer musella et al 2017 recently another ra drug tocilizumab an il-6 antibody was used to treat sars-cov-2 patients with severe symptoms to protect them from life-threatening lung damage caused by cytokine storms further analysis of drug-induced in vivo profiles geo accession gse56426 and gse25160 revealed that methotrexate and tocilizumab could reverse several genes in our infection signatures that govern negative regulation of viral genome replication and viral life cycle annotated with go0045071 and go1903901 figure s6 chloroquine has a lesser reversal effect on these genes suggesting a different moa from methotrexate and tocilizumab interestingly most of these virus-blocking genes are also interferon-stimulated genes isgs such as isg15 and oas1 thus further testing of methotrexate in interferon sufficient cell lines compared with interferon deficient vero cells could be of great interest the other three candidates are anti-cancer agents namely bortezomib nvp-bez235 and alvocidib in cancer cells proteasome inhibition by bortezomib induces er stress and constitutive er stress causes calcium release resulting in apoptosis landowski et al 2005 nvp-bez235 inhibits pi3k kinase and mtor kinase in the pi3kaktmtor kinase signaling pathway which may result in apoptosis of hyperactive cells and inhibition of growth in pi3kmtor-overexpressing cells netland et al 2016 alvocidib is a cdk inhibitor acting through inhibition of mcl1 expression that leads to apoptosis of cells arbour et al 2008 in other independent drug repurposing efforts for anti-sars-cov-2 anti-cancer drugs like axl receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gilteritinib and cdk inhibitor abemaciclib were also identified in vitro jeon et al 2020 weston et al 2020 these anti-cancer drugs inhibit sars-cov-2 infection likely through targeting the hijacked host cells with hyperactive transcription and translation however it is a double-edged sword with good efficacy yet unfavorable cytotoxicity especially for severely ill patients weakened by over-activation of the inflammatory system importantly the 13 valid infection signatures also provided a comprehensive understanding of the impact of coronavirus infection on the host response especially the time-dependent dynamics of changes in biological processes which may provide useful insights into designing clinically useful treatment strategies these signatures captured several critical viral processes related not only to mers-cov and sars-cov infections but also to sars-cov-2 infection and thus might be applicable to studying future pathogens within this coronaviruses family rationally targeting these dysregulated pathways at specific time intervals may result in promising therapeutics against coronavirus infection our study is restricted by the limitations of the lincs datasets eg limited coverage of the transcriptome another limitation is the use of drug-induced gene expression profiles derived from cancer cells that are different from the virus-infected cells used to generate the infection signatures this may partially explain why antiviral drugs were not predicted as hits nevertheless given the currently limited resources and the imperative need to find treatments for covid-19 existing fda-approved drugs that are identified regardless of established moa should be further studied in infectious disease models in conclusion open science initiatives have allowed us to leverage public resources to rationally predict drug candidates that might reverse coronavirus-induced transcriptomic changes the unbiased search for drug candidates based on reversal of gene expression could offer an effective and rapid means to propose drug candidates for further experimental testing even those that may have unexpected moa however more layers of information such as toxicity experimental validation conditions and clinical applicability could be incorporated to find improved therapeutics the predicted drug list and valid infection signatures resulting from our study may provide a starting point for researchers to further validate these and other candidates during this time of urgency we obtained a total of 430 samples for sars-cov or mers-cov related data from arrayexpress gene expression omnibus geo and sequence read archive sra the metainformation of each sample was manually annotated including virus strain model organism and time point the expression matrix for each microarray data was downloaded via the geoquery r package the matrix was further filtered by removing the probes with expression in only half of the samples expression values were normalized using quantile normalization and log2 transformation was applied for each matrix the probe values were collapsed based on entrez gene id the significance analysis of microarrays sam method was used to compute differentially expressed de genes with criteria fold change  1 and false discovery rate fdr  005 gene symbols of other organisms were converted to hugo gene symbols for rna-seq datasets raw sequence data were downloaded from sra and processed with the toil pipelineliu et al 2019 vivian et al 2017 edger was used to compute de genes using the same criteria as used for microarray data gene ontology enrichment analysis of de genes for each comparison was performed using the clusterprofiler r package further gene set enrichment ssgsea for each biological process was performed using ssgsea method in the gsva r package for the infection group we enumerated all the comparisons across all time points and corresponding comparisons were performed in the mock group the de genes that were uniquely present in the infection group were selected for further analysis we also compared de genes between infection and mock groups at each time point together with consistently dysregulated genes from the first to last time point drug gene expression profiles have been widely used in our previous studies briefly a full matrix comprising 476251 signatures and 22268 genes including 978 landmark genes as of september 2013 was downloaded from the lincs website httpsclueio the metainformation of the signatures for example cell line treatment duration treatment concentration was retrieved via lincs application program interfaces the matrix and metadata are now available via gse92742 in geo the signature derived from the comparison of gene expressions between the perturbagen- or vehicle control-treated samples represents gene expression changes upon treatment we further downloaded the lincs drug information from the drug repurposing hub only small molecules with high quality gene expression profiles isgold1 annotated in the metainformation and which are listed in the drug repurposing hub were further analyzed the computation of reversal of gene expression score rges and the summarization of rges to give the summarized rges or srges were detailed elsewhere and recently implemented as a standalone r package zeng et al 2019 in short we quantified the reversal of disease gene expression as rges a measure modified from the connectivity score developed in other studies sirota et al 2011 subramanian et al 2017 to compute rges we first rank genes based on their expression values in each drug profile an enrichment scores for each set of up- and down-regulated disease genes were computed separately using a kolmogorovsmirnov-like statistic followed by merging of scores from both sets updown the score is based on the extent to which the genes up or down-regulated disease genes are located at either the top or bottom of the ranked drug profile one compound may have multiple available expression profiles because they have been tested in various cell lines drug concentrations treatment durations or occationally different replicates resulting in multiple rges for one disease prediction we set a reference condition ie concentration of 10 m treatment duration of 24 h and used a model to estimate a new rges if the drug profile under the reference condition was not available we summarized these scores as srges without weighting the cell lines we considered predictions to be insignificant if the maximum of the absolute srges is  025 drugs with known in vitro activity against two coronaviruses ie sars-cov and mers-cov served as positive controls to select valid infection signatures qualifying signatures should meet the following criteria 1 derived from sars-cov or mers-cov infection experiments 2 the number of differentially expressed genes was  50 mapped to lincs 3 the maximum absolute srges prediction was  025 4 the srges of positive drugs was enriched at the top one side wilcoxon rank-sum test p  005 fdr  025 5 the srges and the average ec50 value of positive drugs were highly correlated spearman r  04 p  005 we downloaded the compiled virus-perturbed signatures from enrichr 323 in total since the enrichr dataset did not include any mers-cov signatures we manually added the signatures of two mers-cov datasets gse79218 gse79172 8 in total computed from the comparisons of separate infected groups and mock groups only virus signatures containing more than 50 lincs landmark genes were selected each virus signature was queried against the lincs library using the established pipeline only those signatures where the maximum of the absolute srges was  025 were chosen for subsequent analysis viruses were clustered based on the srges scores using pvclust suzuki and shimodaira 2006 distance method spearman correlation nboot  100 ritonavir was originally developed as an inhibitor of hiv protease and is now often used at a low dose with other protease inhibitors to boost its antiviral effect we found one rna-seq dataset sra srx4939022 for heparg cells treated with multiple compounds including ritonavir under multiple concentrations ranging from 9 nm to 300 m we processed 90 profiles in the plate 2drgplate2 consisting of 10 concentrations each concentration has nine profiles the log2 tpm transcripts per million of each profile was subtracted by the median of log2 tpm of all dmso-treated samples in this plate resulting in one drug-induced gene expression profile the spearman correlation between the drug-induced gene expression and the disease gene expression used for the lincs prediction was computed a negative correlation means a reversal relationship to allow easier visualization of the selected drug candidates ability to reverse coronavirus-induced gene expression changes we combined the 13 valid infection signatures into one meta signature and summarized drug profiles from different experiments into one profile dysregulated genes were included into the meta infection signature if 25 quantile of log2 fold changes was  1 or 75 quantile was  2 for each drug all profiles z-scores level 5 in l1000 measured at 10 m were extracted including different cell lines and treatment times the value of each gene in the summarized profile was defined as the median of the head or tail 25 depending on which absolute value is larger if this quantile absolute value was  1 we defined it as the median of the z-scores of this gene across all the profiles extracted the matrix was composed of the meta signature genes and signatures of selected drug candidates we also included the profiles of two drugs predicted as negative hits and ordered the rows by the fold change of infection signature genes a heatmap was used to visualize the effect of selected drugs in reversing virus-induced genes when visualizing the transcriptome datasets for figure s6 from geo we processed the gene expression matrix in the same manner as the disease signature mentioned under computation of infection signature the log2 fold change values of all genes were then converted to ranking percentages finally a clustermap was computed for genes of our interest colored in red up-regulation or blue down-regulation the processed compound transcriptome profile was categorized into up- or down-regulated genes with a threshold of log2 fold change  1 or  1 respectively each group of genes was then submitted to enrichr e y chen et al 2013 httpsamppharmmssmeduenrichr to compute the gene ontology go enrichment analysis go terms with p-value  005 and adjusted p-value  005 were considered significant we also used msigdb subramanian et al 2005 httpswwwgsea-msigdborggseamsigdbindexjsp to calculate the enriched go c5 and canonical pathways cp under c2 enriched by the common dysregulated genes shown in more than half of the valid infection signatures vero e6 cells crl1586 atcc were grown in eagles minimal essential medium emem supplemented with penicillin 100 unitsml streptomycin 100 gml and 10 fetal bovine serum fbs sars-cov-2 uswa-1 isolate the 3rd passage in vero e6 cells from the original cdc atlanta material and sequence confirmed was used throughout the study the titer of the viral stock was 75  107 50 tissue culture infectious doses tcid50ml all experiments involving infectious virus were conducted at the university of texas medical branch in an approved biosafety level 3 laboratory a slightly modified vero e6-based standard micro-neutralization assay was used to rapidly evaluate the efficacy of predicted drugs against sars-cov-2 infection briefly confluent vero e6 cells grown in 96-wells microtiter plates were pre-treated with serially 2-folds diluted individual drugs for 3 h in the first instance and 2 h in the repeat experiment before infection with 100 infectious sars-cov-2 particles in 100 l emem supplemented with 2 fbs vero e6 cells treated with similarly diluted dimethyl sulfoxide dmso with or without virus were included as positive and negative controls respectively after cultivation at 37 c for 4 days individual wells were observed under the microscope to determine virus-induced cpe and the effects of tested drugs the efficacy of individual drugs was calculated and expressed as the lowest concentration capable of completely preventing virus-induced cpe in 100 of the wells toxicity to the treated cells was assessed by observing floating cells and altered

 since december 2019 an outbreak caused by a pathogen resulting in a respiratory disease occurred in wuhan china the disease was termed coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who and the causative agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 the disease is now a global threat and on 11 march 2020 who recognized the outbreak as a pandemic 2 and sars-cov-2 has infected more than 372757 and killed 16231 people according to who 2  coronaviruses a large family of enveloped highly diverse positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses is known to infect humans and animals resulting in respiratory hepatic neuronal and gastrointestinal diseases 345 until recently hcovs-nl63 hcovs-hku1 hcovs-229e hcovs-oc43 middle east respiratory syndrome-cov mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome-cov sars-cov were the six coronaviruses that affected humans 15678910 sars-cov and mers-cov are the coronaviruses responsible for the highest mortality rates in human 10 and 40 respectively 11 hence the recently discovered sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to affect humans when the genome of sars-cov-2 was isolated from patients and analyzed it was revealed that it is 795 similar to sars-cov while being 96 similar to a rdrp region from batcov ratg13 a bat coronavirus 12 although believed to originate from bats it is yet to be determined whether the virus was transmitted directly to humans or through an intermediate host minks and malayan pangolins have been suggested as potential intermediate hosts for the transmission of sars-cov-2 from bats to humans 11314 among confirmed cases it was reported that most 87 of the patients were aged between 30 and 79 years 1516 almost half the cases have one or several underlying medical conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes and hypertension 171819 case studies have revealed that the fatality rates were high among patients with underlying medical conditions 15  the symptoms of covid-19 include fever 88 cough 68 vomiting 5 and diarrhea 37 as shown in figure 1 20 less common symptoms include headache sputum production and hemoptysis 1151718192021 recently it has been pointed out that anosmia loss of smell and ageusia loss of taste may be symptoms due to infection with sars-cov-2 however some patients presented as asymptomatic cases 16 most patients had pneumonia and in 70 of patients lymphopenia was observed while increased prothrombin time as well as an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase were identified in some patients 21 radiologic analysis of the lungs revealed ground-glass shadow in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation that were mostly located in the middle and outer zone of the lungs 2223 patients with abnormal liver function with elevated aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase as well as a myocardial zymogram showing elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase were identified 24  covid-19 cases have been classified as mild severe and critical types mild patients had mild pneumonia while severe patients exhibited dyspnea increased respiratory frequency and blood oxygen saturation within 24 to 48 h and critical patients suffered from respiratory failure acute heart injury septic shock and multiple organ failure 1524 the median incubation period of covid-19 from first symptoms to dyspnea admission into a hospital and severe acute respiratory syndrome were 5 7 and 8 days respectively 21  autopsy revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage linked with fibromyxoid exudates and accumulation of mononuclear infiltrates mostly lymphocytes 25 microvesicular steatosis and lobular and portal activity were observed in the liver but it is unclear whether the damage was induced by sars-cov-2 or drugs while interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were also found in the heart 25 it has been observed that the main symptom of sars-cov-2 infection is fever 20 hence identifying individuals exhibiting a high temperature is an essential step in the diagnosis of covid-19 physical examination may help identify patients in a severe condition since they are likely to exhibit shortness of breath weakened breath sounds speech tremor and dullness in percussion 15 chest x-rays reveal patchy shadows and changes in the lungs mostly in the outer zone of the lungs which develop into multiple ground-glass opacity pulmonary consolidation infiltrating shadows and infrequent pleural effusion 15 computed tomographic ct scans of the chest provide clearer images of the pulmonary lesions as compared to x-rays whereby segmental consolidation and ground-glass opacity are observed mainly in the periphery of the lungs 15 although symptoms and radiographic analysis indicate the possibility of sars-cov-2 infection laboratory diagnosis is definitive since it allows the differentiation of the sars-cov-2 infection from other viral infections such as mers-cov and sars-cov infections 26 samples such as swabs nasal swabs trachea and nasopharynx extracts lung tissue sputum feces and blood should be isolated and used for testing 26 the virus can then be detected through polymerase chain reaction pcr a molecular diagnosis method that relies on the sequence of nucleic acids for detection 26 several primers have been established for the detection of sars-cov-2 through real-time reverse-transcription pcr rt-pcr which allows for rapid and specific identification of the virus 27 immunological methods such as immunofluorescence assay direct fluorescent antibody assay protein microarray semiconductor quantum dots mab-based rapid nucleocapsid protein detection and the microneutralization test can be used to rapidly investigate the presence of sars-cov-2 26 figure 2 shows the diagnosis method for sars-cov-2 although the main laboratory technique used to detect sars-cov-2 is pcr other methods have been suggested and developed for the detection of the virus clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr technology has been evoked to detect sars-cov-2 by using crisprs ability to hunt down genetic snippets 28 immunoassays that use monoclonal antibodies to detect viral antigens or use viral antigens to detect patient antibodies produced against the virus in the lateral assay format have been employed for the detection of sars-cov-2 28 the main advantage of immunoassays especially in the lateral assay format is that they can be used to detect the virus in less than 30 minutes without the need for trained personnel or instruments  mers-cov was transmitted by close person-to-person contact although primary cases of infection have been linked to contact with infected dromedary camels identified as the reservoir host for mers-cov transmission of the virus occurred via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing 29 similarly respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing was the method by which the transmission of sars-cov occurred during person-to-person contact although less common fecal transmission fomites and handling of animals also resulted in the transmission of the virus 30 although not completely clear the mode of transmission of sars-cov-2 is thought to be similar to mers-cov and sars-cov 29 transmission of sars-cov-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing 1931 asymptomatic carriers may also transmit the virus and hence play a crucial role in the spread of the disease 32 recently the prospect of fecaloral transmission of sars-cov-2 has been raised since the virus has been detected in the feces of covid-19 patients 33 this indicates that the virus can exist and replicate in the digestive tract but it is not clear whether eating sars-cov-2-contaminated food causes infection on another note perinatal infection with sars-cov-2 may cause problems including respiratory distress and abnormal liver function for the newborn but transmission of the virus through birth is yet to be confirmed as zhu et al showed that transmission did not occur 34 moreover it was recently reported that sars-cov-2 was able to remain viable in aerosols for more than three hours and that the virus can survive on plastics and stainless steel for up to 72 h 35 our limited knowledge suggests that cases tend to be in groups that occur in waves developing into larger outbreaks the first documented outbreak occurred in wuhan china 36 sars-cov-2 has infected over 292142 and killed 12784 people according to the who 2 based on the report 96580 cases have been confirmed in the western pacific region with a death toll of 3502 while 195511 cases and 10189 deaths were reported in the european region in the southeast asia region and african region 1990 and 1305 cases leading to 65 and 26 deaths respectively were reported some 27215 cases and 1877 deaths were reported in the eastern mediterranean region the numbers clearly indicate that sars-cov-2 is now a worldwide threat figure 3 shows the number of cases over the span of two months 22 january 2020 to 22 march 2020  the five countries with the most cases of covid-19 are china italy united states of america spain and germany as of 24 march 2020 37 the total number of cases reported in china is 81218 of which 73650 have recovered 3281 resulted in death 2888 are in a mild condition and 1399 are in a serious condition 37 in italy out of 69176 cases 8326 have recovered 6820 resulted in death 50637 are in a mild condition and 3393 are in a serious condition 37 the total number of cases reported in the united states of america is 54968 of which 379 have recovered and 379 resulted in death 37 with 36173 mild cases 2636 serious cases 5367 recovered cases and 3434 deaths the total number of reported cases in spain is 47610 37 as the country with the fifth highest reported number of covid-19 cases 34009 germany has 30282 mild cases and 23 serious cases and 3532 patients have recovered while 172 cases resulted in fatality 37 a total of 8077 cases have been reported in the united kingdom of which 7500 are in a mild condition 20 are in a serious condition 135 have recovered and 442 have ended in fatality 37 virion spike s protein responsible for the receptor binding s1 domain and cell fusion s2 domain of coronavirus is essential in determining the host tropism of the virus 38 s1 and s2 subunits are formed by the cleavage of a precursor whereby s1 dictates cellular tropism and viral host range with the receptor-binding domain 26 s2 is divided into heptad repeats 1 hr1 and 2 hr2 and mediates fusion of virus with cell membrane when the hr1 attach together and bind to the hr2 to form a six-helix bundle bringing cell membranes and virus in close proximity to trigger fusion 26 using hela cells expressing or not expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 proteins from humans used as the cell receptor for sars-cov entry it was revealed that sars-cov-2 was able to gain entry only in the cells expressing ace2 suggesting that ace2 is a cell receptor used by the virus 12 structural and biophysical analysis showed that sars-cov-2 has 10 to 20 times higher affinity as compared to sars-cov towards ace2 39 as sars-cov-2 is a recently discovered virus effective treatment options have not been established hence antiviral drugs including ribavirin oseltamivir ganciclovir ritonavir and lopinavir have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load 24 secondary infections were also observed and treatments were administered based on the sensitivity of the bacterial cultures to drugs 18 some of the general strategies to fight sars-cov-2 infection are respiratory support organ function support bronchoalveolar lavage extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and blood purification 15 spike s protein a major vaccine target for coronaviruses has been assessed in different types of vaccines designed for infections caused by coronaviruses including inactivated whole-virus particle s protein subunit vaccine virus-like particle with s protein incorporated into influenza virus or hepatitis virus protein live attenuated virus with gene deletion virus vectors such as modified adenovirus carrying s protein and deoxyribonucleic acid dna vaccine which encodes part or the full length of the s protein gene 26 a double inactivated vaccine was developed for sars-cov by inactivating the virus using sequential formaldehyde and ultraviolet inactivation and evaluated in mice models where it was able to elicit the production of high levels of antibodies against the virus 40 a recombinant sars virus-like particle vaccine consisting of influenza m1 protein and sars-cov s protein was developed using the baculovirusinsect cell expression system and tested in mouse models resulting in reduction of the virus in the lungs to below detectable levels and complete protection from death as well as triggering the production of high levels of antibodies against sars-cov 41 recombinant sars-cov lacking envelope protein was tested in mice and it was shown that the vaccine was able to completely prevent death and resulted in more rapid virus clearance 42 a small fragment of the s protein of sars-cov linked to a human igg1 fc fragment was able to induce high titers of antibody production in mice that neutralized infection caused by sars-cov 43 a dna vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids of mers-cov s protein was shown to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice and a dna vaccine encoding s protein of sars-cov was shown to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies in humans in a phase 1 clinical trial 4445 the aforementioned methods led to the development of vaccines against sars-cov and mers-cov that have already undergone phase 1 clinical trials 4546 as most coronaviruses have a similar infection pathway and structure the research strategies mentioned above could be used as the framework for developing effective vaccines against sars-cov-2 remdesivir is a drug that has recently been shown to possess activity against mers-cov 47 an effective result was reported when remdesivir was used in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 33 this would suggest that strategies similar to those used in the development of treatments against other coronavirus infections such as sars-cov and mers-cov could be used in the development of effective treatments against sars-cov-2  an anti-sars-cov peptide derived from the hr2 domain of sars-cov s protein s2 subunit that can bind to its hr1 domain resulting in the inhibition of the s protein-mediated membrane fusion and hence sars-cov infection has been identified 48 the same technique was used to successfully develop an anti-mers-cov peptide that could inhibit infection by the virus 49 therefore this technique could be used to develop an anti-sars-cov-2 peptide that could inhibit infection by the virus neutralizing antibodies could be used to target sars-cov-2 previously mice were immunized with the receptor-binding domain from the s protein of coronaviruses and the antibodies produced by the mice were humanized and isolated 26 another approach is the use of phage-display antibody library in combination with cloning of single b cells from human survivors to produce human antibodies 26 several neutralizing antibodies have been identified for use against sars-cov and mers-cov 5051 hence novel neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be developed for use against sars-cov-2 using the same technique drug repurposing can lead to new treatment options faster than discovery of novel drugs since safety profiles of the available drugs are already available one method for effectively selecting drugs for repurposing purposes is the use of bioinformatics to analyze the interactions of drugs with the proteins of the target organism in this case sars-cov-2 bioinformatics was recently used to identify drugs that could target sars-cov-2 and 78 drugs were identified as possible repurposed drugs 52 after refining the list of drugs by removing drugs found unfit for repurposing based on the effects of the drugs on the symptoms of sars-cov-2 and their side effects 30 drugs were identified 52 pseudoephedrine andrographolide atiprimod ysil6 tapinarof etanercept adalimumab infliximab chloroquine epinephrine thalidomide clenbuterol pranlukast afelimomab golimumab siltuximab olsalazine ibalizumab cefazolin abacavir myricetin n-formylmethionine ruplizumab framycetin ketoprofen maraviroc vicriviroc proline quercetin and artenimol are the 30 drugs that were identified as possible drugs to repurpose for use against sars-cov-2 another study also used bioinformatics tools to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed for use against sars-cov-2 fifteen approved drugs 4 drugs currently undergoing phase 1 clinical trials and 18 drugs in the pre-clinical stage were identified through chemoinformatics while 12 approved drugs 10 drugs currently undergoing phase 1 clinical trials and 10 drugs in the pre-clinical stage were revealed through specialist knowledge 53 who announced that clinical trials involving remdesivir lopinavir ritonavir and chloroquine would be conducted since the drugs showed anti-sars-cov-2 activity either in vitro andor animal studies 54 however it was reported that the use of ritonavir and lopinavir in combination did not improve survival or speed recovery 54 however who announced that the drugs should be tested on a larger scale with a variety of patients 55 remdesivir was initially developed to fight ebola chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug while ritonavir and lopinavir are used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 55 vitamin c has also been evoked for use in cases of sars-cov-2 infection since at high doses it could result in the immunosuppression of hyperactivation immune effector cells that cause lung injury in covid-19 cases while being a safe treatment option 56 sars-cov-2 is transmitted easily and is hard to control as such there is a shortage in stocks of face masks worldwide which facilitates transmission of the virus due to the overwhelming number of cases and ease of transmission many countries have issued movement bans hence air travel has been banned in many countries while countries that still have air travel usually impose 14 days of quarantine for travelers to identify if they are infected with sars-cov-2 one way in which people are being diagnosed is whether they have fever which is the predominant symptom of sars-cov-2 infection however many people are lying about showing symptoms such as fever and are avoiding temperature checkpoints by taking drugs that suppress fever one of the main challenges with covid-19 are the people that show mild to no symptoms and hence might not be detected as infected 57 a study has shown that more than 59 of the cases of covid-19 in wuhan were not confirmed asserting the presence of potential asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases that may be contagious 58 after the observation of 13 individuals that tested positive for sars-cov-2 by laboratory testing for 30 days it was reported that four of them did not show any symptoms suggesting the presence of asymptomatic carriers 59 however it does not mean that 31 413 of all covid-19 cases are asymptomatic we need to take into account the limitations of statistics due to the sensitivity and detection window the period during which viral shedding occurs to a detectable level in support it has been reported that viral shedding still occurs after symptoms end 60 the viral loads in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were reported to be similar suggesting a similar transmission potential for people showing mild to no symptoms as compared to symptomatic individuals 61 the fact that people showing mild to no symptoms may transmit the virus while being hard to detect as carriers increases the chance of transmission future studies should focus on studying the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 by identifying the mechanism by which the virus causes pathogenicity more insight might be obtained into the various molecules that can be affected by drugs and vaccines to effectively treat and prevent covid-19 cases as mentioned above several methodologies have been used for the development of vaccines against other coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov and can be explored for the development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 furthermore considering that sars-cov-2 affects the respiratory tract drug delivery options that effectively deliver drugs into the respiratory tract should be developed repurposing drugs that have been identified as potential drugs against sars-cov-2 should be screened in vitro to confirm that they have activity against sars-cov-2 the drugs that show effects in vitro should then be investigated in animal models followed by clinical trials  our current knowledge about sars-cov-2 is limited and there is no current treatment or vaccine for covid-19 cases the symptoms of covid-19 include fever 88 cough 68 vomiting 5 and diarrhoea 37 and transmission of sars-cov-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing therefore preventive measures should be used such as encouraging people to stay at home discouraging mass gatherings and exercising social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus future research should focus on understanding the pathogenicity of the virus since knowledge about pathogenicity might help in the development of vaccines and effective drugs   covid-19 drug discovery using intensive approaches ayumu asai masamitsu konno miyuki ozaki chihiro otsuka andrea vecchione takahiro arai toru kitagawa ken ofusa masami yabumoto takaaki hirotsu masateru taniguchi hidetoshi eguchi yuichiro doki hideshi ishii   since an unusual type of pneumonia which was distinct from common pneumonia in symptoms and lethality was reported in wuhan china in december 2019 nations across the globe have paid attention to this new infectious disease on 12 january 2020 the world health organization who httpswwwwhoint temporarily designated the virus causing this disease as the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on february 11 2020 the who officially renamed this infectious disease coronavirus disease covid-19 the coronavirus study group within the international committee on taxonomy of viruses also renamed 2019-ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 at present the covid-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world with cases reported in china 1 and 168 other countries areas and territories as of 20 march 2020 the covid-19 disease caused 8778 deaths as noted by the who httpswwwwhoint to fight against this pandemic scientists and healthcare workers have started to share their knowledge given the rapid spread of covid-19 and the smaller timeframe available for developing new therapies drug repurposing may be an ideal strategy that allows healthcare workers to treat covid-19 using previously approved or investigational drugs 2 here we gathered information that may be pertinent to drug discovery for covid-19 via a systemic review of the pubmed database httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed from 2000 to 2020 we searched the papers with corona covid mers and sars as keywords the publications that were described as the concerning biological characteristics interaction with human or homo sapiens therapeutic targets and therapeutic medications for their viruses are included in this review from 2000 to 2020 since some information is protected by patents this article surveyed published and shared information to establish a therapeutic strategy against covid-19 favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and is licensed as an anti-influenza drug in japan 5 one of the unique features of favipiravir is its broad-spectrum activity against rna viruses including influenza virus rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus previous studies demonstrated that favipiravir is effective at treating infections with ebola virus lassa virus and rabies and against severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 5 however favipiravir is not effective against dna viruses with regard to its mechanism it is reported that favipiravir antagonizes viral rna synthesis by acting as a chain terminator at the site where the rna is incorporated into the host cell by contrast oseltamivir tamiflu a neuraminidase inhibitor blocks the cleavage of sialic acid and the subsequent entry of the virus into the cell 5 importantly favipiravir unlike oseltamivir does not seem to generate resistant viruses 5 this property of favipiravir suggests a potential benefit in the treatment of critical infectious diseases such as covid-19 figure 1 remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that is used for the treatment of infections caused by the ebola virus and the marburg virus 6 however it has also shown activity against respiratory syncytial virus junin virus lassa fever virus nipah virus hendra virus and the mers and sars coronaviruses 789 remdesivir inhibits rna-dependent rna polymerases most likely through the delay of rna chain termination in the cell 10 it is therefore one of the most promising compounds for treating covid-19 4 umifenovir ethyl-6-bromo-4-dimethylaminomethyl-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-phenylthiomethyl-indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate trade name arbidol is a potent russian-made broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is used to treat influenza a and b viruses and hepatitis c virus hcv 11 although the mechanism slightly differs depending on the virus it is reported that umifenovir inhibits viral fusion with the host cell membrane and subsequent entry into the host cell 11 recently a trial involving the use of lopinavirritonavir lpvr which are protease inhibitors used to treat hiv in adults hospitalized with severe covid-19 showed no observable benefit of lpvr treatment beyond the standard of care 12 another retrospective cohort study tested umifenovir combined with lpvr versus lpvr alone against covid-19 13 the results showed a favorable clinical response with umifenovir and lpvr compared to lpvr alone 13 nevertheless further studies will be necessary to determine efficacy and the occurrence of resistance since sars-cov-2 needs to undergo activation on the cell surface umifenovir combined with lpvr will help prevent the entry of the virus the identification of more specific mechanisms may be beneficial for future clinical applications it was reported that chloroquine phosphate a well-established drug used to treat malaria was shown to have apparent efficacy and was acceptably safe when used against covid-19 in multicenter clinical trials conducted in china 14 in china it was recommended that chloroquine phosphate be included in the next version of the guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by covid-19 issued by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china 14 chloroquine which has been used since 1934 has several anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects that have been reported by previous studies 15 for instance chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects by inhibiting the ph replication of several viruses including flaviviruses coronaviruses and retroviruses such as hiv 15 moreover it is reported that chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects that involve decreasing the production and release of tumor necrosis factor- tnf and interleukin il-6 15 during a viral infection the immune response is activated and the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf il-1 il-6 and interferon-gamma ifn is increased chloroquine however blocks these events 15 accordingly chloroquine also prevents further deleterious mechanisms that may lead to acute respiratory syndrome such as the alteration of tight junctions the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases in microvascular permeability 15 previous studies showed that the inhibitory effects involve the inhibition of autophagy 16 autophagy is a response mechanism to cellular membrane stress induced by nutrient deprivation hypoxia and exposure to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents 17 in animal experiments chloroquine is highly effective in treating avian influenza a h5n1 virus infection by inhibiting autophagy 16 since chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine are clinically relevant inhibitors of autophagy 17 the application of chloroquine may be reasonable and facilitated a recent study using cancer stem cells demonstrated that mefloquine hydrochloride an antimalarial drug used to treat patients with resistance against chloroquine efficiently eliminated colorectal cancer stem cells by disrupting endolysosomal proteins rab57 18 given that this lysosomal-dependent mechanism is a common platform for viral infection 19 other inhibitors of autophagy may be worth examining for the treatment of emerging infectious diseases such as covid-19 in the context of drug repurposing for covid-19 it is also suggested that resistance against inhibitors of autophagy may be worth further examination previous studies indicated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the functional receptor for sars-cov 20 determined via single-cell sequencing 21 and the structural analysis of proteins 22 the latter study demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain rbd of the viral spike s-protein in sars-cov-2 shows a strong interaction with human ace2 molecules despite its sequence diversity 21 the authors also suggested that sars-cov-2 poses a significant public health risk for human transmission via the s-proteinace2 binding pathway 21 interestingly the study showed that ace2 was preferentially expressed by a small population of type ii alveolar cells and that males have higher ace2 expression than females 121 the study also suggests that the binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 will increase the expression of ace2 1 in many human and rodent studies ace2 expression is induced by treatment with ace inhibitors aceis or angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs which are commonly used as antihypertensive drugs 23 the expression of sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter b0at1 depends on the presence of ace2 in the respiratory tract 24 given that covid-19 includes symptoms such as fever 98 cough 76 dyspnea 55 and fatiguemuscle pain 44 1 its symptoms may be relevant to the respiratory expression of ace2 a recent retrospective study indicated that covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease cvd have a higher risk of mortality 25 lower lymphocyte counts and higher body mass indices bmi are more often seen in patients with serious conditions 25 a recent study showed that the use of aceis or arbs for treating cvd does not affect the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 25 in addition it has been reported that the small intestine is the organ expressing ace2 most highly 23 given that sars-cov-2 can be detected in the excrement of covid-19 patients 2627 these observed cases might involve cells in the small intestine infected with the sars-cov-2 binding receptor the crystal structures of s-protein binding to ace2 has been revealed as an important interaction between host and sars-cov-2 2829 in addition it is known that ace2 binds to angiotensin ii receptor type 1 atr1 and the sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter b0at1 also known as slc6a19 and that their bindings affect the binding between ace2 and s-protein 3031 moreover phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase pikfyve two-pore channel subtype 2 tpc2 and cathepsin l are important for entry into cells 32 among them it was reported that sars-cov s murine polyclonal antibodies targeting conserved s epitopes inhibited sarscov-2 entry 33 many therapeutic targets in the entry pathway via ace2 have been reported meaning ace2 would therefore be a promising target for therapy of sars-cov-2 it was reported that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus via s-protein as well as ace2 34 the interaction between the virus and the host cell membrane allows for viral s-protein-directed cellcell fusion and the resultant spread of viral infections 35 as another example relevant to drug repurposing and the ideal strategy for confronting covid-19 the specific role of dpp4 on covid-19 remains to be investigated further research is necessary to utilize dpp-4 as a therapeutic target for covid-19 it was previously reported that aminopeptidase n apn is involved in broad receptor engagement which promotes the cross-species transmission of covid-19 36 interestingly previous studies identified apn as a surface marker for cancer stem cells in the human liver 37 repurposing previous studies also allowed for the development of a polyethylene glycol-polylysine block copolymer-conjugate ubenimex that targets apn specifically 38 as drugs that can be repurposed low doses of apn inhibitors including ubenimex or its derivatives may be beneficial for inhibiting the spread of the virus although the modification of rna by methylation is critical in biology methylation is also important for the process of rna capping in coronaviruses 39 like the coronaviruses that cause sars and mers the mechanism of rna capping may also be a draggable target in sars-cov-2 rna capping plays a role in the transcription of viral rna as well as stability replication and evasion from the hosts immune response many rna viruses including the coronaviruses have evolved mechanisms for generating their cap structures with methylation at the n7 position of the capped guanine and the ribose 2-o-position of the first nucleotide this mechanism plays a critical role in pre-mrna splicing mrna export 40 rna stability via the blocking of degradation by 5-3 exoribonuclease 41 translation initiation by promoting host eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e eif4e binding 42 and escaping the hosts innate immune system 43 in general 5-end-capped mrnas are produced through several steps 39 although there is no evidence to demonstrate the existence of an rna guanylyltransferase gtase that is unique to coronaviruses the coronaviral guanine-n7-methyltransferase n7-mtase plays a role in processing rna to produce the cap-0 structure m7gpppn 42 in the proceeding reaction by 2-o-mtase to form the cap-1 m7gpppnm and cap-2 m7gpppnmpnm structures 44 both n7-mtase and 2-o-mtase are catalyzed via the transfer of a methyl group from s-adenosyl-methionine sam to the rna substrate through the dxgxpxga sam-binding motif during the methylation process s-adenosyl-homocysteine sah is generated as a byproduct given the proposed function of the viral rna cap structure in preventing 5-triphosphate terminal 5-pppn from activating the host innate immune response cap-0 and cap-1 45464748 antagonizing the interferon-mediated antiviral response cap-1 434950 and enhancing viral rna translation cap-0 51 it is proposed that coronaviral n7-mtase will be an attractive target for new antiviral drugs 39 it is suggested that drug discovery is just as worthwhile in testing anti-viral activity as the repositioning of drugs in the case of covid-19 although specific treatments including vaccines have not yet been developed for covid-19 effective prevention methods are now recommended on a global scale accordingly to overcome this pandemic developing specific inhibitors for viral entry and replication as well as drug repositioning will be necessary as above several clinical trials and drug repositioning studies are currently ongoing eventually new studies will allow us to better control this pandemic and identify new treatments computational calculation and artificial intelligence would help the rapid development of a therapeutic method on the other hand accurate crystal structure determination and much drug-response data are necessary for its success the efficient sharing of information will be important for overcoming this pandemic in the era of globalization  repurposing of drugs for covid-19 a systematic review and meta-analysis pinky kotecha bsc  light alexander enrico checcucci daniele amparore

remdesivir has shown no significant improvement in time to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient power discussion due to the paucity in evidence it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of covid-19 as currently there is no significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings a risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 introduction starting in december 2019 there was a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause in wuhan hubei province of china 17 the origin of the virus is unknown but there is an epidemiological link the huanan seafood wholesale market where there was a sale of wild animals such as bats 17  after notification of the world health organisation who on 31 december 2019 scientists were able to isolate a 2019-ncov from a patient and subsequently perform genome sequencing by the 7 th of january since then many cases have emerged internationally leading to the who declaring the novel 2019-ncov covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic 18  similar clinical features to previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted including presentations with fever dry cough and dyspnoea but very few presentations with prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms such as rhinorrhoea sneezing or sore throat 19  on imaging bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography ct scans have been noted the patients with severe illness developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and required intensive care unit icu admission and oxygen therapy these features bear resemblances with the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections however covid-19 patients rarely develop intestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea which was present in about 20-25 of those with sars-cov and mers-cov the mortality rate has been similarly described by cohorts 19 20 21 22 as 4-15 with many describing the memories of the novel coronavirus outbreak in china sars-cov in 2003 17 drugs used during sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are being considered 19  with no current universally agreed treatment for covid-19 the current care advised is for supportive management depending on patients needs including antipyretics for fever and oxygen therapy the repurposing of drugs can provide an avenue to find treatment options for covid-19 which has currently infected over 32 million people as of 2 may 2020 reported by the who 23 hydroxychloroquine hcq and chloroquine cq both anti-malarial drugs have been authorised by both us and french authorities as there is no adequate approved and available alternative to treat covid-19 24  these drugs have been shown to have potent anti-viral activity against covid-19 in in-vitro studies 25 26  both can have adverse effects with hcq a derivative of cq being less toxic when used long term therefore recently high-dosage of cq 12g with either azithromycin and oseltamir has not been recommended in patients with severe covid-19 due to safety issues 27  the use of anti-virals has also been trialled as previously screening of approved drugs identified anti-virals to have an inhibitory activity on sars-cov lopinavir an anti-viral also has activity against mers-cov both in vitro and in animal models 14  therefore due to the homogeneity of sars-cov-2 compared to the mentioned zoonotic viruses anti-virals which have previously been used are being repurposed remdesivir has also demonstrated effective control of covid-19 in-vitro 26 and has since been authorised for emergency use by the food and drug administration fda 28 the aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the data currently available regarding the repurposing of different drugs for covid-19 treatment this systematic review adheres to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines

studies examined the effects of cq 1 compared it to anti-viral treatment and 1 was a case series used in a news briefing 1 study analysed both clinical recovery and viral clearance cq was initially mentioned in a news briefing 3 with results from more than 100 patients which had showed it was superior to the control treatment in shortening the disease course as well as inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings and promoting a virus negative conversion subsequently huang et al 5 compared it to another proposed therapy lpv-r in a cohort study with 10 patients in the cq arm and 12 patients in the lopinavirritonavir arm with cq 70 of the patients had a negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr at day 7 90 at day 10 and 100 at day 14 compared to the lpv-r group where 58 of the patients had a negative rt-pcr at day 7 75 at day 10 and 92 at day 14 there was a delay in lung clearance based on ct imaging suggesting viral clearance does not translate immediately into pathological improvement in lungs with cq 20 had a ct scan improvement at day 10 and 100 at day 14 compared to anti-virals with 8 showing an improvement at day 10 and 75 at day 14 with cq discharge rates from hospital were 100 at day 14 but with anti-virals only 50 of the patients were discharged at day 14 6 studies examined the effects of hcq of which 2 also added azithromycin 4 compared it to a standardized care and 2 were case series with hcq and azithromycin 4 studies analysed clinical recovery whilst 6 studied viral clearance there have been 3 rcts in china in the study by chen et al 1  where the eligibility criteria are not known 30 patients were recruited with 15 patients in each arm it showed no significant difference p005 in negative seroconversion rate at day 7 with 87 negative in the hcq group and 93 in the control group and in time to negative seroconversion p005 time to normalization of body temperature was also comparable between the 2 arms and radiological progression using ct imaging showed 33 of the cases progressed of the hcq group compared to 47 in the control group chen et al 2 has included only mild cases with oxygen saturation sao2 93 and confirmed chest ct with pneumonia comparing hcq n31 to standard treatment n31 which was undefined the primary outcome was time to clinical recovery defined as cough relief and return of body temperature 366c on surface 372c under armpit and mouth or 378c in rectum and tympanic membrane maintained for more than 72 hours it was shown that normalization of body temperature was significantly p00008 shorter by 1 day in the hcq group 22 days compared to the control group 32 days there was also significantly p00016 reduced cough remission time in the hcq group 2 days compared to the control group 31 days it was also noted that overall 6 of the patients progressed to a severe illness and these occurred in the control group not receiving hcq 2 testing haemodynamic monitoring and intensive care this study included anyone over the age of 18 with a confirmed sars-cov-2 infection the primary outcome was the negative conversion of sars-cov-2 within 28 days secondary outcomes included alleviation of clinical symptoms defined as resolving fever to axillary temperature of 366c normalization of sao294 on room air disappearance of respiratory symptoms laboratory parameters and chest radiology within 28 days viral clearance was similar in both arms with a negative seroconversion rate at 28 days of 854 and 813 in the hcq arm and soc arm respectively the time to negative seroconversion was also similar with 8 days and 7 days in hcq and soc arms respectively the overall rate of symptom alleviation within 28 days was also similar with hcq 599 and with soc alone 666 the median time to alleviation of clinical symptoms was also similar with 19 days in the hcq arm and 21 days in the soc arm however in a subgroup analysis when confounding effects of other anti-viral agents was removed the efficacy of hcq on the alleviation of symptoms is more evident hazard ratio 883 95ci 109-713 changes in c-reactive protein crp and lymphocyte count were also analysed with the hcq arm showing a significantly greater decline p0045 in crp from baseline 6986 compared to the soc arm 2723 and a greater elevation in lymphocyte count from baseline in the hcq 0062 compared to soc 0008 which was not significant p0547 a french cohort study 7 enrolled 20 patients with hcq and 16 patients was a control regardless of their clinical status it has shown that hcq can provide clearing of nasopharyngeal carriage in 50 of the patients by day 3 compared to 63 without it the same research group have reported a case series 4 with 80 patients on a combination of azithromycin and hcq this showed negative virus cultures in 975 of those included at day 5 with only 15 requiring oxygen and 4 requiring icu however these results were rapidly questioned by another study 6 who followed the same regime of azithromycin and hcq but showed that at day 5 8 out of 10 80 of the patients were still positive for covid-19 rna a total of 8 studies regarding anti-virals was included 6 studies examined the effects of lpvr of these 2 compared it to a standardized care 1 compared it to favipavir 1 compared it to the combination of lpv-r and arbidol 1 compared it to arbidol and 1 compared it to both arbidol and a control group 1 other study compared favipavir to arbidol and a case series regarding remdesivir is also included 4 studies analysed clinical recovery whilst 5 studied viral clearance there are 2 rcts comparing lpv-r to control and one further compares it to arbidol cao et al 14 is the largest rct in this systematic review enrolling 199 patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging sao294 while on breathing ambient air 99 in the lpv-r group and 100 to the standard-care group the primary outcome was the time to clinical improvement defined as time from randomization to improvement of two points on a seven category ordinal scale or live discharge which was 16 days in both lpv-r and standardcare alone in subgroups of treatment within 12 days or later treatment there was no association with a shorter time to clinical improvement secondary outcomes measured included a 28 day mortality which was lower in the lpv-r 192 than in the

of patients with clinical improvement at day 14 which was higher in the lpv-r group 455 than in the standard-care group 30 and time to discharge which was shorter in the lpv-r group 12 days than in the standard-care group 14 days other secondary outcomes included duration of oxygen therapy duration of hospitalization and time from randomization to death which had no significant difference between the two groups in terms of virology the percentage of patients with detectable viral rna was similar in both groups on any sampling day 5 10 14 21 and 28 for example at day 5 34 in lpvr group compared to 329 in standard-care group however the mortality in this trial was 221 which is significantly higher than the mortality reported in descriptive studies potentially indicating that a severely ill population was recruited therefore the question of whether this anti-viral treatment may be effective in early treatment remains unaddressed another rct 11 recruiting patients with mild mild symptoms but no signs of pneumonia on imaging or moderate fever respiratory symptoms and pneumonia on imaging covid-19 compared lpv-r arbidol and a control group with no anti-viral medication the primary outcome was time of positive-to-negative conversion of sars-cov-2 from initiation of treatment to day 21 which was not significantly different p0981 time to viral clearance was 9 days 91 days and 93 days in lpv-r arbidol and control group respectively there was also no significant difference of negative conversion rates at day 7 p0966 and day 14 p0352 of treatment there was also no significant difference in secondary outcomes which included rate of antipyresis rate of cough resolution and rate of improvement of chest ct imaging at day 7 and 14 p005 to take into account the influence of time from onset to treatment this was evaluated in those who deteriorate to a severe clinical status 5 days compared to those who did not deteriorate 4 days and showed no significant difference p0619 however one cohort study 9 comparing 42 patients treated with lpv-r to 5 patients in the control group has shown a significant reduction in time for body temperature normalization 48 days in the lpv-r group compared to 73 days in the control group p00364 in one study 12  lpv-r has also been used with arbidol which has higher negative seroconversion rate both at day 7 with 75 negative in the combination group compared to 35 in the lpv-r group p005 and at day 14 94 negative in the combination group compared to 53 negative in the lpv-r group p005 there was also a significant difference p005 in the chest ct scans showing improvement in the combination group 69 when compared to the lpv-r group 29 another cohort study 15 has suggested favipavir is superior with a higher clinical recovery rate at day 7 defined as 72h recovery of body axillary temperature 366c respiratory rate sao2 98 and cough relief mild or none this was significantly different p00001 with 61 of the patients clinically recovered in the favipavir group compared to the 52 in the lpv-r group a case series 16 involving remdesivir for compassionate use in 53 patients showed a 68 of the patients

defined by either a decrease of 2 or more points on the six point ordinal scale or live discharge was 84 improvement in this case series 7 13 of the patients died 6 of which were receiving non-invasive ventilation overall mortality from date of admission was 056 per 100 hospitalisation days and when comparing patients receiving invasive ventilation 057 to those receiving non invasive ventilation 051 there was no substantial difference however the risk of death was greater among patients over the age of 70 hazard ratio 1134 and those with a higher serum creatinine hazard ration 191 post-searching a rct done at 10 hospitals in wuhan was published 31  this enrolled 237 patients who were covid-19 positive had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging had sao294 on room air and were within 12 days of symptoms onset 158 to the remdesivir arm and 79 to the placebo arm however only 155 and 78 in the remdesivir and placebo arm respectively were included in the per-protocol population due to withdrawal of consent receiving the medication for less days than the protocol and not starting the study the primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement defined as a two-point reduction in patients admission status on a six-point scale this was not significantly different in the remdesivir group 21 days compared to the placebo group 23 days in those receiving treatment within 10 days there was a numerically faster time to clinical improvement in those in the remdesivir arm 18 days compared to the placebo arm 23 days clinical improvement rates at day 7 14 and day 28 were not significantly different between the remdesivir group and placebo group however numerically at day 14 there was a higher clinical improvement rate at day 14 27 with remdesivir compared to 23 in placebo and at day 28 65 with remdesivir compared to 58 in placebo the 28 day mortality was similar between the remdesivir group 14 and the placebo group 13 other clinical outcomes such as duration of oxygen support duration of invasive mechanical ventilation duration of hospital stay time to discharge and time to death were not significantly different however numerically the days of invasive mechanical ventilation were lower in the remdesivir group 7 days compared to the placebo group 155 days in terms of viral load no differences were observed between both groups with a similar decrease in viral load in the same study adverse events were reported in 66 of the patients 18 serious in the remdesivir group the most common ones being constipation hypoalbuminaemia hypokalaemia anaemia thrombocytopaemia and increased total bilirubin adverse events were also reported in 64 26 serious of the patients in the control group including hypoalbuminaemia constipation anaemia hypokalaemia increased aspartate aminotransferase increased bloods lipids and increased total bilirubin overall more patients discontinued the drug due to adverse events in the remdesivir group 12 than in the placebo group 5 antiviral side effects ranged from 0-60 across the studies with reported side effects such as liver injury high transaminases high bilirubin leucopenia gastro-intestinal and cutaneous side effects diarrhea vomiting nausea rash one randomized controlled trial reported lpv-r adverse effects as 48 192 serious ones compared to 49 32 serious ones in the control group the same study reported that 14 of the patients could not complete the 14 day course of lpv-r due to adverse events there was only one case series regarding remdesivir which reported a 60 adverse event rate including increased hepatic enzymes renal impairment diarrhea rash and hypotension this included 23 of severe adverse events including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome septic shock acute kidney injury and hypotension 16 case reports 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 are summarised in table 4  in each of the cases a number of medications have been trialed antibiotics in 10 of the

june 9 2020  httpsdoiorg1011012020060720124677 doi medrxiv preprint having been declared a global pandemic with the numbers of cases rising everyday covid-19 has been an unprecedented challenge in a number of areas with a subsequent reorganization of the clinical activities 47  clinicians across the world have trialed repurposing a number of medications regarding cq it has been suggested as a more effective and inexpensive option when compared to anti-virals 5  a recent trial 27 has compared the use of high-dosage 12g and low-dosage cq and has suggested that a highdosage regimen with azithromycin and oseltamivir was not safe to continue due to concerns regarding cardiotoxic events myocarditis and qtc interval prolongation which can be associated with an increase in fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia however age can be a confounder as it can be associated with unfavourable outcomes therefore it was advised that high dosage cq should not be recommended in the treatment of severe covid-19 but these findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with non-severe covid-19 the results from randomized controlled trials using hcq have shown a similar negative seroconversion rate and time to clinical recovery when compared to standard care however it has been recorded that hcq may fasten normalization of body temperature and cough remission with some smaller cohorts showing benefit of hcq it is important to be cautious with results therefore overall the role of of hcq in the management for covid-19 may still remain promising but larger scale studies are required showing no difference when compared to standard-care alone however one rct has shown that lpv-r may have a lower 28-day mortality a shorter stay in intensive care a shorter time to discharge and an effect on clinical improvement the only study 16 regarding remdesivir identified in our search was an observational study about a compassionate use in patients with severe covid-19 which showed an 84 clinical improvement and that improved in the category of oxygen support in 68 of the cases after our search was carried out a rct 31 was published comparing remdesivir and placebo showing no significant advantage in time to clinical improvement mortality or time to viral clearance with remdesivir even if well tolerated however the power of this study was insufficient as it did not reach its target enrolment due to the marked reductions in new patient presentations in mid-march in wuhan the initiation of treatment might have been quite late in the disease course as there were restrictions on hospital bed availability to have a significant improvement in outcomes when summarizing the case reports it is challenging to draw conclusions however the clinical improvement of the patients reported with a use of a cocktail of medications is an important aspect to consider the present systematic review has several limitations the paucity of rcts the gold standard for comparing interventions is probably due to difficulties with randomization and blinding in the unprecedented and stressful environment faced by healthcare services therefore a large number of studies are observational or cohort studies which are quicker to organize and implement therefore obtaining results rapidly which is essential as the number of worldwide cases is rising at an alarming rate another limitation is that studies vary in the outcomes measured therefore side-by-side comparisons become more difficult due to this heterogeneity of the studies we were only able to perform a meta-analysis on a maximum of 3 studies in one of the analyses regarding negative seroconversion rate they were measured at different time points therefore not giving an accurate view a large proportion of the studies included also do not measure survival and morbidity outcomes which are important many of the studies included have also not been formally peer reviewed yet but due to the urgency of the pandemic draft manuscripts have been uploaded we included every study found in our systematic review which may have introduced bias therefore it is important to analyse all studies cautiously as the selection of patients is important as different studies have recruited patients with a different severity of covid-19 it is also important to consider the timeline of the administration of the medication as early administration of medication could be more beneficial than later in the course of the disease when using risk of bias assessment tools most of the non-rcts were at serious risk of bias due to confounders including baseline confounding factors such as the presence of comorbidities which could affect the outcome of the patient no blinding of patients or assessors can also pose a risk of bias due to the potential unreliable measurement of outcomes to our knowledge this is the first systematic review regarding the repurposing of drugs in covid-19 summarizing 16 studies as well as 16 case reports in conclusion it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the management of covid-19 due to the lack of evidence however likewise there is also no sufficient evidence to show these drugs are not successful in improving clinical outcomes and reducing viral load therefore it is important to balance the benefits of trialing this medication with the adverse events described where the spectrum of these has not been clearly understood accordingly there is a need for further high quality data especially from rcts to evaluate the benefits of these repurposed drugs in the treatment of patients with covid-19 we recognise there is a large global effort for this with the biggest covid-19 trial the recovery trial 48 having recruited over 8500 participants across 173 sites to date 1 may 2020 this randomized trial is inviting clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed covid-19 adult 18 years patients hospitalised in the united kingdom to participate with randomisation to one of 4 arms usual care usual care plus lpv-r usual care plus low-dose dexamethasone usual care plus hcq or usual care plus azithromycin those who deteriorate are further randomized between tocilizumab and a control group this study indicates no clinical effectiveness regarding the role of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral for the treatment of covid-19 patients however there is potential for these medications but further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings therefore a risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events all rights reserved no reuse allowed

aparicio-ozores juan casteln-vega a   in december 2019 a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases was reported in wuhan china wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 coronavirus disease covid-19 rapidly spread to other countries and by march 11th the disease was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who cucinotta and vanelli 2020 according to the who to date situation report 83 april 15th 2020 there are 1914916 covid-19 cases and more than 120000 covid-19-associated deaths worldwide world health organization 2019 the causal agent of covid-19 is a sars-related coronavirus named sars-cov-2 which was likely passed to humans in live-animal markets jalava 2020 there is strong evidence that sars-cov-2 originated in bats but was likely transmitted to humans through an intermediate animal probably the pangolin lam et al 2020 sars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus closely related to mers-cov and sars-cov which have also caused outbreaks with pandemic potential chen et al 2020a these outbreaks have affected the global economy causing high economic losses tripp and tompkins 2019 the sars-cov-2 genome is a single-stranded positive-sense rna of about 30 kb in length and contains at least six open reading frames orfs that code for a minimum of 16 non-structural proteins and 4 structural proteins chen et al 2020a lai et al 2020 orf 1ab is translated into a large protein that undergoes extensive proteolytic processing to yield the replicase complex which mediates viral transcription and replication bartlam et al 2005 chen et al 2020a the protease responsible for the proteolytic processing is the main protease mpro or 3c-like protease 3clpro which is matured by auto-cleavage into the dimeric active conformation xia and kang 2011 given the relevance for the viral replication cycle mpro has been proposed as a target in the development of inhibitors against coronaviruses bartlam et al 2005 yang et al 2006 drug repurposing also known as drug repositioning is the use of an active pharmaceutical ingredient to treat a novel medical condition different from the original intended condition and has arisen mainly by serendipity when beneficial off-target or secondary effects are noticed pacios et al 2020 pushpakom et al 2019 the use of currently approved drugs to treat different diseases has the advantage of assuring medical safety because the drugs have already been tested in animal models and undergone clinical trials additionally the infrastructure to manufacture at large-scale is already in place cha et al 2018 pushpakom et al 2019 drug repurposing is also a strategy that has been used to discover novel antibiotics or antiviral drugs dyall et al 2018 pacios et al 2020 in the case of sars-cov-2 many drugs with repurposing potential are already being tested li and de clercq 2020 the attractiveness of repurposing has led to the evaluation of at least 35000 drugs for more than one medical condition baker et al 2018 another advantage of drug repurposing is a quick approval in emergencies such as the current covid-19 pandemic taking this into consideration we performed in silico evaluation of a set of approved drugs as potential inhibitors of mpro from sars-cov-2 our findings show that several molecules warrant further analysis as treatment options against covid-19 a total of 111 sars-cov-2 genome sequences were retrieved from the gisaid platform shu and mccauley 2017 and aligned with clustal omega through the ugene platform okonechnikov et al 2012 sievers and higgins 2014 for homology modeling the betacovwuhanwiv022019 genome was analyzed with vgas zhang et al 2019 to predict the open reading frame orf corresponding to orf1a which contains the mpro sequence this sequence was used to predict the structure of mpro in its biologically active conformation dimer by using modeller ho et al 2015 webb and sali 2016 the following structures were used as templates pdb ids 2amd 1wof 2amq 2d2d 3e91 and 3ea7 yang et al 2005 a total of 20 models were generated and the dope discrete optimized protein energy score was used to select the best structural model global and local structural quality was evaluated with qmean which is a scoring function that measures the global and local quality of protein models estimating the degree of structural nativeness qmean uses a linear combination of structural descriptors that include long-range interactions torsion angles and solvation potential scores calculated form the structural descriptors are transformed into z-scores to compare them with high-resolution crystal structures qmean is available in the swiss-model server benkert et al 2011 waterhouse et al 2018 sequence conservation analysis was done with chimera pettersen et al 2004 the predicted structural model was submitted to the charmm-gui server to prepare the system brooks et al 2009 jo et al 2014 2008 lee et al 2016 the solution builder module was used to prepare the protein inside a water cube tip3p model and potassium chloride kcl was used to neutralize the system charge and to adjust the salt concentration to 015 m the charmm36 m force field was used and input files for gromacs were generated and downloaded huang et al 2017 the molecular dynamics simulation was performed with gromacs abraham et al 2019 2015 in three stages first a minimization stage steepest descent consisting of 5000 steps was performed to eliminate major atomic clashes in the system then an equilibration stage was performed in which protein movement was constrained to allow the solvent and ions to contact the protein harmonic force constants of 400 kj mol-1 nm-2 for protein backbone and 40 kj mol-1 nm-2 for sidechains were used with a total equilibration time of 250 ps and a time step of 1 fs at 310 k lastly the production stage was performed without position restrains for a total of 100 ns with a timestep of 2 fs at 310 k the resulting trajectory was visualized and analyzed with vmd humphrey et al 1996 and gromacs conformers from the resulting trajectory were clustered with the gromos method daura et al 1999 which generates non-overlapping clusters briefly the method starts with the rmsd calculation between all pairs of conformers in the trajectory the first cluster is formed when the biggest set of conformers sharing less than the cut-off is detected these conformers are eliminated from the pool of clusters the process is repeated for remaining conformers a cut-off of 018 nm was used to generate approximately 20 clusters from the 1000 conformers resulting from the molecular dynamics simulation the strategy to discover molecules that potentially inhibit mpro involved molecular docking of each molecule into the active site of mpro idock li et al 2012 was used as the molecular docking engine and the procedure was first validated by redocking ligand 9ni to the sars-mpro structure pdb id 2amd idock is a molecular docking program that was developed with a focus on virtual screening being capable of processing a massive number of ligands in a relatively short time it is similar to autodock vina a fast and accurate evolution of autodock with regard to the scoring function and to the optimization algorithm with emphasis on a faster execution the sars-cov-2 mpro structure and two of its main conformers extracted from the molecular dynamics simulation trajectory file were processed with autodocktools morris et al 2009 the small-molecule database consisted of 4384 molecules and was downloaded from zinc15 sterling and irwin 2015 these molecules corresponded to the world subset according to zinc15 these molecules have been approved for human use in major jurisdictions including the us food and drug administration the database was processed with the prepareligand4py script included in autodocktools to obtain the input files needed for virtual screening box coordinates for virtual screening were center x y z  933 105 20 and size x y z  223 221 242 the candidate molecules were selected according to the docking score predicted by idock the top 10 molecules from each conformer were further analyzed to select the potential inhibitors of mpro the 30 complexes were inspected visually with pymol httpspymolorg and discovery studio visualizer httpswww3dsbioviacom those molecules that made contact with the catalytic residues of mpro his41 and cys145 were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations the input files were prepared with charmm-gui as mentioned above with simulation times of 20 ns the resulting trajectories were visualized and analyzed with vmd and gromacs the stability of the ligands in the active site of mpro was estimated by calculating the rmsd root-mean-square deviation and the binding energy g was calculated with the cafe plugin liu and hou 2016 in vmd the cafe plugin consists of a set of tcl scripts that allow the calculation of binding free energies through the mmpbsa and lie methods and is powered by vmd namd phillips et al 2005 and apbs jurrus et al 2018 programs binding free calculations were performed with the mmpbsa method briefly receptor and ligand conformations are extracted from the trajectories then three energetic components are calculated the gas-phase energy difference between the complex the receptor and the ligand is obtained by calling namd then the polar solvation free energy is calculated with apbs subsequently the difference of solvent accessible surface area sasa is measured and the nonpolar solvation free energy is estimated by its approximate linear relation with sasa finally the binding free energy is summed and averaged throughout the selected conformations there are several experimental structures reported for the sars-cov-1 mpro which vary in amino acid sequence resolution and presence of additional molecules such as inhibitors or solvents consequently we decided to include structures 2amd 1wof 2amq 2d2d 3e91 and 3ea7 to model the structure of the sars-cov-2 main protease sequence identity of sars-cov-2 mpro with sars-cov-1 sequences ranged from 944  sequence corresponding to pdb code 2amq to 951  pdb codes 2amd and 1wof the resulting model is in the classical heart-shaped conformation fig 1
 with the binding site near the dimer interface the selected model had an rmsd0266  when compared with template 2amd the final mpro model was analyzed with the swiss-model server resulting in a global qmean score of -041 with only minor deviations in the n- and c-termini fig s1 these values indicate a good structural model suitable for use in the following analyses to observe the amino acid conservation of mpro amino acid sequences from 111 reported isolates were aligned and the degree of conservation was mapped into the mpro structure the most variable position had a 977 conservation which indicates that the active site of mpro is highly conserved among the analyzed isolates fig s2 next solvent-explicit molecular dynamics simulations were performed on mpro the resulting trajectory showed that the protein has a highly flexible active site as the amino acids surrounding the binding site had high rmsf root-mean-square fluctuation values the regions surrounding the binding site were the most mobile during the simulation figs 2
and s3 this flexibility makes drug discovery a challenge because a ligand that could bind to the closed site could not bind to the open state and vice versa therefore we proceeded to analyze the md trajectory and from 19 clusters that encompass the trajectory the two most representative conformers were selected fig s4 thus the virtual screening was done with the starting structure as well as two conformers mpro0 initial structure mpro412 conformer 412 which is representative of cluster 1 and mpro837 conformer 837 which is representative of cluster 2 virtual screening was performed with the mpro conformers and the 4384-molecule bank the top 10 binders for each conformer were selected for further analysis table 1
 docking score values ranged from -917 kcalmol dihydroergotamine to -1025 kcalmol bisoctrizole noticeably there are several drug metabolites glucuronides and drugs used in chemotherapy sorafenib beta-d-glucoronide n-trifluoroacetyladriamycin amrubicin daunorubicin idarubicin midostaurin maraviroc and celsentri ligands that contacted catalytic amino acids his41 or cys145 were the most promising candidates and thus were selected for further molecular dynamics simulations md simulations for the selected mpro-ligand complexes were carried out and the relative mobility of the ligand within the active site of mpro was monitored through evaluation of ligand rmsd fig 3
 in the case of mpro0 the most mobile ligand was ergoloid with an average rmsd of 76  and the most stable ligand was ergotamine with an average rmsd of 36  in the case of mpro412 the most mobile ligand was daunorubicin with an average rmsd of 72  and the most stable ligand was lorazepam glucoronide with an average rmsd of 34  lastly for mpro837 the most mobile ligand was lorazepam glucoronide with an average rmsd of 78  and the most stable ligand was ketotifen-n-glucoronide with an average rmsd of 35  binding free energy was calculated for each complex the initial 5 ns were not considered for calculation and the results are indicated in table 2
 it is noteworthy that complexes with conformer mpro0 and mpro412 had the lowest binding free energy values after considering all the bioinformatics analyses we posit that ligands daunorubicin ergotamine bromocriptine meclocycline amrubicin ergoloid ketotifen-n-glucoronide n-trifluoroacetyladriamycin 5a reductase inhibitor are good candidates as mpro inhibitors and therefore warrant further evaluation as potential treatment against sars-cov-2 infection a race against time is currently underway to develop safe and effective antivirals against sars-cov-2 drug repurposing is a straightforward strategy when time is a critical factor such as in this covid-19 pandemic phadke and saunik 2020 pushpakom et al 2019 indeed the us food and drug administration has encouraged the use of the app cure id for health care professionals to report novel uses of existing medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases httpscurencatsio and there are several studies some in clinical phases that involve the repurposing of approved drugs pacios et al 2020 on the other hand bioinformatic studies are useful in detecting drugs that can be used in in vitro studies or clinical trials as treatment options against covid-19 in this work a set of nine currently approved drugs was identified as having the potential to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro and therefore could be used as a covid-19 treatment either alone or in combination with other drugs some of the most promising strategies involve the use of chloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin as well as remdesivir gautret et al 2020 wang et al 2020a however the efficacy of these therapies is as yet unknown regarding mpro currently there is at least one clinical trial involving the use of protease inhibitors as a treatment for covid-19 clinical trial nct04303299 and there are several reports of potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 mpro chen et al 2020b khan et al 2020 li and de clercq 2020 ton et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 these reports use computational approaches to identify molecules with mpro inhibitory potential however our work is the only one that considers the flexibility of the active site which allowed us to propose a greater diversity of potential mpro inhibitors mpro is an excellent target for computer-assisted drug discovery because it is critical in the early stages of viral replication chen et al 2020a however we found that the substrate-binding site is highly flexible therefore virtual-assisted drug design approaches should take flexibility into account when this work started there were no structures available for sars-cov-2 mpro however two experimental structures have been reported to date pdb id 6lu7 and 6w63 jin et al 2020 a rapid analysis showed that the b-factors of 6lu7 agree with our results supplementary fig s5 therefore the homology model constructed in this work is valid for our purposes md simulations had a duration of 20 ns and the first 5 ns were discarded for binding-free energy analysis to allow the system to equilibrate there is no consensus about the duration of a molecular dynamics simulation but it has been found that longer simulations do not necessarily improve binding free energy calculations hou et al 2011 we chose 20 ns as a result of a literature search in which simulation times ranged from 15 ns one protein-ligand complex to 200 ns several protein-ligand complexes kumar et al 2019a mittal et al 2020 to define the duration of a simulation run the complexity of the phenomena under study and the size of the system should be considered also depending directly on the available computer power overall studies involving one complex normally used longer simulation times kumar et al 2019b wang et al 2020b and studies involving several complexes used shorter simulation times ge et al 2013 razzaghi-asl et al 2018 binding free energies ranged from -1388 kcalmol to 36 1 kcalmol at first sight these values are noticeably higher than expected considering that the experimental g value for the avidin-biotin complex is -204 kcalmol the reason for this discrepancy is the solute dielectric variable used for our calculations in fact the use of different solute dielectric values can significatively shift the binding free energy calculation to a more negative or positive value li et al 2018 in the case of the avidin-biotin complex a solute dielectric variable of 10 agrees well with experimental values since calculations made with the cafe plugin indicate a g  -208 kcalmol when a solute dielectric  10 was used this value is close to the experimental binding free energy -204 kcalmol green 1975 the choice of the solute dielectric value depends on the charges present at the binding interface and increases as more charges are present usually values of 10 20 and 40 are used depending on the nature of the binding site hou et al 2011 more often values ranging from 20 to 40 are used when studying binding sites with polar or charged amino acids are present for proteases similar to mpro the solute dielectric value that correlates best with experimental results is 40 sun et al 2014 three of the proposed drugs are used in chemotherapy daunorubicin amrubicin and the valrubicin metabolite n-trifluoroacetyladriamycin piska et al 2017 these drugs as well as meclocycline a highly toxic antibiotic should be treated carefully because of side effects in the organism two of the drugs identified in this study indomethacin and glycyrrhizinate have also been tested in vitro and proposed as potential therapies against coronavirus amici et al 2006 hoever et al 2005 however the binding free energy analysis suggests that mpro might not be the primary target of these molecules despite the increasing number of publications related to virtual screening focused on mpro jin et al 2020 ton et al 2020 j wang 2020 there is little agreement between them on potential candidates identified of all the reported drugs found in this work only valrubicin also was identified in another study as a potential inhibitor of mpro j wang 2020 this may be explained by the diversity of the selected databases and the algorithms used in docking and virtual screening however if the original purpose of the drug is considered similarities arise between our findings and those of jin et al 2020 where drugs used in chemotherapy and antihistamines potentially inhibit mpro given the emergency we are currently facing this diversity of results may turn out to be beneficial because more options are available to repurpose these drugs as covid-19 treatment options again the drugs mentioned in this article should not be used as treatment against covid-19 unless they have been tested in proper clinical trials the main protease of sars-cov-2 has a very flexible active site an aspect that must be considered in rational drug design our approach involved the use of three conformers of mpro and led to the identification of nine molecules that warrant in vivo testing or even in clinical trials so they can be repurposed as treatment of covid-19 the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

in early january 2020 the world health organisation who reported cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause in wuhan city hubei province of china and by 30 january 2020 who escalated the warning to public health emergency of international concern by 12 march 2020 the novel coronavirus ncov outbreak achieved a global pandemic status and was recognised as novel covid-19 disease ncovid-19 1 the present coronavirus outbreak is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 sars-cov-2 phylogeny and taxonomy designated 2 worldometer reported the total sars-cov-2 infected cases on 31 may 2020 as 6238550 and deaths 374374 worldwide httpswwwworldometersinfocoronaviruscountries the pathogen has been established to transmit from human to human contact and has quickly spread to more than 187 countries across the globe httpsgisanddatamapsarcgiscom coronaviruses are single and positive stranded rna viruses belonging to the genus coronavirus of the family coronaviridae that can cause acute and chronic respiratory and central nervous system illnesses in animals including in humans 3 4 the infection can also cause mild episodes of follicular conjunctivitis in certain patients in animal models the infection has been shown to induce anterior uveitis retinitis and optic neuritis like symptoms 5 recent study has shown formation of hyper-reflective lesions in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers of the retina particularly around the papillomacular bundles 6 the disease has also been shown to affect sense of smell and taste bud sensitivity in patients 7 all coronaviruses have a minimum of 3 basic viral proteins i an envelope protein e which is a highly hydrophobic protein involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle such as assembly and envelope formation 8 ii a spike protein s a glycoprotein involved in receptor recognition and membrane fusion 9 and iii a membrane protein m which plays a key role in virion assembly 10 fig 1 the viral genome also encodes two open reading frames orf orfa and orfb that activate intracellular pathways and triggers the host innate immune response 11 the polyprotein encoded by the virus are initially processed by two main viral proteases which include a papain-like cysteine protease plpro and chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known as 3c-like protease 3clpro into intermediate and mature non-structural proteins 12 the main proteinase 3clpro is one of the primary targets for development in an antiviral drug therapies as it plays a critical role in the viral replication 13 k11777 camostat and est are cysteine protease inhibitors which have been shown to inhibit sars-cov 3clpro replication in cell culture conditions 14 15 recent release of the high-resolution crystal structure for the main proteinase 3clpro protein data bank pdb id 6y2g describing an additional amide bond with the -ketoamide inhibitor pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma 16 is suggested to accelerate the targeted drug discovery efforts two hiv-1 proteinase inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir have been considered to target sars-cov 17 interestingly the substrate binding cleft is located between domains i and ii of both sars-cov 3clpro and sars-cov-2 3clpro enzymes 16 18 since the initial stages of the sars-cov-2 outbreak laboratories and hospitals around the world have sequenced viral genome data with unprecedented speed enabling real-time understanding of this novel disease process which will hopefully contribute to the development of novel candidate drugs the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 from all over the world have been deposited at the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid 19 database and more sequences continue to be deposited with the passage of time development of a novel vaccine against sars-cov-2 so far remains elusive and requires a thorough understanding of molecular changes in viral genetics this may be attained by freely accessing the gisaid database and processing the data to enhance our understanding of the fine biochemical and genetic differences that differentiate this virus from the previously known strains 20 it is well known that viruses are non-living and that they require host cells to survive and to reproduce with the sole aim to perpetuate themselves when a virus jumps from animal to human it is termed a zoonotic virus this occurred during the sars outbreak of 2002 when a new coronavirus spread around the world and resulted in death of hundreds of people 21 in 2012 another novel coronavirus outbreak termed middle east respiratory syndrome mers caused over 400 fatalities and spread to over 20 different countries 22 there are currently many circulating viruses but why sars-cov-2 has achieved such a devastating pandemic status and whether this pandemic will subside remain unanswered the purpose of this study is to characterise known viral variants that have spread across different countries especially hot-spot regions with a focus on recurrent mutations in south american and african geographical regions we also focused on the sars-cov-2 main proteinase 3clpro which is highly conserved in most of the coronaviruses and has been suggested to be a potential drug target to fight against ncovid-19 repurposed drugs such as flavonoids and biflavanoids known anti-malarial and anti-viral drugs and the inhibitory effects of vitamins could selectively inhibit this enzyme and can be used either alone or in combination with other disease management approaches to suppress the virulence of sars-cov-2 these bioinformatics computational modelling and molecular docking approaches using repurposed drugs could be particularly useful in the current ncovid-19 outbreak the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid is headquartered in munich germany and is a publicprivate partnership project between german government and the non-profit organization founded by leading medical researchers in 2006 since december 2019 gisaid has become a repository storage database for ncovid-19 genome the genome analysis was carried out for data deposited up to 31 may 2020 httpswwwgisaidorg severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 wuhan genome was collected from ncbi nc0455122 multiple sequence alignment msa of all nucleotide sequences were carried out in the embl-ebi clustal omega server to investigate sequence conservation 23 24 the newick format for the multiple align sequence was used to generate phylogeny 25 the phylogenetic tree was constructed in the interactive tree of life itol online tool 26 the itol server generate phylogeny trees in a circular radial and normal standard trees the circular trees can be rooted and displayed in different arc sizes 2729 crystal structure of sars and sars-cov-2 3clpro with bound inhibitors were collected from the protein data bank pdb 30 pdb id 3tnt sars main protease was selected as reference to analyse the variants in sars-cov-2 3clpro pdb id 6y2g all the pdbs were visualised using ucsf chimera software 31 multiple alignment ribbon surface and superimposition module in chimera software were used for analysis and image generation 24 32 the dataset comprises of flavones and biflavanoids anti-viral anti-malarial and vitamins as sars-cov-2 3clpro inhibitors 16 in total 17 repurposed drugs were collected from the pubchem database 33 two-dimensional 2d structures were downloaded from the pubchem database insdf format the inhibitor energies were minimized using the austin model-1 am1 until the root mean square rms gradient value became smaller than 0100 kcalmol  and later re-optimization was done by mopac molecular orbital package method 34 35 later all the inhibitors were converted topdb format in open babel software 36 and submitted to molecular docking studies crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 3clpro was retrieved from pdb pdb id 6y2g the protein macromolecule sars-cov-2 3clpro optimization was carried out in ucsf chimera software 31 37 38 by adding polar hydrogen atoms removing water molecules implying amber parameters followed by minimization with the mmtk method in 500 steps with a step size of 002  sars-cov-2 3clpro contained chain a and b of 306 amino acids sequence length chain a of pdb id 6y2g containing alpha-ketoamide o6k inhibitor was used for identification of substrate binding site the docking of sars-cov-2 3clpro specific pharmacological inhibitors into the catalytic site was performed by the autodock 42 program 39 the alpha-ketoamide o6k inhibitor was extracted from the sars-cov-2 3clpro protein the polar hydrogen atoms were added the non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged gasteiger charges were assigned and solvation parameters were added to the protease sars-cov-2 3clpro protein the protonation state for all inhibitors and o6k were set to physiological ph and rotatable bonds of the ligands were set to be free the autogrid program was also used to generate grid maps cys145 residue in the sars-cov-2 3clpro protein was selected with grid box dimensions of 40  40  40  formed around the cys145 protease residue which is present in the substrate binding site protein rigid docking was performed using the empirical free energy function together with the lamarckian genetic algorithm lga 40 lga default parameters were used in each docking procedure and 10 different poses were calculated chimera and discovery studio ds visualizer25 31 software were used for visualisation and calculation of proteinligand interactions a total of 9761 sars-cov-2 genomes were retrieved from the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg that contain 3 sequences from bat betacoronavirus and 9 sequences from malayan pangolin manis javanica additional file 1 table s1 out of 9761 genome sequences 2301 complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were selected randomly aligned and compared with wuhan sars-cov-2 nc0455122 reference genome we have divided our dataset into 6 different geographic areas europe 2031 north america 2113 asia 3537 oceania 2086 south america 1663 and africa 1035 the european group comprises of sars-cov-2 infected patient data from the following countries austria belgium czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany greece hungary iceland ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg netherlands poland portugal slovakia slovenia spain sweden switzerland and united kingdom the north american group contains genomes from the united states and canada the asian group comprises genomes obtained from patients located in china indonesia pakistan philippines taiwan turkey kuwait georgia south korea japan iran india thailand hong kong malaysia singapore and vietnam the oceanian group comprises genomes from australia and new zealand south america includes brazil peru chile colombia argentina and ecuador fig 2ac sequences from bat-sars-cov and pangolin-sars-cov were aligned and compared to the wuhan sars-cov-2 nc0455122 as a reference genome to determine the evolutionary relationship among bat-cov pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 we estimated a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence bat-sars-cov and sars-cov-2 were grouped together and were observed to share  96 similarity whereas the pangolin-sars-cov was closest evolutionary ancestor fig 2d isolate of human wuhan sars-cov-2 nc0455122 shared 8598 identity with pangolin-sars-cov which suggests that pangolin may be associated with sars-cov-2 evolution or subsequent outbreak 41 42 recently pachetti et al 43 has reported eight novel recurrent mutations of sars-cov-2 that have been identified in positions 1397 2891 14408 17746 17857 18060 23403 and 28881 in asian oceanic european and north american outbreaks however sars-cov-2 mutations from south american and african patient isolates are not yet reported we confirmed the occurrence of these mutations in south americans and africans located at positions 3036 8782 1108314408 23403 28144 and 28881 as reported in previous literature 43 our study highlights the presence of additional conserved mutations in the south american and african communities considering only those occurring  5 times in our database we report here 12 new mutations that have evolved in the sars-cov2 sequence in south american and african populations these are located at positions 14805 25563 26144 28882 28883 9477 28657 28863 1059 15324 28878 and 29742 sites the high tendency of the virus to demonstrate genetic variability is evident from the fact that even within these variants three variations 9477 nsp4 28657 and 28863 orf9 structural protein were uniquely identified in isolates from south american patients while four novel mutations viz 1059 nsp2 15324 rdrp 28878 orf9 structural protein and 29742 stem-loop ii-like motif were detected only in isolates from african patient samples fig 3b interestingly some mutations were identified to be common between these two separate sets of sequences that have been reported from the two distinct geographical locations viz 14805 25563 26144 28882 and 28883 belonging to gene orf1ab 14805 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp orf3a 25563 and 26144 orf3a protein and orf9 n gene 28882 and 28883 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein sequences respectively fig 3a an interesting finding of this analysis is the concurrence of 14805 mutation with 14808 mutation in the same locus this double point mutation was observed in rdrp genome from isolates of both south american and african patients in contrast 2888228883 mutation locus corresponded with another previously reported mutation 28881 and this triple point mutation was also present in both the south american and african genomic sequences identification of point mutations at the same locus indicates the high susceptibility of these genetic regions to change as the virus evolves for its actions single-stranded sars-cov-2 rna viral genome encodes two protease polyproteins i papain-like cysteine-protease plpro and ii the chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known as 3c-like protease 3clpro 3clpro which is a main protease and therefore important in order to examine the incidence of any mutation in sars-cov-2 3clpro multiple sequence alignment of the sars-cov-2 genome collected from patients in six different geographical locations exhibited 100 similarity and no discernible variations in sequences obtained from diverse geographical regions for this enzyme sars and sars-cov-2 complete genomes were collected from ncbi genbank database nc004718 and nc045512 protease nucleotide sequences were extracted from sars nc004718 and were aligned with sars-cov-2 nc045512 clustal omega alignment of 918 sars nucleotides showed around 95 similarity with sars-cov-2 additional file 2 table s2 higher amino acid sequence identity was also observed in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 main protease 3clpro derived from wuhan and us patients sars-cov and sars-cov-2 3clpro showed highly conserved region in both the catalytic sites his41 and cys145 44 and substrate binding region of the enzyme 163-167 and 187-192 45 fig 4a inferring that these proteases exhibit high similarities furthermore 12 variant positions thr35val ala46ser ser65asn leu86val arg88lys ser94ala his134phe lys180asn leu202val ala267ser thr285ala and ile286leu were observed in sars-cov-2 3clpro fig 4b c the effects of mutations and potential resultant amino acids on sars-cov-2 3clpro structure are expected to conserve the polarity and hydrophobicity except when the resulting amino acid is leucine at 286 position however it is important to mention that these 12 variants are not present in catalytic and substrate binding regions which are involved in critical proteolytic activity of the sars-cov-2 protease molecule the sars-cov-2 3clpro receptor binding pocket was determined by superimposing sars and sars-cov-2 3clpro with their respective inhibitors fig 4 interestingly needleman-wunsch alignment algorithm and blosum-62 matrix analysis revealed 9444 sequence identity between sars fig 5a grey and sars-cov-2 3clpro fig 5a cyan cys-his catalytic dyad cys145 and his41 comprises the active catalytic binding site in sars-cov-2 3clpro fig 5a b and indicated the strong possibility that intended pharmacological inhibitors of sars-cov-2 3clpro may also suppress the activity of sars-cov-2 3clpro viral enzymes docking protocol for the autodock 42 program was optimized by extracting and re-docking the alpha-ketoamide inhibitor named o6k in the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 3clpro the lowest binding energy  645 kcalmol and 1872 m inhibitory constant ki was predicted for alpha-ketoamide inhibitor shown in table 1 re-docking of o6k inhibitor occupied the similar docking pose in the sars-cov-2 3clpro catalytic dyad active site as previously reported in the crystal structure pdb id 6y2g fig 5c d seven flavonoids and biflavonoid three anti-malarial compounds seven anti-viral drugs and three vitamin molecules were subjected to automated docking within the active site of sars-cov-2 3clpro catalytic-dyad the superimposition of all docked flavones and biflavones fig 6a anti-malarial drugs fig 6b anti-viral drugs fig 6c and vitamins fig 6d are shown in fig 6 and various binding parameter have been tabulated in detail in table 2 amentaflavone a biflavonoid showed the highest binding energy  849 kcalmol implicating a strong affinity with sars-cov-2 3clpro this corresponded with previously reported enzyme inhibitory assays with amentaflavone that showed the highest ic50 value at low concentrations of the molecule 83  12 m 46 however bilobetin demonstrated the lowest ic50 value at a higher concentration of 723  45 m in sars-cov enzyme activity assays 46 in contrast our docking studies revealed that bilobetin predicted almost comparable binding energy with that of amentaflavone  829 kcalmol suggesting that mutation in sars-cov-2 3clpro could potentially disrupt hydrogen bonding or induce some conformational change that could result in alterations in the binding site thus affecting inhibitor interactions with the enzyme active site residues amentaflavone showed h-bond interactions with the catalytic dyad residues cys145 and his41 as well as noteworthy interactions with the sars-cov-2 3clpro residues thr26 ser46 ser144 and glu166 whereas his164 and gln189 amino acids contributed to the hydrophobic interactions for the sars-cov-2 3clpro inhibitors fig 7a three antimalarial drugs were then selected to study their inhibitory actions on sars-cov-2 3clpro we found artemisinin a natural compound derived from chinese herb artemisia annua produces the highest docking score  640 kcalmol as compared to o6k chloroquine -495 kcalmol and hydroxychloroquine  577 kcalmol anti-malarial molecules importantly artemisinin has demonstrated broad anti-viral activity against human cytomegalovirus herpes simplex virus type 1 epstein-barr virus hepatitis b virus hepatitis c virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus 47 artemisinin was shown to exhibit hydrogen bonding with his41 leu141 asn142 gly143 ser144 and glu166 sars-cov-2 3clpro amino-acid residues fig 7b amongst the seven antiviral drugs ritonavir showed the highest binding energy -745 kcalmol and lowest inhibitory constant ki value 349 m ritonavir produced hydrogen bond interactions with thr26 his41 and cys145 sars-cov-2 amino acids fig 7c a combination of two hiv-1 protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir were given to critically ill sars-cov 2 infected patients 48 however the combination therapy of lopinavir and ritonavir was also stopped early in 13 patients total recruitment 99 patients due to associated gastrointestinal adverse events 48 the severity of antiviral therapy adverse events has led researchers to explore the potential of macro- micro- and phytonutrients that can potentially promote an immune response and suppress viral induced effects vitamins are known to modulate the host immune functions by providing anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory activity 49 50 therefore we selected vitamins ascorbic acid vitamin c cholecalciferol vitamin d and alpha-tocopherol vitamin e to investigate their potential interactions with the enzyme sars-cov-2 3clpro our docking results interestingly showed that vitamin d has the lowest binding energy and ki  775 kcalmol and 208 m respectively as compared to vitamin c and vitamin e amino acid residues thr24 thr26 his41 and cys145 of sars-cov-2 3clpro showed hydrogen bond formation with vitamin d fig 7d amino acid thr is extensively involved in intracellular signalling changes through phosphorylation changes and here we observed that cholecalciferol formed a strong hydrogen bond with thr residues and could potentially block the phosphorylation of thr residue in sars-cov-2 3clpro enzyme there is evidence that serious sars-cov-2 infected cases have reported severe vitamin d deficiency and thus therapeutic concentrations of this molecule could potentially be used clinically in sars-cov-2 cases 51 52 the novel coronavirus termed ncovid-19 is now known as the third large-scale epidemic coronavirus introduced into the human population in the twenty-first century at the time of writing more than 367 million confirmed cases globally with nearly 250000 deaths had been reported by who clinically ncovid-19 is similar to sars regarding its presentation however the sheer capacity and speed of which ncovid-19 has spread to global pandemic levels have left researchers asking what makes this outbreak so similar in presentation yet so different in its virulence to previous coronaviruses genome sequence analysis has looked to investigate similarities in the phylogeny of sars-cov-2 which like sars and mers have now placed it in the betacoronavirus genus 53 the known severe and often fatal pathogenicity of betacoronaviruses has been highlighted in these previous epidemics and has reported higher transmission and pathogenicity than the milder and lesser known a-covs which are often compared to the common cold 54 our study further compares the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 using clustal omega alignment to show that of 918 sars nucleotides there was a similarity of approximately 95 furthermore we report high amino acid sequence identity in both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 main protease 3clpro which regulates coronavirus replication complexes 55 such highly conserved regions in both catalytic sites and the substrate binding regions of the enzymes has also been validated previously in studies by huang et al and muramatsu et al 44 45 while this region provides an attractive target for anti-viral drug design it also can begin to elucidate on viral origins and uncover its ease in transmission based on more recent virus genome sequencing results and evolutionary analysis the origins and transmission of ncovid-19 have uncovered bats as the natural host of the virus origins 42 as such studies earlier this year queried the unknown intermediate host between bats and humans and recent studies have pointed this to pangolins 41 42 to determine the extent of the evolutionary relationship between bat-cov pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 we corroborate that based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence bat-sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are grouped together and share  96 similarity with pangolin-sars-cov as the closest evolutionary ancestor 41 42 furthermore we report that in isolates of human wuhan sars-cov-2 there is an 8598 similarity in identity to pangolin-sars-cov which suggests that pangolin may be associated with the evolution of subsequent outbreaks of covid-19 regarding ncovid-19 and its similarity in transmission to sars-cov recent studies have also demonstrated that transmission occurs via the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 42 this may indicate why sars-cov-2 has often led to severe and in many cases fatal respiratory tract infections like its two sar-cov predecessors since the sars-cov epidemic of 2002 was also known to use the ace2 receptor to infect humans 56 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from ncovid-19 patients have shown that ace2 is widely distributed in the lower respiratory tracts of humans 42 furthermore the virion s-glycoproteins expressed on the surface of coronaviruses adhere to ace2 receptors on human cells 57 this location provides a target for uncovering the mechanistic insights into the severity of the disease and how this region has assisted in the zoonosis of sars-cov-2 specifically additionally mutations in the genomic structure of sars-cov-2 also might elucidate on the aggressiveness and pathogenicity of the viruses which may in turn help to explain why some strains are evolutionarily much more virulent and contagious angeletti et al have described mutations in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 and nsp3 proteins the former possibly accounting for the high virulence and contagion while the latter suggesting a mechanism that differentiates ncovid-19 from sars-cov 58 our studies build on this knowledge and assist to begin to identify the sub-clinical causes for the virulence and unique pandemic pattern of this outbreak by identifying the evolving mutations from region to region additionally previous studies by pachetti et al have reported novel recurrent mutations of the sars-cov-2 and our study corroborates these mutations in south america and africa regions 43 drug discovery and vaccine development against sars-cov-2 infection require time and lengthy processes however drug repurposing represents an alternative strategy in the current scenario some of these antivirals are currently being used clinically in sars-cov-2 treatment including lopinavir 59 ritonavir 60 remdesivir 61 and oseltamivir 62 however in the clinical setting lopinavirritonavir a 3clpro and rdrp inhibitors showed no benefit in covid-19 adult patients 48 the double point mutation in rdrp gene identified in our study can potentially lead to a drug-resistance event moreover other classes of drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown antiviral properties by blocking viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors 63 we observed no differences in the sars-cov-2 main proteinase 3clpro genome sequences but important differences in sars-cov-2 3clpro with sars-cov protein underlining the extreme need for identification of inhibitors to target the viral life cycle it is not known whether these mutations induce any alterations in the gene transcription or localisation of affected proteins which can be investigated in near future using biochemical and immunological approaches 64 65 various theories have been proposed regarding the origin of highly virulent sars-cov-2 particle our analysis shows that bat-sars-cov shares  90 similarity with the sars-cov-2 however it is possible that the bat coronavirus infected another intermediate host such as pangolin which subsequently transmitted the virus to humans pangolin isolates do share sequence identity with sars-cov-2 genomes and could be an intermediate host we identified novel mutation hotspot regions from south american and african isolates of sars-cov-2 genome sequences interestingly double point mutations in rdrp at position 14805 and 14808 and triple point mutations in nucleocapsid protein at position 28881 28882 and 28883 were identified in both south american and african genomic sequences suggesting the vulnerability of these genetic loci to undergo change in addition a novel mutation pattern specifically oriented towards nucleocapsid phosphoprotein in both south american and african sequences was noted while novel orf3a and rdrp specific variants were observed particularly from african genomic sequences the potential effects of double and triple point mutations on translated proteins and the virulence of sars-cov-2 requires further investigations sars-cov-2 main proteinase 3clpro genome was observed to be conserved across all collected genomic sequences despite significant similarities in the sars-cov 3clpro structure with sars-cov protein sars-cov-2 3clpro revealed certain key differences which highlight the extreme need for identification of novel mechanism-based drugs to target the virus processing repurposed drugs including natural flavonoids and bioflavonoids antimalarial antiviral and vitamins-based compounds have previously been shown to be beneficial in several viral infections and outbreaks the novel data generated from this study enhances our knowledge of the fine molecular differences that differentiate sars-cov-2 virus sars-cov it also highlights the emerging variations in the viral genome across different populations as the virus evolves to local genetic and environmental factors these findings will likely play a key role in the development of mechanism-based and targeted therapeutic strategies to treat sars-cov-2 infection and reduce its virulence  a systematic review on use

 91 92 93 one of the examples of successful application of drug discovery approaches is drug repurposing of the traditional anti-malarial drugs aminoquinolines namely chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine fig 3
 both are synthetic anti-malarial drugs with rapid absorption chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are water soluble the latter is more soluble due to presence of hydroxyl group and possesses plasma half-life of 900 h and 1300 h respectively 94 during chronic treatment the drugs gets accumulated in tissues 95 the selected anti-malarial drugs have been used for last 70 years they are economic have proven safety profile and are categorized as essential medicines by world health organization who 96 aminoquinolines have effectively reduced viral replication in zika virus chikungunya virus sars-associated coronavirus cov and mers-cov 97 98 99 100 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has shown inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication 101 clinical trials have demonstrated the effective role of chloroquine phosphate dose 500 mgday against covid-19 102 the n-hydroxyethyl substituted derivative of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine is less toxic more soluble and has similar activity towards covid-19 inhibition there is continuous requirement to explore the molecular mechanism towards underlying antiviral action and clinical benefits of aminoquinolines and the toxicity profile the detailed outcomes will help to design the randomized clinical trials 95103 104 105 106 107 the present manuscript provides a systematic review of mechanism of action efficacy and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 for viral replication a stable acidic ph of endosomes lysosomes golgi complex of host is required the bioaccumulation properties of both the selected aimnoquinolines explain the antiviral mechanism of their action 108 chloroquine increases the ph of intracellular vacuoles in lysosomes it alters the catalysis of the protein degradation pathways through acidic hydrolases it also alters endosomal macromolecule synthesis and in golgi apparatus it affects post-translational modifications the antirheumatic response is produced by interfering with the antigen processing in macrophages and antigen-presenting cells 109 the mechanism involved for antiviral action is similar it decreases the ph and interferes with the viral fusion process in coronavirus chloroquine binds to the cellular receptors and changes the glycosylation 110 chloroquine possesses selective and reversible immunomodulatory effect through its action on human cd4 t-cells which is mediated by inhibition of jnk catalytic activity 109 hydroxychloroquine exerts similar mechanism of antiviral action and some of the key features are  i increase the ph ii modulation of activated immune cells iii downregulation of expression of toll-like receptors tlr iv downregulation of tlr-mediated signal transduction v decreased production of interleukin-6 vi reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators to control inflammation 105110111 the recent literature review helps to propose the possible mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine through three ways ie immunomodulatory effect zinc ionophore effect and binding with sialic acid 112 113 114 the three mechanisms are illustrated in fig 4
 when compared for pharmacological profile chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess equivalent anti-malarial activity the latter is preferred due to lower ocular toxicity 115 theoretically the antiviral activity for chloroqunie and hydroxychloroquine are similar but the reported clinical details for chloroquine are more in number 116 use of chloroquine is less due to some associated adverse effects and lack of availability in some countries in patients with covid-19 infection hydroxychloroquine is preferred as chloroquine when used in combination with lopinavir or ritonavir shows prolongation of the qt interval some of the other antiviral therapeutics that does not interfere with hydroxychloroquine is oseltamivir lopinavirritonavir robavirin interferons and immunoglobulins intravenous 117 the toxicological properties reported with use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are retinopathy neuromyopathy and cardiomyopathy both these drugs possess affinity for melanin and affect the macular cones the phagocytic activity of lysosomes is declined on the photoreceptors and they migrate towards central and peripheral regions as well as induces epithelial atrophy and irreversible alterations in photoreceptors 106 in the lysosomes hydroxychloroquine is protonated and accumulated due to its basic nature it inhibits the activity of lysosomal phospholipases causing vacuolization of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells 118 prolong use of hydroxychloroquine produces  i toxicity to retina tissue which may lead to irreversible retinopathy 119120 ii cardiotoxicity and cns toxicity with neuromyopathy symptoms and alterations in gastrointestinal tract 121 toxicity to liver cells genetic material 122 and genotoxicity 123124 studies have shown substantial increase in retinal toxicity with chronic treatment based on the hypothesis of bioaccumulation 125 some investigators report 2 incidences of retinopathy and more common in asian patients 126127 some studies failed to report cardiac complications and neuromyopathy and may be rare after long-term treatment 128129 the monitoring of side effects need to be continued even after discontinuation of treatment due to prolong half-life of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the side effects keratopathy maculopathy may be delayed the current anti-covid-19 therapeutic regimen suggests longer duration of treatment with chloroquine than that as anti-malarial drug thus close monitoring of the adverse reactions pharmacological effects poisoning and toxicological mechanisms to provide help to the worldwide clinical work 110 consideration of clinical outcomes is essential to be monitored to design safe and effective protocol with prevention of toxicological effects for therapeutic use of the antiviral aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine who has published a generic protocol to conduct randomized clinical trials for investigating the clinical role and safety of therapeutics for the treatment of covid-19 infection 130 as on 14 april 2020 approximately 961 clinical trials which are carrying on worldwide have been reported to who the essential ethical requirement is use of chloroquine in covid-19 patients with ethical trial approval or off-label timely availability of the clinical outputs to the biomedical fraternity is important considering the evolving outbreak and growing number of coivd-19 infected patients with availability of any specific licensed drug the use of chloroquine in the treatment of coivd-19 infection is considered by who as experimental in this regard use of chloroquine is associated with various concerns such as patient safety close monitoring of drug use etc the repurposing of the anti-malarial drugs need to follow ethical approaches and may raise concern about shortage of such drugs the outcomes of some of the reported in vivo in vitro and clinical studies carried globally have been documented here one by one approximately 100 clinical trials are in recruiting or pending approval and are ongoing at single or multiples centers with satisfactory primary outcomes but final outcomesresults are pending these are summarized in table 1 for ease of access to medical fraternityin vitro study of chloroquine were performed in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov with a multiplicity of infection 005 demonstrated effective reduction of viral replication ec90  690 m the antiviral effects are reproducible with standard dose with favorable tissue and lung penetration the proposed mechanism of viral inhibition involves increased ph in endosomes altered glycosylation of sars-cov cellular receptor and the synergistic action of immunomodulation properties 131the department of science and technology guangdong province and health commission of guangdong province reported a multicentric collaborative in vitro and clinical study use of chloroquine phosphate dose 500 mg twice a day for 10 days in mild moderate and severe sars-cov-2 pneumonia 132 the study included some advisories to monitor for history of drug contraindication blood testing for anemia thrombocytopenia or leucopenia serum electrolyte disturbances tests for hepatic and renal functioning routine electrocardiography and monitoring for visual and mental disturbances concurrent administration of some drugs should avoided including drugs which can prolong qt interval examples quinolones macrolides ondansetron anti-arrhythmic anti-depressant and antipsychotic drugsthe italian society of infectious and tropical disease lombardy section suggests administration of chloroquine 500 mg twice a day or hydroxychloroquine 200 mg per day for 10 days 5 to 20 days treatment depending on clinical severity 133another guideline as documented by the dutch center of disease control cdc recommended use of chloroquine to treat severe infections with requirement of oxygen therapy and optimal supportive care 134 the recommended dose for chloroquine base is 600 mg followed by 300 mg after 12 h on day 1 and 300 mg twice a day for 25 days and discontinuation of the treatment at day 5 to reduce the side effects 30 h half-life of chloroquine 500 mg of chloroquine phosphate  300 mg of chloroquine basein china more than two dozen clinical trials have been carried out for evaluating efficacy various anti-viral drugs in different disease severity to investigate dose and duration of treatment the studies have been coordinated by the chinese authorities through a prescribed regulating guideline 135 these trials are the first to report the characteristics and management of covid-19 infected patients but no details on use of chloroquine 136 137 138 139 140
 for therapeutic use of aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychoroquine the important aspects are  i it will be administered to millions of infected patients with covid-19 ii it will be administered to medical workers as preventive measure iii during acute approach against covid-19 higher dose will be administered as compared to use during the treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases 141 following points can be concluded and to be considered during the use of aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 infection ihistory of previous or ongoing use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in malaria amebiasis rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupusiihigher risk of development of retinopathy in asian patientsiiiperiodical monitoring of patients with vision problems cardiovascular problemsivto measure central and peripheral visual acuityvdrug interaction with kaolin clay and antacids reduces antiviral and anti-inflammatory actionviregular monitoring for symptoms like ocular pruritus and cardiac arrhythmiasviiaminoquinolines decreases activity of immunosupressants and antibioticsviiiother aminoquinoline analog mefloquine is associated with increased risk of convulsionixthe toxicity is associated with the dose calculated by real weight and therefore dose should be suitable for patients with potential high risk of adverse effects cumulative dose 203 mgkg body weightday is under high risk category 142
 in the absence of sufficient clinical data detailed information on safety adverse effects dose of aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine etc should be made available among health professionals who will dissipate it among patients the successful application of available resources needs to be grounded in practices to minimize risk of rigorous screening and dose calculation  drug repurposing to fight colistin and carbapenem-resistant bacteria lucie peyclit sophie baron alexandra jean-marc rolain   nowadays despite recent scientific progress infectious diseases must always be taken into consideration the world health organization who closely examines such concerns in order to have an effective health system world health organization 2018 for 50 years we have been confronted with the end of the golden age of antibiotic discovery while some antimicrobial substances have existed for years gould 2016 due to significant progress that has largely contributed to reducing the number of deaths from infectious diseases pharmaceutical companies have developed a decreasing interest in these drugs conly and johnston 2005 in addition the use of an antibiotic and the emergence of its resistance are inevitable and intrinsically linked mohr 2016 although this is not a new phenomenon but a natural one who analysis warns against this serious situation which is the impact nature and spread of global antimicrobial resistance global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system 2019 report early implementation these resistant bacteria are found in every kind of environment water animals humans plants and food rolain 2013 zenati et al 2016 bachiri et al 2017 tafoukt et al 2017 the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents and the spread of antibacterial resistance are among factors that lead to a high rate of resistance in clinical animals and even in environmental isolates roca et al 2015 bassetti et al 2017 partly because of drug pressure resistance can occur more easily and affect all types of antibiotics as for the last-line antibiotics used in human medicine drug for resistant bacterial infections biswas et al 2012 in recent years we have seen an increase in the use of carbapenems as a result of an increase in the carbapenem resistance of gram-negative bacteria gnb diene and rolain 2013 for example monaco et al showed in italy that among 191 clinical strains isolated from november 2013 to april 2014 178 93 klebsiella pneumoniae had kpc enzymes carbapenemases with 76 43 resistant to colistin monaco et al 2014 although the same situation has been reported with colistin olaitan et al 2014 it has received more attention last-line treatments may no longer be effective increasing the risk of spreading infections biswas et al 2012 to combat frequent epidemics and the challenge of rapid spread new alternatives to last resort treatments must be considered to avoid treatment failure as a result alternatives to antibiotics to treat resistant germs should be a priority bassetti et al 2017 the use of old drugs can be a solution like forgotten antibiotics polymyxins fosfomycin minocycline or mecillinam which are still used in clinical settings cassir et al 2014 there is also a renewed interest in antibiotic combinations to circumvent resistance lenhard et al 2016 for example the synergistic activity of sulfonamide-associated colistin was evaluated against colistin-resistant clinical bacteria okdah et al 2018 but non antibiotic solutions can also been considered as alternatives for the therapeutic management of infections aslam et al 2018 various studies showed that clostridium difficile can be inhibited using bacteriophages or several ongoing trials use antimicrobial peptides as alternatives or preventive treatments in the future aslam et al 2018 the fight to treat multi-drug resistant mdr infections must also include a change in mentality rolain and baquero denounced the fact that society does not accept the use of toxic but effective antibiotics in treatment of life-threatening infections but on the other hand society can tolerate potential toxicities of other drugs such as anti-cancer with the progress of medicine in the management of adverse reactions and the improved monitoring of antibiotic concentrations old drugs or dosages rejected due to their adverse effects have to be reconsidered rolain and baquero 2016 in this way one other promising alternative on which this review focuses is drug repurposing also called repositioning mercorelli et al 2018 this therapeutic shift is the subject of several studies in different pathologies including cancer sleire et al 2017 heart diseases sun et al 2018 alzheimers disease kim 2015 or depression ebada 2017 in infectiology repurposing studies are now being carried out torres et al 2016 soo et al 2017 dangelo et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 mir-canturri et al 2019 in general the most common bacteria are first tested or those most at risk or in a therapeutic deadlock if this review focuses on drug repurposing that have been tested on mdr bacteria it seems important to precise that resistance is rarely crossed and if a molecule is active on a specific species this compound will potentially be active regardless of its resistance mechanisms this is because this molecule affects a new target generally independent of the antibiotic target as we will see below with ciclopirox carlson-banning et al 2013 gallium goss et al 2018 and zidovudine elwell et al 1987 therefore it can expand the scope to combinations tested on sensitive gnb as for minocycline and polymyxin b tested with non-antibiotics drugs schneider et al 2017 it offers a diversified and still exploitable field of possibilities schneider et al 2017 for carbapenem and colistin-resistant isolates a few articles are published on this specificity for which we are striving to synthesize them the aim is thus to identify an innovative therapeutic strategy against these bacteria in a cost-effective and efficient way in this review we will define drug repurposing and its characteristics we will then make an inventory of what has already been published as a drug for reuse in general and in particular to address the problem of carbapenem and colistin-resistant bacteria finally we will see what prospects exist for this therapeutic strategy a drug class is assigned to a molecule to describe and group similary together drugs because of their therapeutic use their biochemical mechanism by their way of action or their chemical structure as defined by waksman in 1947 an antibiotic is a chemical substance produced by micro-organisms which has the capacity to inhibit the growth of and even to destroy bacteria and other micro-organisms mohr 2016 the current trend therefore seems to be moving away from this definition indeed in recent years drug repositioning seems to have been a promising field in drug discovery that identifies new therapeutic opportunities for existing drugs doan et al 2011 the common idea is that to accelerate discovery of new treatment using old drugs that could potentially treat disease for which the treatments used no longer work or when we no longer have therapeutic solutions must be used langedijk et al 2015 sir james black pharmacologist and nobel laureate said in 1888 the most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug chen et al 2016 it could help to overcome an initial bottleneck in drug development process it may therefore be a better compromise between risk and reward than other approaches to drug development ashburn and thor 2004 drug repurposing present real economic advantages all studies about structure pharmacological properties as bioavailability or safety profiles for example have already been conducted with these drugs it is possible to skip preclinical trials because toxicity and pharmacokinetic are already known and a certain hindsight has been taken for several years drugs can move directly to phase 2 to test their effectiveness mercorelli et al 2018 repurposing drugs can offer new pathways or targets to study new perspectives for curing diseases as many antibiotics already affect dna membrane or protein translation other pathways essential for bacterial growth remain available for activity of molecules such as assimilation pathways of essential compounds like sugars or amino acids combined strategies that reduce resistance can be used to achieve several targets that could affect bacterial metabolism mercorelli et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 moreover this method is favorable to academic or small laboratories because of disinterest of pharmaceutical industries without patents these industries do not see any fruitful interest in it because of rapid emerging resistance fernandes and martens 2017 and a narrower spectrum of activity zheng et al 2018 on the other hand this solution cannot be totally miraculous drug repurposing does not work all the time due to the high minimal inhibitory concentration mic mercorelli et al 2018 or inconsistent plasma concentrations tolerated in humans dose tested for this new indication is important and can lead to human toxicity zheng et al 2018 what society fears rolain and baquero 2016 concerning galenic an optimization of formulation can also be foreseen if a physico-chemical incompatibility is observed considered an innovative strategy doan et al 2011 three major methods can lead a drug to be repurposed as shown in figure 1 first phenotypic assay can be performed by high throughput and screening of commercial public pharmaceutical compound libraries jung et al 1997 kim 2015 these assays consist in classical broth microdilution to identify a hit torres et al 2016 once antibacterial activity is found mic assay is performed to confirm results according to clsi guidelines sun et al 2016b compared to other methods phenotypic tests have the advantage of being highly physiologically relevant because the effect is observed directly on bacteria zheng et al 2018 advances in genomics and bioinformatics modified drug repositioning approach it consists of in silico structure or mechanism-based assays that work with virtual databases this has been made possible through the prospective development of drug databases and activities the exchange of information on compounds in collaborative networks and the abundance of resources on the internet hodos et al 2016 these new calculation tools make it possible to analyse all the different data accumulated in the field that man alone cannot study because they are too complex this can ensure the understanding and prediction of molecules by generating hypotheses about biological mechanisms hodos et al 2016 limit to these approaches is that pathways targets or other data must be already known moreover false positive and toxicity are problematic issues found after identification of a hit mercorelli et al 2018 however for emerging diseases this could be a quick way to find an effective molecule as was done for the coronavirus in 2013 law et al 2013 the last approach is random discovery and can include all types of configurations indeed the side effects of one drug in one disease may be effective for another such as for the antidepressant bupropion reoriented as an anti-tobacco drug hodos et al 2016 it can be mere coincidence as sulfamides were known for antibacterial properties and finally also employed for antidiabetic ones deuil 1956 however these unexpected observations could also potentially be identified by informatics methods in view of knowledge of compound side effects hodos et al 2016 despite all these techniques if a molecule is identified it must then go through the steps of its clinical evaluation after finding a positive response to a new use if it does not sufficiently meet the criteria of efficacy safety pharmacodynamics non-toxicity combination studies with another drug may be considered in order to use it effectively drug combinations consist on an association of two or more drugs in order to enhance efficacy of therapeutic strategy and increase chances of clinical applications it broadens the spectrum of activity of useful antibiotics for example for serious infections requiring urgent and effective treatment zheng et al 2018 the use of two or more drugs has an impact on different targets increasing the impairment of microbial function and reducing the risk of resistance emergence zheng et al 2018 the main goal of drug association is to produce a synergistic effect effect produced by combination is greater than that achieved with any of the drugs used alone moreover if one compound has low activity another can potentiate and increase it this reduces the concentration of each individual molecule and can therefore be used at lower doses this is a real advantage when one knows toxicity of certain drugs sun et al 2016a zheng et al 2018 sun et al showed the use of drug combinations reduced toxicity it increased activity compared to a single therapy when cytotoxicity was proven allowing the use of some drugs in human medicine that were not conceivable on their own sun et al 2016a research in drug repurposing for combination with known antibiotics on carbapenem andor colistin-resistant bacteria has mainly been conducted in association with polymyxins drugs table 1 niclosamide an anthelmintic drug known to be active against most tapeworms seems to interact with the negatively charged outer membrane of colistin-resistant strains leading to a synergistic effect with colistin this effect was observed on 18 strains with 13 colistin-resistant a baumannii pmrb altered and 2 colistin-resistant k pneumoniae mgrb and pmrb altered ayerbe-algaba et al 2018 colistin combination therapy with selective estrogen receptor modulators serm as tamoxifen raloxifen and toremifen also exhibited good activity against polymyxin-resistant p aeruginosa k pneumoniae and a baumannii tested in-vitro concentrations could be achievable for human concentration hussein et al 2017 schneider et al 2017 in 2019 fluspirilene and bay 11-7082 have shown promising results by resensitizing a resistant a baumannii to overcome colistin resistance cheng et al 2019 regarding polymyxin b synergistic activity with mitotane an antineoplastic approved for carcinoma treatment was studied in-vitro on 10 strains including carbapenem or polymyxin-resistant gnb tests were also carried out on infections of mouse burn wounds which led to a promising result for the treatment of this type of infection tran et al 2018 using knowledge of the mechanisms of action an approach was also tested with some channel-blocking molecules indeed these efflux pump inhibitors did not have an effect on bacteria alone but combined with an antibiotic they demonstrated restoration of its activity the effect is more or less strong but as for neuroleptics prochlorperazine chlorpromazine promazine associated with meropenem appear to be effective against mdr a baumannii yang and chua 2013 otto et al showed a potential efficacy of 7 drugs including 3 antidepressants amitriptyline imipramine and sertraline and 4 antipsychotics chlorpromazine clonazepam haloperidol and levopromazine with polymyxin b against 20 tested gnb displaying various resistance mechanisms including carbapenemases otto et al 2019 only sertraline chlorpromazine and levopromazine had a synergism effect with polymyxin b against a baumannii e coli and k pneumoniae isolates among all non-antibiotics only spironolactone which had only a good efficacy against e coli isolates showed non-toxic levels of minimum concentration for synergy with polymyxin b otto et al 2019 these findings show that non-antibiotics molecules can be effective in combination but studies need to be pursued to develop association with effective concentrations that are clinically tolerated otto et al 2019 although some natural compounds are not fda-approved some may also be part of this process for which a compound is used in another known property the stilbene and polyphenol resveratrol is produced by various plants as grapes and blueberries and is known to have various antioxidant properties and chemopreventive activities in the bark from nauclea pobeguinii cameroonian researchers found this compound and tested it on gnb with mdr phenotypes it was active alone and in a synergy with streptomycin and ciprofloxacin seukep et al 2016 rossolini et al demonstrated in 2018 activity of resveratrol as an antimicrobial agent in combination with colistin on a panel of colistin-resistant chromosomic or plasmid resistance gnb cannatelli et al 2018 resveratrol seems to potentiate colistin activity and thus makes it possible to restore its action among different species and resistance pathways thus another natural compound pterostilbene derived from blueberries and grapes and known for its anticancer anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects appears to enhance polymyxin activity in vitro and in vivo zhou et al 2018 they demonstrated synergistic effects with colistin and with polymyxin b in mcr-1 positive strains by 8-fold reducing mic of polymyxin b with 32gml zhou et al 2018 pterostilbene could therefore affect mcr-1 function and restore antibacterial activity of polymyxin b in resistant isolates probably safe for human clinical practice and possibly not exerting selective pressure associated with the current atb it is therefore considered a good candidate for drug repurposing zhou et al 2018 lastly eugenol is a phenylpropanoid present in essential oil of many plants thirteen animal e coli strains with colistin resistance were subjected to mic time kill and checkerboard assays to evaluate combination between colistin and eugenol wang et al 2018 they observed that mcr-1 gene expression was down regulated by eugenol and suggested a possible binding between eugenol and mcr-1 protein wang et al 2018 all these molecules are still being tested in vitro or in clinical trials and none have yet received new indication for mdr infection treatment however research on drug repurposing is gaining new dynamism if we can refer to the number of annual publications in recent years figure 3 in conclusion this review therefore addresses two main aspects both the emerging drug repurposing strategy and resistance to last-line antibiotics carbapenems and colistin a new economic model is to be considered for antibiotic development because industries do not seem interested in this new strategy zheng et al 2018 indeed as antibiotics are not part of chronic treatment strategies this could not be as economically attractive conly and johnston 2005 this disinterest in antibiotics research is reflected in their absence in programs of future developments of major pharmaceutical companies spellberg et al 2004 start-ups or small companies on the other hand can see an interest in taking back antibiotics that have failed in clinical phases for example they believe they have different drug development strategies and do not require as many benefits to cover their costs compared to multinational pharmaceutical companies fernandes and martens 2017 however phase 3 clinical trials for new and repurposed drugs remain very expensive it is estimated between 40 million and 300 million of usd azvolinsky 2017 with such a budget this does not work in favor of small firms as for the question of how to treat bacterial resistance only one answer has not been found and the future offers us new possibilities various strategies are being considered as treatment using fecal microbiota davido et al 2017 antimicrobial peptides hashemi et al 2017 or bacteriophages parmar et al 2017 a streptomyces sp present in alkaline soil in ireland has been in the spotlight recently to inhibit growth of mdr bacteria terra et al 2018 which reminds of flemming discovery additionally the discovery and studies on the crisprcase9 system may suggest that it may be the ultimate weapon to fight infectious diseases and thus control antibiotic resistance doerflinger et al 2017 question of drug repurposing remains rather wide although this seems to be a better solution drug combinations can also lead to adverse interactions first toxic side effects can be increased then concerning compound galenic physico-chemical interactions and differences in stability solubility and conservation can result from the combination of two molecules making it incompatible formulation then becomes more complicated sun et al 2016a on the other hand we must change this vision where each drug belongs to only one box clinicians may have difficulty understanding why a biologist recommends the use of an anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory drug to treat their cystic fibrosis patients bacteremia rather than a last resort antibiotic they have always used communication in this sense remains essential between health professionals and clinical studies to prove these activities are critical however with current knowledge on drug repurposing as antibacterial agents and the problematic to find an alternative therapeutic in some situations screening of non-antibiotics in a  la carte way can be an issue figure 4 in the area of personalized medicine we could imagine a personalized antibiotic susceptibility testing in case of infection caused by a highly resistant bacterium if all last-line antibiotics have been tested and appear insufficient to successfully treat the patient testing non-antibiotic drugs that are potentially active on the pathogen alone or in combination with antibiotics could help clinicians use these drugs as previously reported by kadri et al these difficult-to-threat bacteria refer to bacteria that are resistant to all first-line antibiotics it represents less than 1 of isolates and those that are resistant to second-line antibiotics are even rare kadri et al 2018 this solution combined with monitoring of serum levels and adverse events such as dialysis of a nephrotoxic drug rolain and baquero 2016 could offer great potential for treating a patient with this mdr bacterium the problem remains to be able to routinely test a large panel of molecules in an automated reproducible and not too expensive way lp sb and j-mr drafted and revised the manuscript all authors read and approved the final manuscript the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  drug repurposing strategies for covid-19 suranga senanayake l   broad-spectrum antiviral agents bsaas that have been deemed safe-in-man through testing on early phase clinical trials have been touted as good drug repurposing candidates 1 andersen et al have recently summarized 31 potential candidates for covid-19 in a highly accessible database of 120 experimental investigational and approved agents 2 conceptually bsaas take advantage of the promiscuity of viral replicative mechanisms and host interactions to target two or more viral families 3 following the covid-19 outbreak in december 2019 a few existing bsaas have been rapidly introduced into clinical trials spanning phases ii though iv umifenovir is a membrane fusion inhibitor targeting viral entry and lopinavirritonavir is a drug combination targeting viral protease both approved for the indications of influenza and hiv they are currently being considered in different combinations in a phase iv clinical trial for pneumonia associated with covid-19 clinicaltrialsgov id nct04255017 4 at the phase iii level remdesivir a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor is under investigation for mild and moderate sars-cov-2 clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04252664 5 remdesivir has activity in preclinical studies against the species of coronaviridae implicated in sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 6 notably it has already been studied in a randomized controlled trial for ebola virus disease demonstrating an antiviral effect 7 other phase iii agents being evaluated in combination therapy for viral pneumonia interestingly include the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine based on promising in vitro data clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04261517 8 chloroquine in addition to its immunomodulating properties has been shown to have antiviral activity at entry and post-entry stages of the sars-cov-2 infection it can enhance the antiviral activity of remdesivir and potentially serve as a synergizer of bsaas 9 at more early stages the viral rna polymerase inhibitor favipiravir in combination is also on a phase ii clinical trial for novel coronavirus-associated pneumonia chinese clinical trial registry identifier chictr2000029544 10 finally preclinical studies of ribavirin ribonucleic analog has shown in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 9 one limitation of phenotypic screens is the low potency of hit compounds as single agents as their maximal tolerated dose is often subtherapeutic for the new indications being sought 11 one way to circumvent this issue is to evaluate two or more drugs acting on different cellular signaling pathways involving viral replication with minimal redundancy another strategy is high-throughput screening of compound libraries for synergistic combinations at the hostvirus interactome level for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases which may allow researchers to narrow down the spectrum of individual antimicrobials 31213 these strategies promise to address the often-weak activity of bsaas by improving efficacy while potentiating dose reductions reducing duration cost of the drug development pipeline lowering toxicity and minimizing emergence of secondary resistance a notion that will determine the effectiveness of this drug repurposing strategy is whether such agents will compare favorably with virus-specific vaccines or small molecules both options traditionally considered gold standards of modern drug development if one were to extrapolate the experience from precision oncology where targeted cancer therapies and immunotherapeutics have made major gains against cancer a broad-spectrum strategy will have fundamental flaws importantly the lack of specificity of bsaas may become implicated in the emergence of drug resistance and more virulent strains for example the nonstructural protein nsp14-exon together with its cofactor nsp10 of coronaviridae has been found to repair nucleotide mismatches caused by nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin thus potentially negating the antiviral effect of bsaas 14 as elegantly demonstrated by ferron et al the nsp14-exon of sars-cov forms part of a highly flexible complex with multienzymatic properties likely facilitating compensated low fidelity of replication what are viable strategies to circumvent this remarkable innate ability of coronaviridae to proofread their rna and maintain genomic integrity while allowing some degree of evolutionary freedom to mutate again high-throughput screening can come to the rescue here possibilities include compounds with affinity toward the nsp14-exon catalytic subunit or those with allosteric effects at critical sites with conserved residues causing conformational change of the entire viral rna repair complex therefore the hunt should now be on to identify an inhibitor of this viral nuclease further drug repurposing will have to compete with structure-based design of preventativetherapeutic vaccines and small molecules on efficacy and off-target toxicity turfs the cov spike glycoprotein used by sars-cov-2 at the atomic resolution and human ace2 enzyme as its port of cellular entry have now been determined these discoveries are hoped to spur rapid efforts to develop vaccines and antibodies however such processes typically take up to a decade and can be hindered by the potential for blunted antigenicity of epitopes due to genetic drift of the virus 1517 another important dimension in this quest for repurposed drugs involves patent protection issues under current national andor international regulations 18 a global health emergency of this magnitude calls for a bold international response at the governmental and political levels therefore the regulatory community must act fast to minimize any financial hurdles implicating private industry and update guidelines for drug licensure through repurposing if necessary it should not escape us that this is a vital behind-the-scene act while efforts are underway to seek new indications for existing compounds the urgently launched clinical trials worldwide on investigational medicinal products for the current covid-19 outbreak should read out within weeks to months we can anticipate the notion of drug repurposing for emerging viral diseases to be scrutinized based on these results at a deeper level this is a battle not only against covid-19 but for the very soul concept of new antimicrobials and their clinical indications one drug one virus versus one drug multiple viruses or multiple drugs one virus are the contenders 1920  revisiting potential druggable targets against sarscov2 and repurposing therapeutics under preclinical study and clinical trials a comprehensive review abdullah sohag al md hannan abdul sadaqur rahman motaher hossain mahmudul hasan md khan kawsar amena khatun raju dash md

pathologies such as immune dysfunction and multiorgan failure andersen rambaut lipkin holmes  garry 2020 forster forster renfrew  forster 2020 like other coronaviruses sarscov2 possesses several structural and nonstructural proteins that are implicated in crucial cell functions ashour elkhatib rahman  elshabrawy 2020 of the structural proteins spike glycoproteins facilitate the attachment of the virus to their host cells the helicase main protease mpro papainlike protease plpro rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp are among the nonstructural proteins that are critical for viral replication forster et al 2020 siu et al 2008 with their significant roles in the viral life cycle these proteins present promising pharmacological targets for developing potential therapeutics against sarscov2 infection targetbased drug discovery tdd is one of the most successful and efficient strategies to find the remedy of any disease an estimated 70 of the firstclass drugs approved by the united states food and drug administration in between 1999 to 2013 were based on tdd croston 2017 eder sedrani  wiesmann 2014 tdd is not only restricted to the discovery of small molecules as drug targets but also extends to protein biologics genetic materials and antibodies the advantages of targetbased strategies over phenotypic approaches include high throughput convenient and less expensive croston 2017 zheng thorne  mckew 2013 molecular pharmacology biochemistry genomics computational modeling structural biology system biology and mutational analysis are usually employed to carry out the tdd for the complete understanding of any drug candidate and also ensuring the effective therapeutics for upcoming days croston 2017 although research communities have responded rapidly still there is no vaccine or effective therapeutics for covid19 harrison 2020 some of the existing antiviral drugs from other viral diseases including remdesivir are being considered as repurposing medicine to treat covid19 patients which resulted in mixed outcomes gautret et al 2020 molina et al 2020 it is therefore crucial to focus on alternative rational strategies for the development of urgent therapeutics to control the ongoing pandemic developing new therapeutic drugs and vaccines requires a proper understanding of the disease the immune response pattern after infection and the pathogenesis of the virus to accelerate this effort we present a scoping review summarizing the potential drug targets and therapeutics under trials by critically analyzing all relevant published literature on this field this review would provide concrete evidence concerning the drug targets previous use of the drugs and early findings of possible drug mechanisms moreover our review would provide insightful evidence for future sarscov2 research and might support researchers to discover a potential remedy sarscov2 is a member of the betacoronavirus genera and possesses 16 nonstructural proteins nsp and four structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins the n protein clamps the ribonucleic acid rna genome whereas the s e and m proteins together shape the viral envelope and the glycoprotein spikes render coronaviruses to form their unique crownlike appearance figure 1a anthony et al 2017 ashour et al 2020 in addition to the knowledge on the structural makeup a critical understanding of the life cycle and pathogenesis of sarscov in general is essential to discover potential vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat sarscov and sarslike coronavirus slcov including sarscov2 infections in the future crucial steps of sarscov life cycle are therefore illustrated in figure 1b and also highlighted belowreceptor recognition is the first step of virus entry into the host cell that occurs by the recognition of the receptor by the spike protein of the virus first the receptorbinding domain rbd of s protein attaches with the host cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 s protein is then proteolytically cleaved by a type ii transmembrane protease tmprss2 resulting into two subunits called s1 and s2 where s2 is crucial for membrane fusion and virus entry glowacka et al 2011 holmes 2003 li 2015 li et al 2006 wan shang graham baric  li 2020 wong li moore choe  farzan 2004 splitting of the s protein by proteases is essential for

machinery of the host cell then the polyprotein is split into effector proteins by viral proteinases 3clpro and plpro resulting in a number of nsps including rdrp and helicase that form the

 two large overlapping replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab encoded by two linked ribosomal frameshift are hydrolyzed by an extensive proteolytic action of viral proteases fehr  perlman 2015 graham sparks eckerle sims  denison 2008 pillaiyar manickam namasivayam hayashi  jung 2016 one of the crucial viral proteases is the mpro also known as 3clike proteinase or nsp5 which is a homodimeric cysteine protease belonging to the coronavirus polyprotein group fan et al 2004 automatic cleavage of polyproteins leads to the generation of mpro which cleaves the large polyprotein 1ab at 11 cleavage sites to generate nsps the identification of cleaving sequence at most sites is leuglnser ala gly to release nsp4nsp16 pillaiyar et al 2016 yang et al 2005 zhang penninger li zhong  slutsky 2020 mpro directly mediates the maturation of nsps which is critical for the initiation of the sarscov2 replication cycle and could therefore be a potential druggable target zhang wu  zhang 2020 for instance pyridonecontaining ketoamides inhibited the mpro activity showing early promise for the development of antiviral drugs zhang et al 2020 moreover more than a hundred pdb structures of sarscov2 mpro have already been deposited at the rcsb database httpswwwrcsborg and more are being added regularly here most of the structures were elucidated by cryoelectron microscopy nmr or xray crystallography or even the highthroughput networkbased inhibitor screening or direct ligandbased study jin et al 2020 vuong et al 2020 while ligandbased inhibitors screening leads to the determination of complexed crystal structure of sarscov2 mpro this approach aids in the structureassisted drug design and highthroughput screening for potential inhibitors jin et al 2020 the inhibitors targeting sarscov2 mpro are virusspecific and therefore will not interfere with host cell proteases bzwka et al 2020 proteolytic enzymes play an essential role in viral replication and hence could be the target of choice for the development of effective therapy against viral infections plpro also termed as nsp 3 had been extensively studied for coronaviruses bezsantos et al 2015 lei et al 2014 ratia et al 2006 and the efficacy of plpro inhibitors such as chloroquine and formoterol have been investigated recently for the treatment of covid19 rimanshee amit vishal  mukesh 2020 wu et al 2020 plpro cleaves the nterminal part of the polyproteins producing mature nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 a process that is crucial for viral replication the cleavage specificity of plpro corresponds to the pattern rklrkggx moreover the enzyme acts as deubiquitinase that removes poly ubiquitin units from proteins tagged with them barretto et al 2005 lindner et al 2005 the deubiquitinase activity of plpro interferes nuclear import of interferonregulatory factor 3 and the phosphorylation thereby preventing the production of typei interferons such as ifn and ifn by the infected host cell and also helps in peptide substrate recognition barretto et al 2005 clementz et al 2010 devaraj et al 2007 frieman ratia johnston mesecar  baric 2009 ratia et al 2006 additionally plpro clears ubiquitin and interferonsensitive gene 15 from hostcell proteins a mechanism that aids coronaviruses to evade host innate immune responses finally the plpro has been reported to interfere with the nuclear factor b pathway which further assists sarscov to counteract the innate immune response of the infected cells clementz et al 2010 therefore pharmacological targeting of plpro by developing plpro inhibitors might constitute a potential therapeutic strategy that would be advantageous in not only preventing viral replication but also ensuring the normal regulation of signal networks in the infected cells rdrp also termed as nsp 12 is a pivotal enzyme of rna viruses including coronavirus that catalyzes the replication of rna from an rna template probably with the assistance of nsp7 and nsp8 as cofactors guo huang lin  lv 2020 kirchdoerfer  ward 2019 subissi et al 2014 venkataraman prasad  selvarajan 2018 a protein complex consisting of nsp 7 nsp 8 and nsp 12 of sarscov2 is related to that of sarscov with a rootmeansquare deviation value of 082 for 1078 c atoms gao et al 2020 rdrp protein of sarscov2 and sarscov share 96 amino acid sequence identity and 82 sequence identity at their genomic rna level morse lalonde xu  liu 2020 the rdrp of sarscov2 contains a large and deep groove as an active site for the polymerization of rna residues that show variations between the sarscov2 and sarscov rdrps are mostly distal to this active site this high sequence conservation and structural homogeneity of rdrp in coronaviruses suggest that nucleotide analogs developed for the sarscov rdrp are likely to be effective against the sarscov2 rdrp morse et al 2020 previously published literature provides convincing evidence that rdrp could be a druggable target for the development of potent therapy against sarscov2 infection kandeel ibrahim fayez  alnazawi 2020 lung et al 2020 which includes nucleotide analog targeting rdrp deval jin chuang  kao 2017 gordon et al 2020 stephen  lin 2018 tchesnokov feng porter  gtte 2019 remdesivir gs5734 a prodrug and adenosine analog can be incorporated into nascent viral rna and subsequently inhibit the rdrp siegel et al 2017 furthermore remdesivir showed high considerable efficacy in controlling sarscov2 infection in a recent in vitro study wang et al 2020 dn4hydroxycytidine a ribonucleoside analog also inhibits sarscov2 replication as evidenced by reducing viral genomic rna sheahan et al 2020 sarscov helicase nsp13 is one of the 16 nsps generated after the proteolytic cleavage of two large polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab this helicase being one of the components of the replicasetranscriptase complex plays significant roles in the life cycle of sarscov marra et al 2003 subissi et al 2014 which constitutes the basis of targeting this enzyme for the development of potential antiviral agent helicases are motor proteins that unwind doublestranded nucleic acids into two singlestrands during replication adedeji et al 2014 shum  tanner 2008 moreover nsp13 nterminus carries 26 cysteines where 14 positions are highly conserved and assumed to possess a binuclear zn2binding cluster seybert et al 2005 importantly an antiviral compound bananin which is an adamantane derivative has been reported to inhibit helicase activities thereby preventing the replication of sarscov  tanner et al 2003 and can also be evaluated against sarscov2 the spike protein s giving a crownlike appearance to virion surface render diverse molecular actions that usually mediates the coronavirus entry into the specific host belouzard chu  whittaker 2009 the spike protein of sarscov and sarscov2 shares 76 amino acid identity however sarscov2 s protein binds 10 times more strongly than sarscov s protein to their common host cell receptor du et al 2009 hoffmann et al 2020 li 2016 tortorici et al 2019 wrapp et al 2020 heavily glycosylated the spike protein possesses a large ectodomain a singlepass transmembrane anchor and a short intracellular tail li 2016 the ectodomain consists of a receptorbinding subunit s1 and a membranefusion subunit s2 broer boson spaan cosset  corver 2006 li 2016 during virus entry the s1 subunit recognizes and interacts to host receptors and further conformational changes in the s2 subunit assist the fusion between the viral envelope protein and the host cell membrane du et al 2009 li 2016 tortorici et al 2019 s1 subunit has two major domains the nterminal domain ntd and the cterminal domain ctd depending on the coronavirus type either ctd or ntd can function as the rbd and bind with diverse proteins and sugars li 2016 notably sarscov and merscov utilize ctd to bind their receptors kubo yamada  taguchi 1994 li et al 2005 ou et al 2020 n wang et al 2013 then the proteases found in the cellular environment cause the cleavage of s proteins which ensures viral fusion sarscov2 possesses a furin cleavage site between s1 and s2 subunit that permits efficient cleavage by proteases including furin that determines viral infectivity and host range andersen et al 2020 coutard et al 2020 ou et al 2020 walls et al 2020 the s protein of the sarscov2 contains a furinlike cleavage site which is absent in other coronaviruses of the same clade coutard et al 2020 the s protein also activates the immune response of the host cell toward coronaviruses dosch mahajan  collins 2009 walls et al 2020 since the s protein of coronaviruses is reported for their vital associations with initial receptor binding and other critical membrane fusion steps they could be putative targets for blocking the infection prior studies revealed that peptide inhibitors to sarscov2 s protein provide promising avenues for sarscov2 treatment by blocking the s protein interaction with ace2 and thus efficiently preclude the virus entry into human cells moreover these inhibitors can be used as inhaled therapeutics preventing the virus activation in the lungs ou et al 2020 walls et al 2020 recently wan et al 2020 and tai et al 2020 sequenced and characterized rbd of sarscov2 including its receptorbinding motif rbm that directly associates with ace2 they also identified some important amino acid residues in sarscov2 rbm especially gln493 which facilitates the interactions with human ace2 and reveals the high capacity of sarscov2 human infection moreover other crucial amino acid residues in sarscov2 rbm particularly asn501 contributed sarscov2 gaining some ability for humantohuman transmission tai et al 2020 wan et al 2020 it was also found that five important amino acids of rbd are conserved in pangolincov and sarscov2 zhang lin et al 2020 these findings would give valuable information for finding antigens with improved sensitivity for sarscov2 serological detection and vaccine development e protein of coronavirus is a short polypeptide integral membrane protein that has been involved with different steps of the life cycle of the virus such as assembly budding envelope formation and pathogenesis masters 2006 it has been reported that the absence or inactivation of e protein could impact either virion morphology or tropism khattari et al 2006 pervushin et al 2009 e proteins of coronaviruses have shown cationselective ion channel activity and thus have membrane permeabilizing property wilson mckinlay gage  ewart 2004 sarscovs lacking e protein show lower viral titer immature and inefficient progenies kuo hurst  masters 2007 thereby recommending e protein a suitable drug target to prevent viral replication and infection ace2 is a type i membrane protein which is expressed in the heart lungs kidneys and intestine an nterminal peptidase domain pd and a c terminal collectrinlike domain cld are usually found in a fulllength ace2 donoghue et al 2000 h zhang et al 2001 a recent report demonstrated that the ectodomain of the sarscov2s protein interacts with the pd of ace2 wrapp et al 2020 like sarscov the sarscov2 virus exploits the ace2 receptor to gain entry into host cells human cellderived proteases cleave sarscov2 s protein into s1 and s2 where s1 initially interacts its receptor molecule ace2 and the other fragment s2 further leads to the membrane fusion after the cleavage by a human cell surface serine protease tmprss2 hoffmann et al 2020 these findings provide valuable insights into the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection the s protein of sarscov2 is approximately 10 to 20fold more likely to bind to human ace2 protein the s protein of sarscov wrapp et al 2020 this increase in affinity might have facilitated a more favorable persontoperson transmission of the sarscov2 infection than the sarscov hoffmann et al 2020 ace2 can thus act as a unique adhesion protein molecule for sarscov2 infection and be a promising drug target for the prevention of sarscov2 infection disrupting the interaction between spike protein and ace2 might therefore be a possible way of developing a drug against sarscov2 a phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trial of human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 a 23mer peptide fragment was carried out recently and suggested to use for the treatment of covid19 khan et al 2017 zhang penninger et al 2020 sarscov2 infected veroe6 lines were incubated with hrsace2 and found that hrsace2 can preclude the early entrance of sarscov2 infections in host cells perhaps by binding with rbd of s protein monteil et al 2020 although the ace2 is available in the vascular endothelial cells of all organs the lungs are more susceptible to sarscov infection hamming et al 2004 this phenomenon strengthens the possibility of other factors associated with the actual pathogenesis of sarscov2 one such factor which accounts for the viral entry into host cells is tmprss2 a wellknown human alveolar and airway protease shulla et al 2011 tmprss11a a tmprss2 related protein has been found to cleave sarscov s protein and to moderately accelerate viral infections kam et al 2009 tmprss2 probably facilitates viral pathogenesis and transmission in two ways first tmprss2 might activate sarscov s protein for viruscell and cellcell fusion second tmprss2 might protect viral recognition by different neutralizing antibodies of the host glowacka et al 2011 evidence suggests that the entry of sarscov2 into host cells requires both ace2 and tmprss2 hoffmann et al 2020 thereby suggesting that tmprss2 might be a potential drug target matsuyama et al 2020 showed that a tmprss2expressing in veroe6 cell line is highly susceptible to sarscov2 infection displaying the critical role of tmprss2 in the pathogenesis of this viral disease previously bromhexine hydrochloride an fda approved component in mucolytic cough suppressants showed specific inhibition on tmprss2 with no adverse effect in prostate cancer patients and reduction of the progression of metastasis lucas et al 2014 bromhexine hydrochloride might be repurposed as a tmprss2 inhibitor for preventing sarscov2 infection as well hoffmann et al 2020 sarscov2 causes imbalanced and exuberant immune responses termed as cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm which triggers lung impairment and reduces the survival of the infected patients pedersen  ho 2020 tisoncik et al 2012 the inflammatory cytokines are usually produced by different macrophages which are associated with cytokine storm luo et al 2020 pedersen  ho 2020 sarscov2 significantly increases levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as il6 il10 and tnf in infected patients channappanavar et al 2016 diao et al 2020 nikolichzugich et al 2020 furthermore sarscov2 induced activation of a cluster of differentiation four positive cd4 t cells stimulate the generation of t helper cells and secrete interleukin il6 and granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor gmcsf gmcsf triggers monocytes to further release of il6 and other factors resulting in the generation of a cytokine storm this cytokine storm results in acute respiratory distress syndrome multiple organ failure and even death chen zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 targeted immunomodulation to decrease cytokine storm might be a feasible option to reduce pulmonary inflammation and mortality since only antiviral candidates may not be enough to combat such cytokine storm or complications in the respiratory tract identifying effective targets for immune therapeutics along with antiviral agents could be a potential strategy preliminary results from a study suggest that hydroxychloroquine might have anticytokine storm properties yao et al 2020 additionally lenziluman has been reported to be protective against cytokine storm and neurotoxicity in mouse models furthermore lenzilumab an antigmcsf monoclonal antibody can be considered as a viable therapeutic option as covid19 patients sterner et al 2019 the innate immune response itself without the association of cd8 t cells and antibodies is capable of controlling sarscov frieman heise  baric 2008 nk cells are the part of innate lymphocyte subsets that mediate antitumor and antiviral responses and therefore have the potential for clinical use abel yang thakar  malarkannan 2018 previous studies showed that nk cells showed significant roles in mitigating of sarscov chen et al 2010 national research project for sars nsps 2004 recent epidemiological studies showed that sarscov2 infection in children is less frequent and lethal compared to that of adults which might be due to the increased lymphocyte count especially nk cells and trained immunity in children cristiani et al 2020 therefore the approaches focused on valorizing the innate antiviral immune responses are a possible way to find a remedy against sarscov2 arabinoxylan treatment resulted in the upregulation of nk cells against neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo studies prezmartnez et al 2015 arabinoxylan therefore possesses potentiality for the treatment of covid19 patients however clinical trials are needed to determine its effectivity autophagy is a natural mechanism of a cell which ensures the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by lysosomal catabolic action leading the degradation and recycling of intracellular endogenous macromolecules abnormal proteins and damaged organelles and exogenous viruses and bacteria particles galluzzi et al 2017 levine  klionsky 2004 some viruses have developed strategies to escape autophagic degradation and use host autophagy machinery for their selfreplication dong dong  levine 2013 the significance of the autophagy process and its therapeutic development for sarscov merscov and sarscov2 are reviewed by yang  shen 2020 a recent study showed that merscov halts the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes whereas inhibitors like sphase kinaseassociated protein 2 induced autophagy which leads to the reduction of the replication of merscov gassen et al 2019 thus it seems that a considerable relationship exists between the autophagy machinery and coronavirus infections therefore these relationships need to be elucidated in sarscov2 to understand disease prognosis and also to enhance autophagocytosis as a possible treatment corridor as virus entry is a crucial step for the pathogenesis of the covid19 we provide a comprehensive list of repurposed drugschemicals that have been reported to block viral entry via different mechanisms table 1 monotherapy or combined therapy of these drugs are in preclinical phase 1 phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials hoffmann et al 2020 showed that camostat mesylate interferes with tmprss2mediated viral entry thus reduces the severity of the covid19 disease similarly arbidol an antiviral that inhibits the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus and blocks the entry into the cell is recommended to use against influenza viruses and arboviruses kadam  wilson 2017 wang et al 2004 an open prospectiveretrospective randomized controlled cohort study is underway at tongji hospital china to study the safety and efficacy of arbidol hydrochloride and arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomization in humans table 1 in this study the interventional subjects will be given a standard supportive therapy with arbidol hydrochloride 02 g three times a day or arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon pegifn2b atomization 45 g nct04254874 trials with arbidol hydrochloride along with other drugs are also undergoing at ruijin hospital china and tongji hospital china nct04260594 nct04255017 moreover a recent study has demonstrated that a fusion protein made of rhace2 and an fc fragment crystalization region of the human immunoglobulin igg1 shows highaffinity binding to the receptorbinding domain of sarscov2 and potently neutralized sarscov2 in vitro which provides a basis for further drug development lei et al 2020 monteil et al 2020 this fusion protein can be considered for further studies in animals and humans to see its effectiveness moreover s proteinspecific monoclonal antibodies can be generated to neutralize the spike protein which may lead to the inhibition of viral entry recently tian et al 2020 identified a monoclonal antibody cr3022 which binds with the rbd of the spike protein of sarscov2 in vitro cr3022 therefore might be a potential drug candidate against sarscov2 infection despite the role of ace2 in viral entry targeting interruption of ace2 may not be the best strategy to prevent sarscov2 guo et al 2020 because ace2 also maintains blood pressure so the entry inhibition strategy must be pathogenspecific rather than hostspecific further studies should be carried out to discover potential entry inhibitors that block that viral entry without disturbing the maintenance of the blood pressure some other potential therapeutics that block the virus entry into target cells are summarized in tables 1 and 2 we have already discussed above the role of endosomallysosomal acidification and the role of their acidic phdependent proteases in the virus life cycle yang  shen 2020 the inhibition of this pathway might be a potential therapeutic strategy several therapeutics such as chloroquine cq a wellstudied lysosomotropic antimalarial drug and its derivatives hydroxychloroquine and colchicine would be an option for blocking this target cq effectively blocks viral progression by raising endosomal ph needed for membrane fusion between the host cell and viral candidates and releasing rna from endosomes savarino boelaert cassone majori  cauda 2003 although cq and hydroxychloroquine were found to be effective against sarscov2 gautret et al 2020 wang et al 2020 several recent evidence claimed some unprecedented effects a recent study reported that hydroxychloroquine either alone or in combination with azithromycin showed no positive outcome in patients with covid19 magagnoli et al 2020 instead was linked with increased overall mortality 278 in hydroxychloroquine and 221 in hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin versus 114 in the control group a multinational observational realworld study of patients with covid19 also claimed that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine showed no evidence of benefit rather it was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for inhospital death with covid19 mehra desai ruschitzka  patel 2020 moreover a recent systematic review found no difference between the hydroxychloroquine treated group and an untreated group of covid19 patients sarma et al 2020 who had recently postponed further clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine due to unexpected results in previous trials however this repurposed drug has been allowed for reevaluation all of this evidence points to the significance of waiting for the final results of ongoing prospective randomized controlled studies before considering these drugs as a therapeutic option for covid19 proteases have a crucial role in many signaling pathways and represent promising drug targets fora wide range of diseases including viral diseases a few protease blockers are currently under phase 1 phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials as potential drugs for treating covid19 tables 1 and 2 asc09ritonavir lopinavirritonavir asc09f  oseltamivir and ritonavir  oseltamivir are some protease inhibitor drug candidates that inhibit 3clpro and prevent subsequent progression of replication table 1 for example monotherapy or combination of lopinavir and ritonavir has been studied against merscov both in vitro and in an animal model and found to be effective chan et al 2015 de wilde et al 2014 studies showed that the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir with ribavirin and interferon alfa ifn resulted in the survival of merspatients through viral clearance kim won kee jung  jang 2016 some investigators are operating randomized openlabel trials to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of lopinavir and ritonavir for covid19 patients table 3 a recent case report claimed that a 54yearold patient administered with lopinavirritonavir showed a significant reduction of viral loads with no or little coronavirus titers lim et al 2020 a recent clinical trial chictr2000029308 however showed that lopinavirritonavir treatment caused no benefit to hospitalized patients with severe covid19 compared to standard care cao et al 2020 treatment with lopinavirritonavir was not associated with time to clinical improvement mortality at 28 days detectable viral rna and gastrointestinal adverse events compared with the standardcare group cao et al 2020 these contradictory yet promising findings highlight the importance of conducting clinical trials before using a drug as a therapeutic candidate rdrp is a vital enzyme of the viral replication machinery hence rdrp blockers could be effective antiviral therapy against sarscov2 infection depending on their mechanism of action rdrp inhibitors are of two types that is a nucleoside and nucleotide structural analogs which mimic the structure of the natural nucleoside triphosphate substrates and could interact competitively in the active site of rdrp polymerase and b nonnucleoside inhibitors are allosteric inhibitors which interact in a

alone or in combination with other drugs table 3 khalili et al 2020 inflammation is an obvious outcome of sarscov2 however no effective therapeutics targeting the inflammatory responses for sarscov2 has been approved to date fu cheng and wu 2020 reviewed the potential mechanism of fc receptor fcr blockers such as intravenous immunoglobulin antifc specific antibodies small molecules and so on which might be a therapeutic tool for reducing sarscov2 induced pulmonary inflammation moreover antiinflammatory drugs or corticosteroids might also effectively alleviate early proinflammatory response to reduce sarscov2induced inflammatory responses by blocking fcr activation besides the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin against fcr could be effective for an urgent remedy against pulmonary inflammation associated with severe lung injury as it can effectively block fcr activation these approaches may also be applied with corticosteroids or systemic antiinflammatory drugs shang zhao hu du  cao 2020 which needs further clinical trials to study the effectiveness against sarscov2 infection russell millar  baillie 2020 another potential option for reducing inflammation is siltuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody mab that binds to and halts the effect of il6 sarosiek shah  munshi 2016 chen et al 2020 recently a study in covid19 patients showed that intravenous administration of siltuximab improved clinical conditions of 33 patients stabilized or demonstrated no clinically relevant changes in 43 of patients whereas condition deteriorated in 24 patients gritti et al 2020 these results exhibit the potential role of siltuximab in treating patients with sarscov2 infection gritti et al 2020 furthermore an observational casecontrol study with 50 covid19 patients with serious respiratory complications is ongoing in italy to determine the effectivity of siltuximab nct04322188 another group of researchers di giambenedetto et al 2020 used tocilizumab a humanized antihuman interleukin6 receptor antibody of the igg1 subclass for thwarting or treating the cytokine storm in three patients of covid19 and found promising results such as reduction of fever creactive proteins and quick relief of respiratory symptoms a clinical trial is undergoing to test whether an antiil6 treatment can be effective in reducing the sarscov2induced cytokine storm and improving lung function nct04315480 some other therapeutics which have antiinflammatory and immunomodulation property are summarized in table 4 a vaccine is an ultimate hope to prevent and reduce the spread of covid19 a vaccine can be either prophylactic which prevents future infection or therapeutic which is used to treat diseases such as cancer or infectious diseases

against sarscov and merscov which were tested in animal models gao et al 2003 kim et al 2014 however there is no benign and operational vaccine available against sarscov until now development of vaccines against sarscov after the sars outbreak in 20022004 was attempted greenough et al 2005 roberts et al 2006 tripp et al 2005 however the efforts did not result in finding any effective vaccines until now during mers prevalence it was believed that sarscov would provide a foundation and a template for developing vaccines against merscov infection jiang lu  du 2013 however only one merscov dna vaccine has so far completed a phase 1 clinical trial yong ong yeap ho  tan 2019 several more viral vectoredmerscov vaccines are in progress yong et al 2019 which were reviewed by zumla chan azhar hui and yuen 2016 a suitable vaccine of sarscov2 can prevent the spread of the current pandemic covid19 and can save millions of lives and billions of money currently different research groups around the world are working with more than 100 candidate vaccines against sarscov2 based on 1 inactivated or weakened whole virus 2 nucleic acid 3 viral vector and 4 protein subunit or viruslike particles figure 3 which are in the preclinical evaluation for sarscov2 amanat  krammer 2020 chen xiong bao  shi 2020 as of may 2020 some vaccines are under different phases of clinical trials table 5 five of those vaccines are in phase 1 clinical trials six are in phase 2 trials and one vaccine candidate is in phase 3 clinical trials table 5 those candidate vaccines are dna based 2 inactivated virus 2 modified antigenpresenting cell apc 3 nonreplicating virus 2 and protein subunit based 1 table 5 the nonreplicating virusbased vaccine namely chadox1 ncov19 developed by the consortium of the jenner

elicit an immune response in the body which might prevent subsequent infection of sarscov2 lane 2020 the phase 1 trial initiated in april where 1000 plus immunizations have been accomplished and followup is currently continuing now commencing phase 2 and phase 3 trials to assess how well the vaccine provokes immune responses in older adults and to examine whether it can render protection in the wider population httpwwwoxacuknews2020-05-22-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-begin-phase-iiiii-human-trials another vaccine is the mrna1273 vaccine a synthetic strand of mrna which translates the prefusionstabilized viral spike protein the mrnas after intramuscular injection are predicted to generate antiviral responses toward the spike protein of sarscov2 furthermore the synthesis of the lipid nanoparticleencapsulated mrna vaccine does not require the viruslike conventional vaccines therefore these are harmless and ready to be tested nct04283461 however no vaccine has completed any clinical trial yet and no vaccines are available to prevent sarscov2 infection amanat  krammer 2020 chen zhang et al 2020b in the passive antibody therapy approach the antibodies from the blood plasma or serum convalescent plasma or sera of people who have recuperated from sarscov2 infection are used to enhance the immunity of newly infected patients and those at risk of the disease such as frontline caregivers or essential service providers these serum antibodies can bind to and neutralize sarscov2 casadevall  pirofski 2020 the precise timing of collecting blood from the recovered patient is crucial to boost the immunity of the patients casadevall  pirofski 2020 such approaches of using convalescent sera or plasma were used effectively in the past during mumps and measles epidemics casadevall  pirofski 2020 this approach has already been applied in china where five sarscov2 infected severely ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion from five different recovered patients chen zhang et al 2020a teixeira da silva 2020 this initiative showed promising results and improved the clinical condition of the treated patients shen et al 2020 however the limited number of participants in this study precludes a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of administering convalescent plasma it emphasizes the need for an evaluation in clinical trials with a larger sample size and proper randomized study design shen et al 2020 recently convalescent plasma therapy has started to treat 245 covid19 patients casadevall  pirofski 2020 this study will focus on the feasibility and effectiveness of plasma therapy another possible treatment option is monoclonal antibody therapy bevacizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody blocks vascular endothelial growth factor vegf to halt the angiogenesis in cancer patients ellis 2006 a phase 3 randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multicenter study of remdesivir in hospitalized adult patients with severe covid19 has been completed nct04257656 a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial is undergoing at qilu hospital of shandong university to check the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in severe or critical patients with covid19 nct04305106 covid19 patients encounter severe hypoxia which can upregulate vegf bevacizumab might reduce the vegf level and reduce the severity of the disease wang cai et al 2004 as covid19 spreads rapidly the shortest and fastest approaches such as drug repurposing could be of the right choice that needs to be employed to discover potential therapeutics currently some repurposed drugs have shown therapeutic promise and thus favipiravir for instance has already received temporary approval for use in covid19 patients other compounds with antiviral potential for example dn4hydroxycytidine showing inhibitory effects against chikungunya virus also need to be evaluated against sarscov2 however recent hype on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for example as covid19 therapy should be handled carefully as some studies claimed unprecedented sideeffects posed by these antimalarial drugs mehra et al 2020 simultaneously the path to vaccine development also needs to be minimized for longterm protection of course addressing all the possible sideeffects as viruses are prone to frequent mutation vaccines based on a single target might not work for a longer time recently in silico studies identified several protein subunits as vaccine candidates combining them into a single vaccine or multiple epitope vaccines might give better results against sarscov2 in this review we revisited the current knowledge on the potential drug targets of therapeutic promise against sarscov2 infection and highlighted the application of the drug repurposing approach the possible therapeutic options that are currently under clinical and preclinical studies have been discussed we also compiled the current clinical trials mostly based on repurposing the therapeutic agents formerly designed for other indications that have been rapidly started during the early phase of the pandemic and are currently undergoing although far from practical application significant progress has been made in vaccine development overall this current effort leaves some valuable information on prospective druggable targets and current options of possible therapeutic as well as preventive strategies providing a comprehensive and systematic guideline for those who are dedicated to covid19 research beyond the approaches that have been addressed in this review the strategies aimed at priming the host immune responses are of great potential as individuals with a compromised immune system are particularly vulnerable to covid19 moreover along with viralspecific therapeutics immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory agents acting against nonspecific inflammatory responses also need to be focused the lessons learned from this emerging pandemic can help us prepare in advance for any possible future epidemics as we live in the era of big data systematic and multidisciplinary approaches need to be employed to find drug targets and repurposing drugs for instant drug discovery the authors declare no conflict of interest  repurposing therapeutics for covid-19 rapid prediction of commercially available drugs through machine learning and docking sovesh mohapatra prathul nath manisha chatterjee neeladrisingha das deepjyoti kalita partha roy soumitra satapathi  the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months as the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines so there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by sars-cov-2 the research includes the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery in other words repurposing of existing drugs the vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time recently remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in machine learning ml technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process consequently a detailed study using ml for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required here we report the ml model based on the nave bayes algorithm which has an accuracy of around 73 to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of covid-19 our study predicts around ten fda approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing among all we suggest that the antiretroviral drug saquinavir drugbank id -db01232 would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for covid-19 treatment the ml based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications  the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease is now considered to be a pandemic threat to the global population 1-3  coronaviruses belong to a family of viruses mainly found in animals but with the recent outbreak they have transmitted to humans the new coronavirus 2019-ncov is termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov-2 4 5 6 7 8 9 which has now affected more than 200 countries with over 1218991 cases confirmed and 65878 deaths reported all over the world as on 05 april 2020 this could potentially bring major challenges to global healthcare and disastrous effect on the global economy if the virus is not contained within a few months 10  the common symptoms include cough fever shortness of breath fatigue etc which makes it confusing for the patients to differentiate the symptoms with that of the typical cold and flu 10 11 12 13  reports suggest that the virus is transmitted through body fluids of the infected patients especially when in contact and while sneezing even though exact reasons are not known unfortunately no drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies to treat sars-cov-2 infection until now efforts are ongoing on war footing to find the effective drug and vaccine to treat this pandemic coronaviruses are classified into four classes designated as alpha beta gamma and delta 14 sars-cov-2 spikes also bind to receptors on the human cell surface called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 15  like sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 also attacks the lower respiratory system causing viral pneumonia however there are also reports that it could affect the gastrointestinal system heart kidney liver and central nervous system resulting in multiple organ failure 16  compiling the medical reports and data available from the patients sarscov-2 is found to be more transmissiblecontagious than sars-cov 17  rapid development of computer aided technology like ml based on artificial intelligence ai can help accelerate the drug development process for different diseases 18 19 20  the advantage of ai approaches like ml is that they can be applied to learn from examples and build predictive models even when our understanding of the underlying biological processes is limited or when computational simulations based on fundamental physical models are too expensive to be carried away another advantage of ml is to automatically learn to identify complex patterns that categorize sets from input all rights reserved no

predict drug-target interactions as an enormous amount of complex information by studying hydrophobic interactions ionic interactions hydrogen bonding van der waals forces etc between molecules bioactivity datasets which are available from the numerous high throughput screens deliver useful means for machine learning classifiers as they contain binary information activeinactive as well as numerical values to classify different compounds under consideration 22 23  such a huge number of datasets available on biological activities of molecules derived from high throughput screens now allows to create predictive computational models in this study we have applied a machine learning approach to predict several new potential drugs for the treatment of sars-cov-2 and validated the predicted drugs initially we have trained our model with the inhibitors of the sars coronavirus 3c-like protease the fda approved drugs are only taken from the drug bank as a test model to predict the new drugs these new drugs are again validated using a docking method to ensure that the drugs match with the same active site on the protein a ranked list of drugs based on energy value is given that can be tested experimentally our study hypothesizes that the commercial fda approved antiretroviral drug saquinavir may be a potential candidate requiring to limit viral recognition of host cells or disrupt host-virus interactions thus requiring further clinical trial here we have at first taken the inhibitors of sars-cov-2 which doesnt allow them to replicate in the host these are screened and collected in the bioassay aid 1706 which were used as the main component for the modeling of the training model using ml the 914 attributes were taken under consideration for more than 200000 compounds we have not used unsupervised learning to filter out the dataset because it would have made the dataset much weaker as mentioned in the method section we have used a classifying algorithm to train the model and the best among them was further used for the testing and predicting the drugs from the drug bank the schematic of the process is shown in figure 1  we have used the nave bayes against the dataset it has shown accuracy of approximately 72999 with this model we have used the drugs from the drug bank to get predicted for the identification of the potential drugs which can be used for the treatment of disease caused by sars coronavirus along with that the model has predicted 34754 true positives and 3904 true negatives all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

the docking experiment was done with the patchdock server  httpsbioinfo3dcstauacilpatchdock the results refinement and energy calculation was performed as per the algorithm used in the firedock server

the above drug we have also docked several other approved drugs available in the drug bank which are predicted by our ml model with a confidence level of above 95 and also shows the activity of protease inhibition with reference to that we have found that the other drugs predicted by the model with the inclusion of all the parameters taken under consideration can also be quite effective the rapid identification of active therapeutic agents against sars-cov-2 is a major challenge analyzing the available knowledge on their safety profiles and in some cases efficacy against other coronaviruses and repurposing existing antiviral drugs is a potentially crucial short-term strategy to tackle covid-19 under the current scenario it takes more than 15 years to bring a drug from the investigational stages to market availability it is because of the trial and error process or the so-called edisonian approach where one keeps on analyzing several compounds to find the best possible one these days with the inclusion of digital medicine this time span has been reduced to a great extent and people are able to approach in a rational manner for the drug discovery process here we have targeted for the repurpssed drugs towards the development of effective treatment of covid-19 to speed up clinical trial we have found that ml model created on the basis of the naive bayes algorithm is the most effective one with the accuracy of almost equal to 73 the drugs predicted by this model is further verified by the docking process so we speculate can expect that our predicted the drugs show immense potential for treatment of the covid-19 considering the ongoing efforts to prevent the spread of covid-19 all over the world we are optimistic that the outbreak may subside in a few months like sars and mers however the outbreak has stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts towards the development of braod-spectrum therapeutic agents to combat coronaviruses which are repeatedly found to be a realistic threat of this century till now our this findinging will provide a base for further enhanced drug discovery programs all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was

drugs approved drugs and withdrawn drugs in this database more than 45 of drugs are approved for various medication purposes 24  in this research we have focused only on the fda approved drugs for repurposing purpose which are around 2388 with the intention that it will minimize clinical trial in the present situation these drugs were downloaded in the form of sdfs and after processing the

predicted few of the potential drugs the ncbi protein database was used in the process of getting the fasta sequence of the desired protein sars coronavirus further the fasta sequence is used for the modeling of the three-dimensional protein structure and on the basis of this structure the docking of the known and predicted drugs have been carried out 25  since the datasets are present in the form

conditions we have used machine learning ml model to the selected dataset from the pubchem which was considered as inhibitors and tested against the drugs from the drug bank to find more suitable drugs for the coronavirus-19 26  using ml we have implemented the classification algorithms as described below the classification is a type of supervised learning in which the computer system can learn from the dataset which contains the detail and practical results the algorithmic procedure of the classification is to assign an input value according to the description in the datasets 27  so for this it requires a mathematical classifier that can assign specific class active and inactive labels to instances defined by the attributes in this process the training model is made to learn using dataset where the classification is already assigned and on the basis of which it is able to run on different datasets to classify them according to the present instances in this study we have compared the results from the classifier that is nave bayes classification algorithm naive bayesian classification algorithm is a simple and elegant approach by assuming that its classification attributes are independent and they dont have any correlation with each other 28  it is a type of classifier that depends on bayes hypothesis naive bayes does work best in two cases complete independent feature as expected and functionally dependent features as expected and is a widely tested method for probabilistic induction this classifier functions well and has advantages over many other induction algorithms it has no entangled iterative parameter that makes it work for vast data sets this algorithm is more useful than any other induction algorithms because of its computation speed and reliability it can be useful for both the binary classification as well as multi-classification 29  the training model is prepared by 80 of the original dataset the dataset is completely classified from where the computer learns and finds the relations among various attributes the cross-validation is used along with the algorithm to train the model in this case the cross-validation is n set with n-folds dataset then it is supposed to divide the training dataset into n parts and the n-1 parts will be used as training data and the other one will be used to validate the rest this process of iteration goes on for n iteration times here we have used 10-fold and it is chosen as per the size of the dataset 30 31  all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was

httpsdoiorg1011012020040520054254 doi medrxiv preprint generally the datasets containing binary classification based on several attributes are imbalanced we observe the similar tred here these imbalanced datasets are not possible to be handled by the normal classifiers since they give importance to each of the attributes equally which could lead to misclassification errors this can decrease the accuracy of the dataset for the trained model 32 33  therefore we have used the misclassification cost where the trained model becomes cost sensitive and able to find the lowest expected cost this approach is actually much randomized because it neither depends upon the number of attributes nor on the minority class ration rather it depends on the base classifier 34 35  here we had two methods to introduce the misclassification cost with the imbalance dataset the first method is to classify the algorithm into the cost-sensitive one and proceed with the rest settings 36  the other is the use of a wrapper which helps in the base classifiers into cost sensitive ones we have used nave bayes classifier which uses the cost insensitive algorithm to predict the probability estimations of the test instances and then using this it predicts class labels for the examples of the test dataset in our report we have classified our datasets into two classes ie active and inactive so we used the 2x2 matrix which is generally used for the binary classification in the matrix sections are true positives active classified as active false positives inactive classified as active false negatives active classified as inactive and true negatives inactive classified as inactive in this case the percent of false negatives are more important than the percent of false positives and the upper limit for false positives were set to 20 32 36  in this process we increase the misclassification up to the set percent which also helps in the increasing of the true positives since the actives are very less in number we have replicated them to around 100-110 times to match it with the inactives and make the model less biased there are various methods for the validation of the binary classifiers the true positive rate is the ratio of the actual actives to the predicted positives and this can be obtained as tptpfn the false positive rate is the ratio of the predicted false actives to actual inactives and this can be obtained as fptnfp accuracy shows the models performance relative to the real values and this can be calculated as tntptntpfpfn the sensitivity shows the models ability to identify the positive results and this is calculated as tpfntp and the specificity shows the models ability to identify the negative results and this is calculated as tntnfp a model with high specificity and sensitivity has a low error rate the balanced classification rate bcr is the mean of the sensitivity and specificity which provides the accuracy of the model applied on the imbalanced dataset this bcr can be calculated as 05specificitysensitivity all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted

potential treatments for covid-19 nancy baker antony williams j alexander tropsha sean ekins   an exhaustive bibliometric analysis of drug repurposing over the decades conducted by this team recently has described the many drugs that have been tested for other indications 11 this analysis highlighted chloroquine as one of the most repurposed approved drugs which has been tested against hundreds of diseases 11 not surprisingly chloroquine has also been identified by several groups in china south korea and the usa 47 to have micromolar activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro and along with the derivative hydroxychloroquine has even entered multiple clinical trials supplementary material the results have not suggested good efficacy as yet 12 from the limited clinical trial reports this could be due to a number of reasons such as the metabolism and disposition of these drugs and the therapeutic window we have now used the same text mining approach to focus solely on drugs that have been used in the treatment of coronaviruses supplementary material table s1 this analysis identified ammonium chloride which is commonly used as a treatment option for severe cases of metabolicalkalosis as a drug of interest ammonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound that is known to also have antiviral activity 1314 against coronavirus supplementary material and has a mechanism of action such as raising the endocytic and lysosomal ph which it shares with chloroquine 15 review of the text-mined literature also indicated a high-frequency of quaternary ammonium disinfectants as treatments for many viruses supplementary material 1617 including coronaviruses these act by deactivating the protective lipid coating that enveloped viruses like sars-cov-2 rely on quaternary ammonium compounds are widely recommended to kill viruses and there are over 350 products on epas list n disinfectants for use against sars-cov-2 supplementary material the disinfectant concentrations and contact times associated with multiple viruses for many of the disinfecting chemicals on the epa list have been reported and  140 can deactivate the virus in just a few minutes 18 this information led us on a larger search for quaternary ammonium compounds with activity against coronaviruses and possible identification of chemicals that have already been tested in the clinic and could be used as a potential treatment for covid-19 table s2 one of the disinfectants that has been shown to be destructive to viruses supplementary material and widely used in personal care products is cetylpyridinium

and poultry products up to 1 cetylpyridinium chloride has been used in multiple clinical trials 21 including as a treatment against respiratory infections 21 validating its use as an antiviral cetylpyridinium likely promotes virus inactivation by destroying the capsid as well as through its lysosomotropic action which as discussed above is common for quaternary ammonium compounds this raises the question as to whether some of the drugs identified with antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro behave similarly namely they may destroy the virus capsid as well as accumulating in the lysosome or endosomes and ultimately blocking viral entry additional published studies have suggested that this effect can be attenuated by the use of cathepsin-l inhibitors 22 another potential treatment candidate is miramistin table 1 a drug belonging to the group of cationic antiseptics which is also a quaternary ammonium compound reported to have a wide array of biological activities including antiviral against hiv 23 miramistin is approved as broad-spectrum anti-infective agent in russia 24 but it does not appear to have been adopted in the rest of the world there are numerous fda approved drugs that have a quaternary nitrogen and it is possible these could also have a similar broad antiseptic effect the current covid-19 pandemic is sweeping the globe at an unprecedented rate fanned by our global connectivity to date it has spurred drug discovery activity albeit considerably impacted by research laboratory shutdowns and much interest in drug repurposing in the hope of delivering effective drugs to the patient faster the success of this approach will take time to validate as we await clinical trial data from all of the earliest compounds in the clinic we hypothesized that text mining of the available published literature in pubmed would enable us to identify compounds faster that have been tested against other coronaviruses but which were not currently being evaluated clinically our studies guided by this approach suggest that while many drugs have been tested the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride and quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetylpyridinium chloride and miramistin may produce the desired antiviral effect but have not as yet been tested against sars-cov-2 in vitro or in clinical trials we have briefly described this data mining process that identified these classes of compounds of interest and provide our analysis for others to expand up on supplementary material table s1 limitations of the text mining approach are that at the time of writing there had only been reports of approximately 450 molecules associated with other coronaviruses and many of these could likely be discounted due to no reported antiviral activity toxicity and perhaps most important the lack of fda approved status we propose that in particular cetylpyridinium chloride is a simple molecule that is cheap safe clinically approved widely accessible in hospitals and the consumer sector and which could enter clinical trials immediately if reported to have activity in vitro against sars-cov-2 subsequent delivery in the form of a mouthwash or nasal spray containing this compound may be an effective way both to combat the virus at its point of entry and reduce sars-cov-2 transmission similarly this compound could be added to shampoo and body cleansers so that one could effectively bathe in low concentrations of this compound to destroy shed coronavirus cetylpyridinium chloride and many other quaternary ammonium compounds have already demonstrated their antiviral activity against a wide array of related coronaviruses as disinfectants and antiseptics therefore they represent especially low hanging fruit for testing in humans due to their reported mechanisms they may also have much broader activity against viruses which could be useful to address future enveloped viruses certainly additional studies may be warranted to assess potential drug-drug or drug-transporter interactions this work may also point to other related compounds that could be utilized or at least enable the generation of new antiviral compounds that leverage the quaternary ammonium substructural fragment as a potential warhead as simple as it sounds it is entirely possible that we should be looking in our bathroom cupboards for potential remedies against covid-19  drug repurposing for viral infectious diseases how far are we beatrice mercorelli giorgio pal arianna loregian   the identification of new targets for chemotherapeutic intervention is often not paralleled by the development and licensing of new drugs antiviral agents for treating viral infectious diseases are not an exception from 2012 to 2017 only 12 new antivirals have been approved by the food and drug administration fda in the usa of which 8 are for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv-related pathologies and 2 are combinations of anti-human immunodeficiency virus hiv drugs wwwfdagov on the other hand governments and the world health organization who have to deal with critical reemerging viruses characterized by pandemic potential and responsible for alarming outbreaks in recent years which still lack specific treatment such as zika virus zikv ebola virus ebov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov a drug discovery approach that has recently become very popular is drug repurposing dr which consists of giving old drugs a new indication by exploring new molecular pathways and targets for intervention 1 2 dr applied to viral infectious diseases takes into account different strategies by integrating both screenings of bioactive small-molecule collections and computational methods in silico screenings mining of database with transcriptomic profiles etc in order to find a molecule a pathway or a biological activity that could be recycled in fighting a viral pathogen beyond the unquestionable economic advantage derived from such an approach in the drug development process repurposed drugs can quickly enter clinical trials or be employed for compassionate use especially in the case of viral diseases lacking of specific treatment moreover dr represents a constant source of new knowledge in virus biology as well as of molecules with previously undescribed antiviral properties that can be further used as molecular tools in uncovering molecular mechanisms of virus replication and pathogenesis in many cases dr points out previously unexplored cellular pathways turning them into targets for new therapeutic strategies even if the identified molecules cannot be introduced in clinical therapy in this review we describe the most meaningful results of this from bed to bench approach discuss the most promising drugs that could be repurposed to treat viral infections and analyze the possible caveats of this trendy strategy of drug discovery whose advantages and pitfalls are summarized in table 1
 three different scenarios of antiviral dr can be identified depending on whether the repurposed molecule has previously known antiviral activity figure 1
 key figure i same target  new virus the first option is when an antiviral drug that is known to target a specific viral or cellular functionpathway is found to possess activity against other viruses the antiviral activity relies on structural homology and common enzymatic features of the viral target or on shared pathways exploited for virus replication viral rna polymerase inhibitors such as favipiravir and sofosbuvir approved for the treatment of influenza virus and hcv infections respectively showed repurposing potential against ebov and zikv see below another example is represented by drugs eg chloroquine that interfere with the late-stage entry process of viruses such as filoviruses and coronaviruses which exploit cellular endocytic pathways to enter the host cell ii same target  new indication this occurs when a pharmacological target ie a protein or a pathway that can be modulated by an approved drug is found to be essential in a pathogenic process associated with a viral infection in this case the approved drug can be exploited also as an antiviral therapeutic agent new indication the case is exemplified by the anticancer drug imatinib that inhibits cellular abelson abl kinase and was found to be also active against pathogenic coronaviruses 3 iii new target  new indication this occurs when an approved drug with established bioactivity in a specific pathway or mechanism is found to have a new molecular target ie it shows polypharmacology see glossary which is essential for virus replication examples are antimicrobial agents eg teicoplanin ivermectin itraconazole and nitazoxanide that were found to have a target also in virus-infected cells whose inhibition has detrimental effects on viral replication 4 5 drugs with repurposing potential against viral diseases have been identified mostly by the screening of small-molecule libraries consisting of drugs both approved and developmental and other compounds with known bioactivity including compounds of natural origin most of these libraries are available at public institutions or commercially however a number of proprietary or in-house-made collections also exist often consisting of only one class of drugs eg kinase or apoptosis inhibitors etc and can be useful for target deconvolution table 2
lists the drug collections most widely used in antiviral dr in the past 510 years partnerships between public and private institutions have been strongly encouraged by governments to expedite the identification of new candidate drugs in particular for orphan diseases and several pharmaceutical companies have opened their proprietary collections to collaboration programs with academic research groups 6 despite the restricted number of available collections and the fact that often the same drugs are present in various libraries in several cases different outcomes for the same viral pathogen have been obtained a possible explanation is the different experimental setup used including differences in cell type virus strain dose readout method and so on conversely by screening different libraries the same drugs were independently identified in some cases eg for mers-cov see below finally virtual screening of chemical structures can also be performed to find new potential antiviral drugs however this approach is dependent upon the availability of structural information and a priori knowledge of the target it is not usually required in dr screenings aimed at the discovery of new antiviral drugs to validate a target before the screening in fact an ex-post target validation and even identification is possible once an active molecule has been identified thus dr screenings can mainly undertake two different experimental approaches i unknown target  phenotypic assay or ii known target  mechanism-based assay in the first case the target is generally unknown and a phenotypic assay is employed for the identification of hit compounds phenotypic assays are based on a readout that is synonymous with antiviral activity and can be easily monitored in a high-throughput format for example the protection of infected cell monolayers by virus-induced cytopathic effect or the detection of a late-expressed structural viral protein envelope protein in most cases are the most frequently exploited after hit identification by phenotypic assay the next step is the identification and validation of the target a protein a pathway etc which sometimes can be deduced from the mechanism of action of the identified hit compound the validation is required to demonstrate that the target is indeed essential for virus replication andor pathogenesis and is subordinated to the demonstration that its modulation leads to protection from virus infection and inhibition of virus-associated pathogenic effects experimental approaches for antiviral target validation can be exemplified by genetic knockdown through rna interference gene editing by crisprcas9 system mutational analysis and the use of pharmacological inhibitors if available all of these can be evaluated in cultured cells in organoids in ex vivo experimental models as well as in animal models finally when possible a clinical validation on patient-derived samples or data can also be performed indeed when a routinely employed drug is found to be potentially effective in the treatment of a viral infection a possible positive correlation between drug administration in target patients and inhibition of the viral infection can be retrospectively analyzed in clinical studies alternatively in mechanism-based dr screenings target validation is mandatory prior to the screening design most frequent targets are druggable viral or cellular enzymes or receptors the experimental setup in mechanism-based assays is specifically designed to identify molecules able to interfere with a particular process previously identified as essential for productive virus replication or involved in viral pathogenesis assays based on a specific mechanism that is inhibition of a transcription factor protection from apoptosis by interfering with a specific activating mechanism or inhibition of virus entry are the most popular approaches in dr screenings cell-free systems and in vitro assays with purified proteins can be used however cellular assays with engineered cell lines recombinant viruses andor replicon systems or pseudoviruses are preferred as information on target modulation is obtained directly in a physiological environment compounds identified by mechanism-based assays in dr screenings against zikv ebov and dna viruses are described below although dr screenings based on mechanism-based assays could be more convenient because the target is known sometimes false positives can be identified other limits are the possible toxicity of the hits due to off-target effects and missing antiviral compounds acting by different mechanisms because the antiviral activity is restricted to a single process established a priori in the following sections we describe the most recent advances of repurposing of existing and candidate drugs to treat infections caused by both rna and dna viruses table 3
 priority has been given to drugs that showed efficacy in clinical trials or in animal models and to investigational drugs exhibiting effective concentrations compatible with clinically achievable plasma levels in humans zikv is an arbovirus that recently caused a large outbreak in latin america generally zikv causes a self-limiting disease however zikv infection has been also associated with neurologic disorders such as guillainbarr syndrome and others and with severe congenital defects in newborns microcephaly and ophthalmological alterations when infection occurs during pregnancy as the virus is capable of human-to-human spread through both vertical transplacental and sexual transmission possible zikv pandemics are of particular concern for global public health 7 neither a specific antiviral treatment nor a vaccine to counteract zikv diffusion is available to date dr campaigns were reported shortly after the whos declaration of zikv as a public health emergency in early 2016 in some cases collections of fda-approved drugs and bioactive molecules were randomly screened while in others a specific class of compounds was considered based on previous activity against other flaviviruses or in molecular pathways relevant for pathogenesis in particular for zikv-induced neuropathogenesis in the first dr study among the identified inhibitors of zikv replication the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolic acid and the antibiotic daptomycin were the most promising because of their wide use during pregnancy to treat other diseases and their ability to cross the placenta 8 importantly for both drugs the effective anti-zikv concentration falls in a range achievable in humans thus they represent promising candidates for clinical trials successive dr screenings identified the fda-approved antihelminthic drug niclosamide and the macrolide azithromycin approved as an antibacterial agent as potent inhibitors of zikv replication in different neural cell lines targeted by zikv fetal infection 9 10 niclosamide and azithromycin are widely used drugs that can also be administered during pregnancy category b and their active concentration against zikv is clinically achievable thus although further studies are needed to evaluate their antiviral efficacy in vivo they also represent promising candidates for anti-zikv repurposing finally structure-based in silico screenings followed by in vitro and in vivo experimental studies led to the identification of another antibiotic novobiocin and other fda-approved drugs including niclosamide and temoporfin as novel inhibitors of zikv that act by targeting the ns3ns2b protease 11 12 in another study nanchangmycin a polyether of bacterial origin blocked zikv infection in different cell lines as well as in ex vivo midbrain neuronglia mixed cultures from embryonic mice 13 importantly nanchangmycin showed antiviral activity also against other viruses that share the same clathrin-dependent entry mechanism another natural compound the alkaloid hippeastrine hydrobromide hh recently emerged as a promising inhibitor of zikv replication and microcephaly-related effects 14 the anti-zikv effect of hh in human fetal-like forebrain organoids was reported as well as the rescue of organoid cells from virus-induced death importantly an 18-day treatment of zikv-infected organoids with hh resulted in size and thickness comparable to those of uninfected organoids thus suggesting a potential inhibitory effect of this compound on virus-induced microcephaly during fetal infection finally hh was also effective in a mouse model of zikv infection even when added 5 days postinfection thus highlighting its impressive therapeutic potential studies reporting the repurposing potential against zikv of drugs approved for the treatment hcv infections that is ribavirin and sofosbuvir are worth mentioning although conflicting results on the efficacy of the latter have been reported 15 16 17 18 19 20 discrepancies may be due to the different cell lines or animal models used and should be explained at a molecular level moreover deeper investigation on the safety of sofosbuvir during pregnancy is needed before considering this anti-hcv drug as a candidate for the treatment of zikv fetal infections moreover several antimalarial drugs showed anti-zikv activity 21 22 in particular chloroquine was effective in reducing zikv vertical transmission in infected pregnant mice 23 neuroprotection when coupled with drugs able to block directly virus replication during fetal infection could be able to attenuate the neurodegenerative effects of zikv in the brain and ophthalmological damage derived from virus infection of the optic nerve and ocular tissues n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists in particular memantine approved for the treatment of alzheimers disease were the most promising neuroprotective drugs in both human primary neurons and mice infected with zikv 24 many of the drugs with a repurposing potential against zikv are also active against other flaviviruses suggesting that conserved pathways could be explored for the development of broad- spectrum anti-flavivirus agents this is the case for mycophenolic acid niclosamide nanchangmycin cloroquine and other antimalarial drugs on the other hand independent dr screenings against japanese encephalitis virus jev hcv and dengue virus denv led to the identification of antiviral activity of different fda-approved drugs 25 26 27 in particular the dopamine d2 receptor antagonist prochlorperazine was identified as a potent inhibitor of hcv and denv that acts by interfering with virus attachment and entry 26 28 another drug with anti-hcv repurposing potential is the antihistamine chlorcyclizine which showed antiviral activity in both an infectious assay and a chimeric mouse model 29 to date however none of these compounds has been yet evaluated in clinical trials ebov is a filovirus responsible for several outbreaks since its discovery in the late 1970s but the last one in 20142016 was the most alarming due to its size and spread indeed it caused an international health emergency since accidentally imported ebov cases were recorded in nonendemic geographical areas such as the usa and europe ebov causes a lethal disease characterized by acute hemorrhagic fever and a very high fatality rate 90 despite this and the ease of transmission no specific therapeutics are available yet this is worsened by the high level of biocontainment bsl-4 necessary for the manipulation of this virus that considerably hampers the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines in this context dr studies were prompted by the last outbreak extensively reviewed in 30 31 32 ebov provides a unique example of a dr approach applied directly in clinical trials as during the last outbreak several drugs were evaluated in infected patients under both clinical trials and compassionate use to test their ability to protect from lethal ebov infection these included the viral rna polymerase inhibitors favipiravir approved in japan for the treatment of influenza a virus 31 33 gs-5734 an adenosine analog active against highly pathogenic coronaviruses 34 35 and amodiaquine an antimalarial drug widely used in africa treatment of ebov-infected patients with these drugs has been associated with a decrease in fatality rate compared to control patients 30 however their efficacy remains to be confirmed in randomized clinical studies preclinical dr studies were also performed with both live viruses and pseudoviruses and led to the identification of a series of approved drugs able to confer protection from lethal ebov infection in animal models however these drugs have not been tested in humans yet most of these drugs exert antiviral activity by blocking ebov at the entry step and this is biased by the fact that the use of pseudoviruses allows the identification of compounds only inhibiting viral entry promising anti-ebov activity was determined for selective estrogen receptor modulators cloremiphene and toremiphene 36 37 chloroquine and related antimalarial drugs 38 sertraline and bepridil 39 teicoplanin 40 cationic amphiphilic drugs such as amiodarone 41 and the broad-spectrum rna polymerase inhibitor bcx-4430 42 finally the frontier of dr to directly test a combination of drugs that have shown antiviral activity although at concentrations not clinically reachable in humans with the approved regimen gave successful results 43 indeed a targeted drug combination approach resulted in the identification of two sets of three-drug cocktails ie toremifenemefloquineposaconazole and toremifeneclarithromycinposaconazole all previously identified by dr that act synergistically in an ebov entry-inhibition assay and at concentrations achievable in humans 44 coronaviruses covs are rna viruses responsible for gastrointestinal respiratory and neurologic diseases in animals and for zoonotic infections in humans of particular importance is their established potential for cross-species transmission with domesticated animals which act as intermediate hosts and are responsible for infections in humans the major concerns about cov infections are their significant morbidity and mortality emergence of new viruses competent for human-to-human transmission the potential of domestic animal adaptation and the difficulty in identifying the intermediate host severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov a highly pathogenic cov emerged in china in 20022003 and was responsible for a pandemic with over 8098 infected people and 10 mortality wwwcdcgov mers-cov emerged in 2012 has spread to 27 countries so far and is characterized by a 35 mortality rate 45 thus covs represent a huge threat to public health in this scenario the search for effective therapeutic strategies is a priority for global public health management prompted by the mers-cov outbreak three independent studies reporting an approach by dr for anti-cov drug discovery were published 46 47 48 approved drugs were tested against mers- and sars-cov and two molecules were identified in two independent screenings that is the dopamine receptor antagonist chlorpromazine and the antimalarial drug chloroquine both reported to also have antiflavivirus activity these two drugs exhibited antiviral activity against both viruses and in a range clinically achievable in humans however they did not progress further in preclinical studies the dr approach also allowed identification of the abl tyrosine kinase oncogene pathway as essential for the entry of covs 3 46 indeed the abl kinase inhibitor imatinib approved as an oral anticancer agent inhibited the replication of both mers- and sars-cov by preventing the fusion of the virus with the endosomal membrane this is an important example of how dr can be determinant in the identification of host factors required for pathogen replication and in finding novel targets for antiviral intervention other host-targeting anti-cov drugs are cyclophylin a inhibitors such as cyclosporin a and alispovir 49 this latter drug had antiviral activity against both mers- and sars-cov in cell culture but failed to show a protective effect in a mouse model of sars-cov infection nonetheless cyclophylin a inhibitors deserve further investigation for their pan anti-cov activity hiv protease inhibitors were also identified by dr screenings and showed efficacy in combination with interferon -1b against mers-cov in infected cells and in a nonhuman primate model 50 currently a combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon -1b for the treatment of mers-cov syndrome is under clinical evaluation 51 influenza virus belongs to the family orthomyxoviridae and is a human pathogen of global public health importance as it causes seasonal pandemic and zoonotic influenza disease outbreaks pandemic and zoonotic influenza strains are of particular concern because of their high potential for transmission given the absence of pre-existing immunity in human populations as opposed to other rna viruses described so far in this review there are some current antiviral treatment options for influenza infections however both adamantanes inhibitors of viral ion channel m2 and neuraminidase inhibitors suffer from the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains and side effects thus limiting their therapeutic efficacy therefore new anti-influenza drugs are being developed 52 dr campaigns identified some drugs already approved or under clinical evaluation that showed anti-influenza properties such as bay 81-8781 approved as intravenous aspirin and exerting antiviral activity by blocking nf-kb pathway activation 53 dapivirine a non-nucleoside inhibitor of hiv-1 retrotranscriptase 54 naproxen which targets influenza nucleoprotein 55 and the antibiotic clarithromycin clarithromycin and naproxen  along with oseltamivir in a three-drug combination  have been evaluated in a phase 2b3 clinical trial that showed efficacy in the treatment of severe influenza 56 also nalidixic acid and dorzolamide were identified by an in silico screening specifically targeting mutant viral neuraminidase and showed efficacy against oseltamivir-resistant influenza but not against wild-type viruses 57 perhaps the most advanced example of dr is the case of the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide which is a safe drug used for the treatment of giardia and cryptosporidium spp infections currently being repurposed for the treatment of influenza 58 59 nitazoxanide is a promising anti-influenza drug candidate that interferes with the maturation of viral hemagglutinin at a post-translational level and showed efficacy in different late-stage clinical trials 60 moreover the broad-spectrum antiviral activity demonstrated by this drug able to block the replication of more than 20 different viruses raises hopes that it has other possible future indications as an antiviral dr has also been explored in the search for new antiviral strategies directed against dna viruses not considered emerging viral pathogens but responsible for latent life-long infections that can cause high morbidity and be life-threatening for at-risk populations human cytomegalovirus hcmv is a -herpesvirus that establishes persistent infection and can reactivate under conditions of immunosuppression 61 hcmv is one of the best characterized examples of host adaptation and of the ability of viruses to subvert completely cellular physiological processes in the infected cell in this context different dr campaigns identified several approved or investigational drugs with an anti-hcmv mechanism different from that of the currently available drugs 62 63 this is the case for statins 64 cardiac glycosides 65 the antiparasitic drugs emetine and nitazoxanide 62 66 kinase inhibitors 67 and the antihypertensive drug manidipine 68 all of these drugs pharmacologically modulate host proteins thus although a specific viral target cannot be excluded the anti-hcmv activity most likely relies on the interference with host pathways that are intercepted by the virus further studies are needed to identify the precise molecular mechanism a dr campaign was also performed to identify inhibitors of hepatitis b virus hbv calcium-channel blockers dopamine receptor antagonist and the antifungal terbinafine emerged as promising inhibitors of hbv rna transcription and dna synthesis 69 virus-targeting drugs also showed repurposing potential this is the case for hiv integrase inhibitors that demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against different herpesviruses by inhibiting the viral terminase 70 71 and the hiv protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir which were clinically evaluated as a potential treatment for human papilloma virus hpv-related preinvasive cervical malignancies 72 the lack of specific therapy for most viral infectious diseases remains a major medical need the development of effective therapeutics is subordinated to the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying virus replication and pathogenesis as well as virushost interactions which remain puzzling for several known viral pathogens and also represent the main challenge against future emerging viruses in this context evaluating the repurposing potential of existing or candidate drugs can represent an effective strategy for the development of ready-to-use antiviral agents as well as for the identification of new pathways and targets for intervention active drugs identified by dr could in principle skip preclinical and phase 1 safetytolerability clinical trials and directly enter phase 2 clinical trials for testing efficacy even though this strategy already demonstrated feasibility in the development of new anticancer drugs such as the antifungal drug itraconazole and its second life as an anticancer drug 73 in antiviral drug discovery there are still only a few successful examples against influenza 60 ebov 33 and mers-cov 51 see outstanding questions important issues related to dr summarized in table 1 still remain to be addressed in particular the translational aspects of this approach as well as the possible obstacles in pharmaceutical development of drugs showing repurposing potential the main obstacle to successful repurposing relies perhaps on the effective concentrations required for antiviral activity which are often higher than those clinically achievable with the approved regimens reconsidering the administration protocols in order to reach higher plasma levels is not convenient because it would mean losing one of the advantages of dr and could not be feasible due to toxicity issues the most effective solution to this issue seems to be the development of combination therapies by exploiting the synergism of two or three drugs with different mechanisms of action 43 74 promising results in this direction have been accomplished with ebov 44 and influenza 56 and could be obtained for other viruses besides the lower toxicity that can be obtained by decreasing the doses of the combined drugs combination therapy has also the advantage of reducing resistance issues there is still a caveat to act synergistically at a lower dose drugs need to not interfere with each other and to have different mechanisms of action antiviral combination therapies should be most effective when drugs inhibit as early as possible different viral functions or host pathways involved in virus replication this is the reason why the search for new antiviral targets for therapeutic interventions by different approaches still remains mandatory and can be addressed by dr campaignsoutstanding questionswill combination therapy overcome the issue of low potency of drugs identified by drug repurposingwill the gap left by the lack of effective animal models that recapitulate human viral diseases and virus-associated pathogenesis be filledwill a dr approach in antiviral drug discovery translate into the evaluation of repurposed drugs directly to phase ii clinical trials similar to what occurs for other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorderswill dr benefit from productive publicprivate partnerships aimed at overcoming intellectual property program restriction and business issuesare we prepared for the clinical evaluation of potentially repurposed drugs during a future outbreak of highly pathogenicpandemic viruses such as ebov zikv or other respiratory virusescould all the information and experience acquired in dr campaigns be useful and determinant for the containment of newly emerging viruses in the future
  china through a drug-target interaction deep learning model bo beck ram bonggun shin yoonjung choi sungsoo park keunsoo kang  the infection of a novel coronavirus found in wuhan of china 2019-ncov is rapidly spreading and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-ncov various strategies are being tested in china including drug repurposing in this study we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called molecule transformer-drug target interaction mt-dti to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-ncov the result showed that atazanavir an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus hiv is the best chemical compound showing a inhibitory potency with kd of 9494 nm against the 2019-ncov 3c-like proteinase followed by efavirenz 19917 nm ritonavir 20405 nm and dolutegravir 33691 nm interestingly lopinavir ritonavir and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases however in our prediction they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-ncov with an inhibitory potency with kd  1000 nm in addition we also found that several antiviral agents such as kaletra could be used for the treatment of 2019-ncov although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction overall we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the mt-dti model should be considered when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-ncov  coronaviruses covs belonging to the family coronaviridae are positive-sense enveloped rna viruses and cause infections in birds mammals and humans 1 2 3  the family includes four genera such as alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus deltacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus 4  two infamous infectious coronaviruses in the genus betacoronavirus are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 5 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 6  which have infected more than 10000 people around the world in the past two decades unfortunately the incidence was accompanied by high mortality rates 96 for sars-cov and 344 for mers-cov indicating that there is an urgent need for effective treatment at the beginning of the outbreak to prevent the spread 7 8  however this cannot be achieved with current drug development or an application system taking several years for newly developed drugs to come to the market unexpectedly the world is facing the same situation as the previous outbreak due to a recent epidemic of atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in wuhan china 5 9  thus a rapid drug application strategy that can be immediately applied to the patient is necessary currently the only way to address this matter is to repurpose commercially available drugs for the pathogen in so-called drug-repurposing however in theory artificial intelligence ai-based architectures must be taken into account in order to accurately predict drug-target interactions dtis this is because of the enormous amount of complex information eg hydrophobic interactions ionic interactions hydrogen bonding andor van der waals forces between molecules to this end we previously developed a deep learning-based drug-target interaction prediction model called molecule transformer-drug target interaction mt-dti 10  in this study we applied our pre-trained mt-dti model to identify commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially disrupt 2019-ncovs viral components such as proteinase rna-dependent rna polymerase andor helicase since the model utilizes simplified molecular-input line-entry system smiles strings and amino acid aa sequences which are 1d string inputs it is possible to quickly apply target proteins that do not have experimentally confirmed 3d crystal structures such as viral proteins of 2019-ncov we share a list of top commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially hinder the multiplication cycle of 2019-ncov with the hope that effective drugs can be developed based on these ai-proposed drug candidates and act against 2019-ncov amino acid sequences of 3c-like proteinase accession yp0097253011 rna-dependent rna polymerase accession yp0097253071 helicase accession yp0097253081 3-to-5 exonuclease accession yp0097253091 endornase accession yp0097253101 and 2-o-ribose methyltransferase accession yp0097253111 of the 2019-ncov replication complex were extracted from the 2019-ncov whole genome sequence accession nc0455122 from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database the raw prediction results were screened for antiviral drugs that are fda approved target viral proteins and have a kd value less than 1000 nm molecule transformer-drug target interaction mt-dti was used to predict binding affinity values between commercially available antiviral drugs and target proteins briefly the natural language processing nlp based bidirectional encoder representations from transformers bert framework is a core algorithm of the model with good performance and robust results in diverse drug-target interaction datasets through pretraining with chemical language smiles of approximately 1000000000 compounds to train the model the drug target common dtc database 11 and bindingdb 12 database were manually curated and combined three types of efficacy value ki kd and ic50 were integrated by a consistence-score-based averaging algorithm 13 to make the pearson correlation score over 09 in terms of ki kd and ic50 since the bindingdb database includes a wide variety of species and target proteins the mt-dti model has the potential power to predict interactions between antiviral drugs and 2019-ncov proteins the 2019-ncov 3c-like proteinase was predicted to bind with atazanavir kd 9494 nm followed by efavirenz ritonavir and other antiviral drugs that have a predicted affinity of kd  100 nm potency table   1  no other protease inhibitor antiviral drug was found in the kd  1000 nm range although there is no real-world evidence about whether these drugs will act as predicted against 2019-ncov yet some case studies have been identified for example a docking study of lopinavir along with other hiv proteinase inhibitors of the cov proteinase pdbid 1uk3 suggests atazanavir and ritonavir which are listed in the present prediction results may inhibit the cov proteinase in line with the inhibitory potency of lopinavir 14  according to the prediction viral proteinase-targeting drugs were predicted to act more favorably on the viral replication process than viral proteinase through the dti model table 2 -6  the results include antiviral drugs other than proteinase inhibitors such as guanosine analogues eg acyclovir ganciclovir and penciclovir reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors among the prediction results atazanavir was predicted to have a potential binding affinity to bind to

has become the current health distress to the entire world in the pandemic scenario the research on the rapid development of new drug molecules is highly risky and tedious process the current covid-19 emergency demands an urgent development of possible strategies to protect people at high risk of infection and hence the drug repurposing became an emerging approach to fight covid-19 this review summarizes an update on various therapeutic strategies with special attention on repurposing of drugs to fight against sars-cov-2 worldwide the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes is one line of scientific research followed to develop safe and effective covid-19 treatments broad-spectrum antiviral agents bsaas that have been believed to be safe through testing on early phase clinical trials have been hyped as good drug repurposing candidates broad-spectrum antiviral drugs such as ribavirin umifenovir were advised for covid-19 treatment some antibiotics may be repurposed as covid-19 treatments such as teicoplanin oritavancin dalbavancin monensin and azithromycin ivermectin an antiparasitic is recently repurposed hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine having immunomodulating effect on humans have been shown to have antiviral activity at starting and post-entry stages of the sars-cov-2 infection there is a need for global health emergency to call for a courageous global response at the political and governmental levels therefore the regulatory agencies must act swiftly to lessen any financial obstacles involving private companies and update guidelines for drug licenses by repurposing if necessary katakam prakash  adiki shanta k  assaleh fathi h  ahmed mohammed m subject areas pharmacodynamics sinead oaposdonovan m hunter eby nicholas

mccullumsmithutoledo  the covid-19 pandemic caused by the novel sars-cov-2 is more contagious than other coronaviruses and has higher rates of mortality than influenza as no vaccine or drugs are currently approved to specifically treat covid-19 identification of effective therapeutics is crucial to treat the afflicted and limit disease spread we deployed a bioinformatics workflow to identify candidate drugs for the treatment of covid-19 using an omics repository the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs we simultaneously probed transcriptomic signatures of putative covid-19 drugs and signatures of coronavirus-infected cell lines to identify therapeutics with concordant signatures and discordant signatures respectively our findings include three fda approved drugs that have established antiviral activity including protein kinase inhibitors providing a promising new category of candidates for covid-19 interventions  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is responsible for the first global pandemic in a decade coronavirus disease 2019 covid-191 initial reports of a novel sars-like acute respiratory syndrome emerged in late 2019 from wuhan china2 since then covid-19 has spread to over 150 countries and all continents except antarctica34 at the time of writing over one million people have been infected over 60000 deaths have been attributed to this outbreak4 and millions of additional infections are projected to occur globally in upcoming months34 covid-19 is less infectious than sars-cov1 but more lethal than the common flu1 with an estimated mortality rate of 342 the incubation period on average is 52 days in severe cases the median time course from disease onset to death is 14 days5 while fever cough fatigue and myalgias6-10 are common mild presentations of covid-19 the disease can fatally evolve into a severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome hypoxemic respiratory failure and cytokine storm secondary to prolonged infection8 in addition to the significant medical burden imposed by this outbreak it is estimated that the global economic cost of covid-19 will be over 1 trillion in 202011 the emotional toll on individuals will be incalculable with prolonged quarantine policies restricting personal freedom and social contacts current treatment is supportive and is focused on managing disease complications and secondary symptoms12-14 drugs indicated for other infectious diseases such as antiviral and antiparasitic therapies have been used for covid-19 patients but there is a paucity of evidence supporting their efficacy15 there is now an immediate need to identify therapeutic compounds that can be rapidly repurposed for covid-19 treatment recent efforts to address this pressing public health concern include a comprehensive network-based approach to identify 16 candidate drugs and drug combinations that may be repurposed for the treatment of this disease16 to further expand this area of novel research in the present study we employ a bioinformatics approach with the goal of datamining an extensive drug signature resource to distill a list of drug therapies that may prove fruitful in the search for covid-19 therapies to accomplish this we apply a signature-based connectivity analysis17-19 utilizing the extensive chemical perturbagen omics datasets deposited in the library of integrated network-based signatures lincs database172021 lincs is a repository for systematically generated gene signatures based on the l1000 assay22 these gene signatures reflect cellular perturbations in response to pharmacological treatments lincs contains datasets for over 40000 small molecules drugs in various cell lines different small molecules that produce signatures composed of highly similar patterns of gene expression changes or concordant signatures reflect shared connections between small molecules here we apply a two-pronged approach to identify novel compounds for the treatment of covid-19 first we identify pharmacologic therapies that are effective in the treatment of pathogens in the coronavirus family like sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers as well as other viral illnesses23-27 we then generate gene signatures for these targets in ilincs httpilincscom and highlight connected small molecule signatures to identify which of these candidate drugs are highly concordant with current therapies simultaneously we generate gene signatures from coronavirus infected human cell line transcriptomic datasets we analyze these data in ilincs to directly match disease signatures with discordant small molecule signatures thereby identifying drugs that reverse the disease signature finally we compile a list of drugs from these two approaches to identify high-yield candidate drugs that may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of covid-19 applying the workflow outlined in figure 1  we identified nine drugs with known efficacy in treating coronavirus family pathogens for which there are gene signatures in ilincs table 1 and extended   information in table s1  these drugs were clustered into five groupings according to their mechanism of action anatomical therapeutic chemical atc classification andor structural similarity table 1  simultaneously we extracted differential gene expression data on the 978 genes that comprise the l1000 from a publically available sars gse56192 transcriptomic dataset gene signatures composed of genes changed lfc  05 and  -05 were generated for the disease signature table   s2  in ilincs we conducted connectivity analysis to identify chemical perturbagens that are highly concordant to the drug target groupings  0321 or highly discordant to the disease signatures  -0321 established minimum ilincs concordance score cutoffs 2228 this resulted in identification of 112 chemical perturbagens common to two cell lines mcf7 and ha1e  figure 2  fourteen chemical perturbagens were identified at concordance scores  08 in both cell lines and were considered candidate drugs for the treatment of covid-19  table 2  the tanimoto scores for the candidate drugs and the original 9 drug targets were generated showing structural similarity between drugs currently in use for the treatment of coronavirus family pathogens and our newly identified candidate drugs  figure s1  unsupervised clustering of l1000 disease gene signatures demonstrates significant differences in patterns of gene expression induced by sars mers and influenza  figure s2  influenza is utilized as a control dataset as it represents a non-coronavirus pathogen that also causes respiratory illness as promising genistein has yet to be explored as an antiviral therapy in humans at9283 is a broad protein kinase inhibitor5556 canonically it acts as a receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor but also effectively inhibits serinethreonine kinases aurora ab kinases janus kinases jak 23 and abl kinases57 in a clinical setting at9283 has been predominantly studied as an antineoplastic for hematologic malignances and several trials are underway58-60 at9283 has not been explored directly as an antiviral although the abl kinase inhibitor imatinib is efficacious in preventing coronavirus sars-cov and mers-cov viral fusion with endosomes effectively halting viral activity61 given its role as a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor researching the antiviral properties of at9283 may prove fruitful serine threonine kinase inhibitors alvocidib also known as flavopiridol is a pan-specific cyclindependent kinases cdk inhibitor that inhibits cdk1 cdk2 cdk4 cdk5 cdk6 cdk7 and cdk962 alvocidib is under clinical investigation as an antineoplastic for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies63 like other cdk kinase inhibitors alvocidib has been implicated as a broad antiviral against several dna virus families64 alvocidib has been studied as an inhibitor of transcriptional activation and elongation in the infectious lifecycle of dna viruses hsv-1 hsv-2 and retroviruses hiv29-32 and also suppresses replication of influenza a33 this suggests that alvocidib is a strong candidate drug for repurposing the antiviral activity of the following serinethreonine kinase candidate drugs have yet to be studied directly and further research is required to determine their potential as repurposable antiviral therapies however these candidates are members of drug families with demonstrated antiviral or antimicrobial properties that could be exploited for the treatment of covid-19 gsk-1059615 is a reversible atp-competitive thiazolidinedione inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase pi3k and has been studied as an antineoplastic for solid tumors65 though the antiviral activity of gsk-1059615 has yet to be determined the thiazolidinedione drug family has a broad range of antibacterial and antiparasitic activity66-68 idelalisib is a phosphoinositol 3-kinase  idebenone is a synthetic derivative of ubiquinone also known as coenzyme q108283 this drug acts to increase the production of atp by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation as a general antioxidant idebenone may prevent lipid peroxidation reduce membrane oxidative stress and scavenge free radicals84 idebenone has been used for a number of human neurodegenerative disorders and its safety has been validated8586 antioxidants such as idebenone have been hypothesized to mitigate the deleterious effects of a reactive-oxygen species burst45 from viruses with a pulmonary and respiratory predilections influenza and sars44 however further work is required to determine the utility of antioxidants like idebenone as adjunct treatments for covid-19 penicillin v is a beta-lactam antibiotic and is indicated primarily for treating gram-  the covid-19 outbreak is an escalating public health concern that requires a swift and baricitinib may reduce the ability of the virus to enter cells and is currently in clinical use as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis to advance therapeutic discovery and the identification of candidate drugs for covid-19 we employ an alternative signature-based bioinformatic approach in this study we data mine the extensive lincs database which acts as a repository of l1000 gene signatures generated by treating various cell lines with over 20000 small molecules the l1000 genes are a reduced representation of the transcriptome a method by which a select group of genes account for 82 of the information content of the transcriptome95 the approach involved feature selectionreduction techniques applied to 12063 gene expression samples profiled on microarrays from geo96 benchmarking of the l1000 assay versus rnaseq yielded a cross-platform correlation of 08495 suggesting the l1000 assay represents an efficient alternative to rna-seq utilizing this resource our two-pronged connectivity analysis approach identified candidate drugs that are 1 highly concordant to current drugs employed to treat coronavirus family pathogens and 2 highly discordant to sars disease gene signatures interestingly the antibiotic quinacrine was also identified in a recent network-based covid-19 drug screen16 and another -lactam antibody ceftriaxone is in clinical trial for adjunct treatment of covid-19 nct02735707 the immunosuppressant sirolimus was identified in our study albeit at a less stringent threshold as well as in another in silico drug screen16 as a candidate repurposable drug for treating covid19 immunosuppressants may address the symptoms resulting from overactivation of the immune system cytokine storm in response to covid-19 infection114 and this class of drug is also in clinical trial as adjunct treatments eg thalidomide nct04273529 the antimicrobial drugs that comprise our drug target groupings are limited to those that have gene signatures in ilincs we analyze gene signatures generated in two cell lines mcf7 and ha1e as data was available for all of our drug targets in these cell lines only  the workflow for this study is outlined in figure 1  we conducted a pubmed search using search terms coronavirus or covid-19 and antiviral or drug or therapy and generated a list of compounds utilized to treat coronavirus family pathogens or identified as putative covid-19 therapeutics we identified seventeen drugs for potential analysis table s1  l1000 gene signature datasets were available for nine of the seventeen drugs table 1 next we grouped the nine drug targets based on canonical mechanism of action the anatomical therapeutic chemical atc classification and structural similarity drugs were grouped together if they were categorized by at least two of the three methods the database drugbank httpswwwdrugbankca was used to group the drugs by their canonical mechanisms of actions drug identification was only referenced from drug bank id if no drug bank id was available this is indicated in table 1 and table s1  if there was no listed moa from drug bank then the moa was appropriately cited referenced from ilincs or was referenced from gene ontology go molecular function 2018 accessed via enrichr httpamppharmmssmeduenrichrenrich next drugs were classified based on the atc classification system httpswwwwhoccnoatcdddindex if a particular drug did not have an atc classification it was marked as unclassified from drugbank we also collected the clinical indications gene targets and trade names in addition we probed the atc index httpswwwwhoccnoatcdddindex to identify the first-and second-level of drug classifications the first-level classification was used to confirm drug grouping finally to group drugs based on structural similarity the structural data files sdf for the nine drugs under investigation were downloaded from drugbank the package chemminer was used to generate 1024-bit binary fingerprints for each compound the tanimoto coefficient between all pairs of fingerprints were then computed also using the r package chemminer the tanimoto coefficient also known as the jaccard similarity represents the most popular measure for chemical similarity115 and is the ratio of the intersection of the two fingerprints divided by the union of the two fingerprints the data were visualized using the corrplot package with a final list of drug clusters the individual drug signatures within each grouping were collected and averaged across the l1000 using the ilincs portal we acquired the lincs chemical perturbagen signatures 978 genes that comprise the l1000 for each drug candidate genes with a log fold change lfc value of  085 or  -085 indicating differential gene expression induced by the drug target compared to a corresponding control cell line were exported to microsoft excel gene lists were pooled and averaged such that a master list of differentially expressed genes was generated for each drug candidate family for example genes with a lfc  085 or  -085 that appeared in both the hydroxychloroquine gene signature and the chloroquine gene signature were averaged to calculate mean values for each differentially expressed gene in drug target grouping 1 next the upregulated genes lfc  085 were clustered and the downregulated genes  -085 were clustered these clusters were uploaded as user generated signatures into ilincs next we identified connected chemical perturbagens utilizing a concordance threshold score of  0321 an established minimum concordance score cutoff 2228 to identify chemical perturbagen signatures that are considered highly correlated with our drug target grouping signatures selected for these datasets is 24h we conducted differential gene expression analysis of these datasets comparing virus infected samples to corresponding control samples rnaseq raw count data were analyzed using edger r package v3281 for differential gene expression118 as a quality control step we require that a gene have a count of at least 10 in at least some libraries before it is considered to be expressed normalization was performed using the default method trimmed mean of m-values tmm this step is performed by using the calcnormfactor function which returns the dgelist argument with a set of calculated normalization factors one for each sample to eliminate composition biases between libraries orghsegdb r package v3100 was used to complement the gene annotation following analysis of the disease transcriptomic datasets the subset of genes that comprise the lincs l1000 were extracted from the differentially expressed gene list for each dataset when the l1000 genes were extracted from the sars and mers rnaseq datasets 944 and 947 overlapping genes respectively were extracted we used the existing gene raw counts from geo and did not remap the genes thus if some of the l1000 genes were not mapped we were unable to access their expression in addition we applied a gene raw count cutoff of 10 as a quality control step which also reduced the number of l1000 genes found in the final differential expression gene lists the extracted l1000 genes were uploaded into ilincs genes with lfc in expression within three thresholds 026 lfc 05 lfc and all l1000 genes were identified with a custom r script for further processing as described above upregulated and down regulated disease gene signatures were generated for each disease dataset within each threshold and uploaded into ilincs to identify connected perturbagens for disease gene signatures chemical perturbagen signatures that are highly discordant discordance score  -0321 indicating these perturbagens may reverse the disease signature were identified genes at lfc  05 and  -05 threshold were then carried forward for further analysis utilizing this gene threshold generated optimal sars disease signatures to identify a large number of discordant chemical perturbagens in addition we identified a microarray dataset of human airway epithelium cells infected with influenza a of the h1n1 serotype gse47963 36h time point the microarray data were extracted using geoquery r package v2541 119 specifically soft format files from geo containing all of the information in the geo records were parsed the normalized gene expression values associated with soft files for selected samples filewere then analyzed using limma r package v3422 linear model for microarray120 as described above the l1000 genes were extracted since this dataset was performed on the microarray platform which limits the gene detection to the probes available in the arrays we extracted 968 l1000 genes in addition to the mers dataset which represents a pathogenic coronavirus like sars the influenza dataset was used as a comparison dataset in unsupervised clustering and biological pathway analyses described below influenza a represents a non-corona family virus that also causes respiratory disease121 a total of 906 overlapping l1000 genes were used in clustering analysis and heat map generation candidate drugs were identified from the chemical perturbagen connectivity analysis using a custom script in r the script downloaded the data from the ilincs api and used the following criteria chemical perturbagens had a concordance score  0321 compared to drug target grouping signatures or a discordance score  -0321 compared to disease signatures in cell lines mcf7 in total 112 chemical perturbagens were common to both cell lines chemical perturbagens with concordance scores  08 in the mcf7 and ha1e cell lines are considered candidate drugs resulting in a final list of 14 candidate drugs heat maps of the l1000 gene data for each of the drug target groupings candidate drugs and disease sars and mers datasets were generated as described above in addition the l1000 gene data for furosemide fur a drug which is not used to treat viral pathogens or related illnesses and influenza a non-coronavirus family pathogen associated with respiratory illness were included in the heat maps these datasets acts as controls suggesting that the drug target groupings and candidate drugs but not unrelated drugs are discordant with coronavirus disease signatures specifically the sdf for the 9 drugs that comprise the drug target groupings were downloaded from drugbank the sdf files for the 14 candidate drugs were downloaded from pubchem and chembl chemminer was used to convert the sdf files to binary chemical fingerprints the tanimoto coefficients of the chemical fingerprints between the 9 drugs that comprise the drug target groupings and the 14 candidate drugs for all pairs were computed using the chemminer library the tanimoto coefficient also known as the jaccard similarity represents the established measure for chemical similarity the data were then visualized as a heat map using the gplots package r scripts utilized in data processing can be accessed at httpsgithubcomalisajidcovid19 unsupervised clustering analysis was performed on log fold change values of disease and drug target signatures and heat map was generated using pheatmap package122 in r programming language to generate biological pathways

for covid-19 research from a large volume of scientific literature sabber ahamed asurion nashville manar samad d  the year 2020 has seen an unprecedented covid-19 pandemic due to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus in 180 countries in a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for covid-19 many scientists are working around the clock their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information in this paper we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics transmission drug types and genome research related to coronavirus a subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information within each subgraph we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs diseases pathogens hosts of pathogens and biomolecules the results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs chloroquine amantadine dexamethasone pathogen-hosts pigs bats macaque cynomolgus viral pathogens zika dengue malaria and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms oligonucleotide interferon glycoprotein in connection with the core topic of coronavirus the categorical summary of these keywords and topics may be a useful reference to expedite and recommend new and alternative directions for covid-19 research  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emerged in 2002 following the outbreak of a new sars-related coronavirus scv which has resulted in hundreds of deaths world-wide after infecting thousands of individuals fouchier et al 2003  since then there has been a plethora of research aiming at understanding the etiology of the disease weiss and navas-martin 2005  developing more reliable and faster diagnostic solutions yamaoka et al 2016  and innovating antiviral drugs keyaerts et al 2009 and vaccines yong et al 2019  many of these studies have successfully repurposed previous findings to solve new challenges in biology and medicine for example if a group of viruses shares a common protein structure then therapies for one viral infection can be repurposed for new diseases like covid-19 unfortunately viruses often mutate to several challenging strains that are capable of infecting humans in a highly contagious manner this eventually triggers the onset of zoonotic infections ie animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission of the virus strain ozawa and kawaoka 2013  the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease has emerged due to a new strain of scv named as the sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that is arguably hosted by bats  as of march 31st 2020 857487 people of 180 countries have been infected by the virus in about three months taking a toll of 42107 human lives as the numbers continue to grow exponentially dong et al 2020  this outbreak has already started to cause an unprecedented impact on humankind at a scale that threatens to reshape the global economy human lives and the world beyond unfortunately it entails substantial time and effort to study these new strains of viruses arxiv200402085v1 csir 5 apr 2020 before developing a targeted and fail-safe drug or vaccine without any immediate solution several countries have recently approved the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat critically ill patients diagnosed with covid-19 despite its known side-effects  masuelli et al 2017  notably hydroxychloroquine is a drug for treating patients diagnosed with malaria ben-zvi et al 2012  this repurposing of malaria drug to treat coronavirus related patients suggests that topics of virology genetic engineering bio-informatics pharmacology in the literature may have valuable recommendations for covid-19 research since the 2002 outbreak of coronavirus many scholarly articles have been published on the topics of sars and scv it is not feasible for scientists to survey such a massive volume of diverse literature to derive useful cross-disciplinary insights within a short period of time computer-based modeling of text documents can be a powerful approach in search of valuable information from a large collection of diverse literature in this paper we have developed a graph-based model using a large volume of scientific literature to discover latent keywords that may recommend new information to combat the battle against covid-19 in text analytics keywords searching plays an important role in document summarization hernndez-castaeda et al 2020  classification diaz-manriquez et al 2018  and topic modeling jelodar et al 2019  however the task of preserving semantic and syntactic information of a language in numerical models is not trivial there are three broad categories of text-to-numeric representation models first term-frequency-inverse-document frequency tf-idf yuntao et al 2005  is one of the earliest methods for text representation based on word count however such models do not capture semantic relevance and syntactic ordering of the words second manifold learning techniques such as skip gram cheng et al 2006 and glove pennington et al 2014  have been developed to efficiently capture semantic relevance between words in numeric data vectors these numeric embeddings do not directly map the intricate relationship between words within a document third graphs can be used to develop an interconnected network of words of a document to directly model the syntactic ordering and connectivity between words a graph-based keyword extraction model using collective node weight kecnw has been proposed based on node-edge rank centrality measure biswas et al 2018  several attributes such as the distance from the central node the selectivity of each node based on a number of its connecting edges and the importance of neighboring nodes are taken into account to determine the weight of each node the node weights are used to rank individual words for keyword selection additionally graph-based models provide informative and interactive visualization of complex interconnected network of words in a document rusu et al 2009  the goal of this paper is to develop a dense graphical network of words to summarize thousands of research articles into topics related to coronavirus the collection of influential nodes or keywords may provoke new research topics for the ongoing covid-19 research the steps involved in the proposed research methodology are discussed below in this work we use the publicly available covid-19 open research dataset cord-19 released by a collaborative initiative of the allen institute for ai chan zuckerberg initiative czi georgetown universitys center for security and emerging technology cset microsoft and the national library of medicine nlm at the national institutes of health nih at the request of the white house office of science and technology policy the dataset includes about 13000 scholarly articles with full texts in the areas of life science including pharmacology immunology physiology microbiology clinical medicine genetics veterinary and many more the articles are related to the study of covid-19 sars-cov-2 and similar other coronaviruses the dataset comes with metadata and actual article texts in structured data fields that identify title paper and publication information abstract and the main body texts more details of the dataset can be found on the kaggle website httpswwwkagglecomallen-institute-for-ai cord-19-research-challenge which is a community-based data science platform for solving problems around the world we propose a directed graph gn e based model that is represented by a set of nodes n and a set of edges e with directions each node n  n represents a unique word a directed edge e  e connects two adjacent words based on their positioning in a sentence the direction of an edge points from the preceding word to the succeeding word in a sentence as shown in figure 1  using this principle a sequence-based text graph is first generated using texts of the articles in the next step we determine the importance of each node in the graph based on the concept of centrality in general a node with a higher centrality has more central positioning in the graph for example the node with relatively shortest paths to all other nodes in the graph has the highest measure of centrality hage and harary 1995  in this paper we measure the centrality of a node using the betweenness centrality bc algorithm that is widely applied in social network analysis however the bc algorithm has not been well studied in topic selection and modeling with a large volume of texts as we propose in this article the bc algorithm is originally proposed by freeman 1977 and later upgraded by brandes 2001 to improve its computational performance in bc measurement the node with highest centrality will be located in the highest number of shortest paths between all other node pairs in the graph in other words if a word frequently appears between the shortest paths of other word pairs then the word will have a high value of centrality thus the bc algorithm finds influential words that are imperative for understanding the relationship between word pairs such transitive words are weighted as representative nodes in the graph and selected as key topics for subsequent analysis intuitively this approach is more sophisticated and informative than using a distance-based centrality measurement if u v w n such that u  v  w the shortest path between any two nodes can be calculated using a standard dijkstras algorithm to measure bc of a node w in the graph the number of shortest paths between all other node pairs is first obtained and denoted by  uv  next the number of shortest paths  uv w is counted between all other node pairs that include the target node w on the path the ratio of these two counting numbers is calculated for each pair of nodes as the pair-dependency  uv  below the sum of pair-dependency across all possible pairs excluding w in the graph yields the bc of the target node w as below each node representing a unique word can be a representative topic by itself the corpus words are ranked by bc measurements to select semantically important key topics with relatively high bc values the key topics are then used to create their corresponding subgraphs each topic word is the center of the subgraph and its neighboring words are the constituents of the topic the proposed method does not require the number of topics in advance compared to other topic modeling algorithms such as latent dirichlet allocation lda hoffman et al 2010 and latent semantic analysis lsa landauer et al 1998  we develop the proposed model and perform the text analysis on a python programming environment using several python packages these packages include natural language tool kit nltk for basic text analysis and regular expressions package re for text preprocessing a graph database neo4j and a python to database connector library py2neo are used to build the graph the first step in text processing is to identify and remove stop words words with little or no merit as keywords from the corpus this step not only reduces the complexity in the graph modeling but also puts more weights on relevant candidate words in the graph the dataset includes research articles composed in chinese russian arabic and korean languages we confine our analysis to english articles by excluding all non-english words using regular expression regex regex is also used to filter out undesired symbols and numeric data the graph data including nodes and edges are exported to gephi bastian et al 2009 for better visualization and manipulation of the graph models and model-driven results all the notebooks with source code and data are publicly shared in a github project repository httpsgithubcommsahamedcovid19-text-network the proposed graph model is developed using all available article abstracts in the dataset we assume that an abstract has succinct and sufficient information to represent the overall content of a research article once the global graph is developed using the article abstracts we find several influential words based on their bc values that are linked to coronavirus next we build separate subgraph for each of the selected key topic as shown in figure 1  within each subgraph neighboring nodes of a key topic are expected to reveal a variety of information about the topic word the neighboring words are further grouped into several categories within each category we rank order the neighboring words using bc values obtained from the subgraph model to identify their relative importance we discuss our findings of this approach in the next section the cord-19 dataset has a substantial number of articles with missing abstracts therefore we use available abstracts for 10683 research articles to build our proposed graph model in the data processing step we have created a list of 2796 stop words based on the word frequency and visual scrutiny to exclude them from the corpus we first find the word coronavirus in the global graph to select its three neighboring nodes with high bc values since bc values can be exponentially very large we take natural logarithm of these values log bc we select three key topics transmission drug and gene with log bc values of 1665 1675 and 1827 respectively in the following subsections we discuss our findings on the three subgraph models corresponding to transmission drug and gene topics respectively studies related to infectious disease transmission are important in understanding the spread and growth of pathogens in different media table 1 shows the neighboring words of the transmission subgraph the subgraph reveals a number of host-pathogen interactions animal hosts such as poultry camel dogs pigs monkeys chimpanzees may be candidates for studying the transmission mechanism of different zoonotic pathogens related coronavirus the coronavirus related topic transmission also connects to a number of diseases and pathogens including rabies dengue tuberculosis adenovirus malaria measles and hand-foot-and-mouth disease hfmd these pathogens may have interesting traits in common with the transmission of coronavirus keywords such as multi-drug resistant organism mdro tropism the growth or movement of organisms zoonosis the topic of disease transmission from animals to humans sanitization bioaerosols have expectedly appeared in the subgraph of transmission topic additionally the subgraph includes words related to different transmission media such as blood respiratory lung water aerosol oronasal gut mouth trachea glands droplet saliva airborne and semen other miscellaneous keywords are presented in table 1 that includes infants and pregnancy that are important topics for transmission studies figure 2 shows the most important keywords in the transmission subgraph based on their bc measurements among the pathogen hosts pigs dogs and camels have topped the list although bats do not appear in this list of hosts they do appear later in the gene subgraph the top diseases in the rank ordering such as dengue rabies malaria adenovirus may have some topics common with the study of coronavirus transmission the rhinovirus related to common cold and lyssavirus often hosted by bats have appeared in the ranking the adenovirus ranked in the third position causes symptoms similar to those of coronavirus infection the study of drugs pharmacology plays a big role in the battle against diseases we group the neighboring words within the drug subgraph into four categories drug chemical compound disease and miscellaneous figure 3 shows the most important keywords under four different categories interestingly antiviral drug amantadine has the highest rank even before chloroquine amantadine is administered to treat symptoms related to flu viruses although it may not be effective for treating illness due to all types of virus strains dexamethasone has almost similar bc measurement as chloroquine which is a drug to aid the immune system in the fight against inflammation in the disease category of the drug subgraph zikavirus and pneumonia appear as the top two keywords followed by hiv and dengue this rank ordering is quite different from that of the transmission subgraph figure 2 where dengue topped the list there may be common pharmaceutical interests shared by the drugs used for zikavirus and coronavirus treatment in the chemical category glycoprotein and a chemical reaction known as glycosylation have topped the list oligonucleotides single strands of rna have ranked fourth in this category presumably because of their known effect in inhibiting the replication of influenza virus kumar et al 2013  interestingly plant-based compound glycyrrhizin ranks fifth in the list which has been used to cure bronchitis gastritis and jaundice there are other proteins and enzymes in the list that will require further discussion by the field experts the miscellaneous category suggests research studies focusing on metabolism prophylaxis actions to prevent disease

the same coronaviridae virus family in the host list several species of monkey macaque and cynomolgus have appeared in addition to pigs and bats the result is a proof-of-concept that bats are subjects of genetic research related to coronavirus the discovery of coronavirus strains in hosts like pangolin is a very recent discovery and is still under active research lam et al 2020  we further group the neighboring words of the gene subgraph into four categories host disease bio-molecular and miscellaneous the biomolecular category includes proteins cellular mechanisms drugs and biochemical compounds figure 4 shows the rank ordering of keywords of each category based on bc measurements interestingly cancer appears after sars influenza pneumonia which suggests a link between the genomic studies of cancer and virus the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv appears in the fifth position suggesting an important pathogen in the genetic study of flu viruses in the bimolecular category polymerase chain reaction pcr a mechanism used in molecular biology for testing coronavirus has ranked second after rna the abbreviation of interferon ifn appears fourth in this category and second in the miscellaneous keyword category which is a set of proteins released by the host in response to a virus attack in the host category mice rank the top followed by bat cat pig and a species of monkey macaque there are other potentially intriguing keywords in the ranking that will require more space and scope for further discussion we have developed a graph-based model to mine information for covid-19 research the major findings are as follows figure 4  rank ordering of the most influential keywords in the gene subgraph linked to the coronavirus node the subgraph keywords are grouped into

to rna viruses influenza ebola chikungunya and enterovirus e a drug nitazoxanide to inhibit cov-2 -all of which appear in our subgraph models and rank order we believe similar other keywords will intrigue the scientists to find repurposing candidates for covid-19 research despite promising findings there are several limitations of this study first high bc values of top ranked keywords may be partly attributed to their high prevalence in the literature there is a possibility that keywords in the lower rank order are less prevalent in the literature however low-ranked keywords can still be strong candidates for future covid-19 research second our analysis is limited to article abstracts without incorporating full article texts that can be a richer source of information third we do not use any explicit metric to evaluate our graph model performance and findings since this study is entirely exploratory fourth our graph model includes a broad array of diverse health science literature a grouping of research articles and subsequent analysis within individual subgroups may yield more focused results we leave these tasks for our future work this paper demonstrates one of the first studies on mining a large volume of health science literature in search of information for the ongoing battle against covid-19 the results presented in tables and figures under different topics effectively summarize the key information contents of the literature with the aid of a graph-based computational model and betweenness centrality based keyword ranking the proposed model has been able to recommend informative drug types pathogens hosts chemical and biomolecules for covid-19 research that may not always be evident to the concerned researchers the findings may be a useful reference guide to provoke new ideas and expedite new directions of research in the fight against the covid-19 pandemic  understanding sarscov2 endocytosis for covid19 drug repurposing oleg glebov o   at the time of writing this piece the pandemic of the atypical pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscoronavirus 2 cov2 has spread globally with more than 4 million cases and close to 300 000 deaths httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus this current epidemiological economical and potentially political disaster in the making follows in the wake of earlier outbreaks of respiratory infections sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers also caused by coronaviruses 1 there is currently no known cure for covid19 and available medical treatment is largely limited to alleviation of the respiratory dysfunction associated with the severe course of the disease as a result of this an enormous effort across biomedical sciences is mounting to develop therapeutic means of treating covid19 one key area of this development is vaccination as of may 11 there were five candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation with as many as 71 in preclinical stage 2 yet necessities of the research and development process dictate that none of the above  in the best possible scenario  will be clinically available earlier than in 18 months time 3 given the unprecedented scale of the current outbreak there is immense pressure to find faster and cheaper therapeutic solutions to this rapidly worsening global health crisis there is a broad agreement that perhaps the best way to produce an affordable treatment on a faster timescale is to repurpose existing drugs and much interest is directed this way especially focusing on drugs with previously demonstrated antiviral capabilities 4 however lack of the basic understanding of the cell biology of sarscov2 infection limits the efficacy of such an approach although recent years have yielded some insight into the cell biology of the related human virus sarscov and the two viruses may bind to the same surface receptor protein angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 5 6 7 8 their genomes still differ by 20 8 and the associated epidemiological picture is very different indeed furthermore the extent of ace2 protein expression in the airways is subject to some controversy 9 10 11 12 13 while preliminary evidence hints that other surface receptors may be involved in sarscov2 infection 14 the resulting gap in knowledge forms a major obstacle on the road towards effective drug repurposing for treating covid19 the critical step in any viral infection involves penetration of the viral particles into the cytosol to this end most viruses take advantage of the endocytic membrane trafficking of the host cell 15 while the canonical endocytic pathways in mammalian cells involve budding of clathrincoated vesicles through the action of a large gtpase dynamin there are also multiple pathways of noncanonical endocytosis such as caveolae flotillin1associated endocytosis clathrinindependent carrierglycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored proteinenriched endosomal compartment endocytosis and macropinocytosis 16 and viruses have been shown to use all of these 15 fig 1 mechanistic details of these pathways may vary considerably between cell types and diversity of endocytosis in airway epithelium is currently poorly understood understanding endocytic viral entry in the respiratory tract may therefore offer a promising therapeutic strategy to treat viral infections as far as coronaviruses are concerned current evidence suggests that the mode of entry can vary between viruses and host cell types and can include clathrindependent endocytosis 17 caveolae 18 and clathrin and caveolaeindependent mechanism involving lipid rafts 19 20 fusion at the cell surface while proposed as a potential entry mechanism 5 was not directly demonstrated both sarscov and sarscov2 appear to require endocytosis in cultured cell lines 6 19 20 21 and sarscov may be endocytosed via more than one pathway depending on the cell line 19 21 however there is little knowledge regarding the details of the epidemiologically relevant mode of viral entry that is in the human lung it is therefore imperative to consider sarscov2 endocytic trafficking in context of the correct host cell type preliminary evidence suggests that infection with sarscov2 may begin in the upper respiratory tract for example in the nasal epithelium which expresses the highest levels of sarscov2 receptors 10 the most significant morbidity and indeed mortality however appear to be associated with a further severe stage of the disease when infection spreads to the lower airways of the lung resulting in respiratory failure and possibly multiorgan failure due to cytokine storm 22 although the histopathology data are still scant two case studies and preliminary findings from a primate disease model indicate that the lower airway sarscov2 infection may specifically affect the alveolar epithelial cells termed pneumocytes 23 24 25 clearly blockade of the sarscov2 entry at either of these stages is likely to yield considerable therapeutic benefits to establish which endocytic pathways are likely to operate in nasal epithelial cells and pneumocytes some clues can be gleaned from the local expression profile for the key endocytic proteins as evidenced by the human protein atlas httpswwwproteinatlasorg nasal epithelial cells abundantly express a wide variety of endocytic markers suggesting the presence of multiple active pathways in agreement with ultrastructural evidence 26 conversely pneumocytes show a more restricted expression pattern with some key proteins associated with conventional endocytosis either low or missing importantly a large gtpase dynamin which is required for endocytosis through clathrincoated vesicles and caveolae is abundant in nasal epithelium but undetectable in pneumocytes in contrast there are mediumtohigh expression levels of proteins involved in macropinocytosis such as cterminal binding protein ctbp1  2 and p21activated kinase 1 therefore macropinocytosis may be an important endocytic pathway in pneumocytes the potentially distinct endocytic profile of upper and lower airways is reflected in the relevant infection mechanisms for known pathogens upper respiratory epithelium can be infected by numerous airborne pathogens through multiple pathways of dynamindependent and dynaminindependent endocytosis 15 conversely pneumocyte infection is much less well understood however entry through macropinocytosis has been consistently demonstrated for airborne bacterial and viral pathogens such as mycobacterium tuberculosis 27 francisella tularensis 28 influenza a virus 29 adenovirus adenovirus serotype 35 30 and haemophilus influenzae 31 as well as for various nanoparticles 32 33 intriguingly macropinocytosis in an alveolar epithelial cell line is upregulated by waterpipe smoke condensate suggesting a possible mechanism underlying association of covid19 morbidity with smoking 34 taken together the above evidence suggests that sarscov2 may employ distinct endocytic pathways for cell entry in the upper and lower respiratory tract fig 1 what are these pathways to address this question directly we need to investigate the cell biology of sarscov2 endocytosis in detail a suitable starting model for initial investigation of sarscov2 endocytosis can involve established immortalised cell lines derived from the respiratory tract epithelium httpswwwatccorgmediapdfscancer20and20normal20cell20lines20tableslung20cancer20and20normal20cell20linesashx these lines provide several key methodological advantages they are wellcharacterised easy to maintain using standard cell culture protocols and retain the key characteristics of the primary cell type of origin for emulation of the respiratory tract environment the cell lines can be grown in an airliquid interface culture as described before 35 36 immortalised cell cultures offer a simple and costeffective platform for investigation of cell biology there are however important caveats associated with immortalised cell cultures in vitro which need addressing and further validation one key consideration is expression profile in which a cell line may be different from that in the original tissue this can be especially relevant with regard to membrane trafficking where discrepancy in expression of certain key proteins may affect the organisation of the whole network for example the lung cell line a549 can express multiple isoforms of dynamin 37 which is not the case in pneumocytes in human lung tissue as a result of this any findings arising from the cell lines will need to be investigated further in a more expensive but clinically relevant system of primary cells cell preparations for both lower and upper respiratory tract are commercially available 38 39 preliminary evidence shows that such systems can be efficiently infected with sarscov2 40 alternatively cells can be directly obtained from human subjects for example nasal epithelium or alveolar epithelial cells can be isolated from surgically resected lung tissue material 41 regardless of that validation of findings in primary cells will be a key step in investigation investigation of membrane trafficking of sarscov2 requires a probe that can adequately recapitulate the intracellular itinerary of the virus using active clinically isolated live virus samples would of course allow a closest approximation however a major drawback of this approach is a highly infectious nature of the virus necessitating the use of a biosafety level 3 laboratory an alternative approach would involve pseudoviruses combining viral surface proteins responsible for cell receptor binding the lack of sarscov2 genetic material renders them incapable of replication allowing work in a biosafety level 2 laboratory pseudoviruses have been successfully used before to investigate trafficking of sarscov and merscov 5 19 and sarscov2 pseudovirus models have been recently published 6 7 for infection the viral probe will be added to the cells for different lengths of time in order to determine the endocytic pathways involved in sarscov2 endocytosis one can employ standard methods of multicolour fluorescence immunocytochemistry light microscopy and colocalisation analysis the proportion of the internalised virus colocalising with the classical markers of membrane trafficking compartments will indicate the intracellular itinerary of the virus 42 for this approach multiple wellcharacterised antibody markers for intracellular compartments for example early endosomes late endosomes and lysosomes are available for a more detailed investigation of the endocytic route of the virus viral infection can be combined with uptake of typical cargoes for different endocytic pathways this approach would allow tracking of the virus in relation to other endocytic pathways and also to investigate the effect of viral infection on the general membrane trafficking network of the host cell suitable cargo molecules include transferrin for clathrindependent endocytosis 43 cholera toxin b subunit for caveolae 44 and dextran for fluidphase macropinocytosis and flotillindependent endocytosis 45 what is the relative contribution of different endocytic pathways to sarscov2 infection to address this question lossoffunction analysis can be performed involving knockdown of the key regulatory proteins for different endocytic pathways for example dynamin 2 caveolin1 flotillin1 and ctbp 16 44 fig 1 the resulting findings can be further corroborated using available pharmacological blockers of endocytic pathways including dynasore and pitstop for clathrindependent endocytosis nystatin for caveolae methylbetacyclodextrin for dynaminindependent endocytosis and amiloride for macropinocytosis however care must be exercised in interpretation of these results due to the offtarget effects of these agents in which endocytic pathways other than the target pathway may be inhibited 46 47 48 taken together the combination of adequate cell models with the newly developed sarscov2 toolkit and established tools of membrane trafficking research is wellpoised to deliver a key insight into the mechanisms underlying covid19 infection two broad approaches to developing drugs against sarscov2 involve targeting the biology of the host versus targeting the biology of the virus one clear drawback associated with global perturbation of a general cell biological function is the potential for unwelcome side effects whether in the same target tissue or elsewhere in the body conversely a key advantage of focusing on the cell biological mechanism is the relatively immutability of the host cell compared to virus which may evolve drug resistance due to its high mutation rate 49 50 furthermore considering that various viruses may use the same endocytic pathways of the host cell 15 targeting viral entry at the point of endocytosis holds a more general promise for the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs 51 once the endocytic route of sarscov2 in primary lung epithelial cells has been established this insight can be capitalised upon for translational needs specifically a cellbased model of sarscov2 infection 40 will lend itself to establishment of a screening platform for drug development aiming to identify compounds capable of blocking or hindering sarscov2 endocytic entry there is already vivid interest in chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine two related drugs that may block viral entry through endosomal acidification fig 1 although evidence for their effectiveness is currently scant and safety hazards are a major concern 4 52 53 of note compounds showing even partial blockade of sarscov2 endocytosis may be of value as clinical evidence suggests that viral load may correlate with the severity of the disease progression largescale screening of this sort will require considerable time and effort in the meantime a shortterm screening of a limited number of candidate drugs is highly warranted to this end the range of candidates can be limited to the following 11 approved drugs table 1 fig 1 although most of these drugs are not currently prescribed against infection they have shown ability to block various pathways of endocytosis in cell culture and may therefore have potential for blocking sarscov2 endocytosis another addition to this list is a cholesterol chelating agent methylbetacyclodextrin used as a carrier to enhance bioavailability in drug formulations and generally recognised as safe by the food and drug administration usa importantly 5 out of 11 drugs chlorpromazine nystatin amiloride vinblastine and itraconazole are on the world health organizations list of essential medicines ensuring their wide availability across the world also several of the above have been tested or are being tested for topical delivery into the respiratory tract table 1 these factors will be favourable for the rapid integration of the successful drugs into global clinical practice subject to development of relevant clinical and epidemiological applications despite frenzied efforts to find effective treatments for covid19 very little is currently known about the fundamental cell biology of the sarscov2 infection the pivotal event underpinning sarscov2 infection is likely endocytosis of viral particles therefore blockade of this process may provide for a major therapeutic breakthrough the tools of membrane trafficking research can be readily applied to rapidly characterise the endocytic route of virus entry in a cellbased model of disease providing a key insight into the disease mechanism fig 1 crucially the same model can be used as a screening platform for rapid repurposing of existing approved drugs as blockers of sarscov2 endocytic entry table 1 in the longer term insight into the poorly understood membrane trafficking mechanisms of the airway epithelium will aid development of novel drugs the generalised strategy of targeting the membrane trafficking of the host cell biology to prevent viral infection holds great promise for future therapeutic applications considering the existence of other zoonotic coronaviruses capable of binding to human cells 54 more broadly rapid repurposing of approved drugs in cellbased screening platforms is poised to play an instrumental role in futureproofing global health care against the interspecies transmission events in the age of unparalleled spending on pharmaceutical research and development humankind cannot afford to neglect one of its most valuable allies in the fight against the current and the future pandemics  the basic foundations of human cell biology the authors declare no conflict of interest  drug repurposing screens reveal fda approved drugs active against sars-cov-2 mark dittmar jae lee seung kanupriya whig elisha segrist minghua li kellie jurado kirandeep samby holly ramage david schultz sara cherry  there are an urgent need for antivirals to treat the newly emerged sars-cov-2 to identify new candidates we screened a repurposing library of 3000 drugs screening in vero cells found few antivirals while screening in human huh75 cells validated 23 diverse antiviral drugs extending our studies to lung epithelial cells we found that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by sars-cov-2 in these cells entry in lung epithelial calu-3 cells is ph-independent and requires tmprss2 while entry in vero and huh75 cells requires low ph and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases moreover we found 9 drugs are antiviral in lung cells 7 of which have been tested in humans and 3 are fda approved including cyclosporine which we found is targeting cyclophilin rather than calcineurin for its antiviral activity these antivirals reveal essential host targets and have the potential for rapid clinical implementation  coronaviruses represent a large group of medically relevant viruses were historically associated with the common cold however in recent years members of the coronavirus family have emerged from animal reservoirs into humans and have caused novel diseases 1 first severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov emerged in china in 2003 followed by middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov in 2012 2 3  while sars was in the end eradicated mers continues to cause infections in the middle east beginning in december 2019 into continuing into january 2020 it became clear that a new respiratory virus was spreading in wuhan china rapid sequencing efforts revealed a coronavirus closely related to sars and was named sars-cov-2 4 unfortunately this virus is highly infectious and has spread rapidly around the world identification of broadly acting sars-cov-2 antivirals is essential to clinically address sars-cov-2 infections a potential route to candidate antivirals is through the deployment of drugs that show activity against related viruses previous studies found that the antiviral drug remdesivir which was developed against the rna-dependent rna polymerase of ebola virus was also active against sars-cov-2 in vitro with promising results in clinical trials 5 6 7  chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine are approved for use in malaria and many in vitro studies have found that these drugs are also active against coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 8 9  this led to early adoption of these agents to treat covid-19 the disease caused by sars-cov-2 infection however little efficacy of these agents has been demonstrated in subsequent clinical trials 10  it remains unclear why these agents have not been more active in humans there are currently more than 3000 fda approved drugs and many others that have been tested in humans we created an in-house library of 3059 drugs including 1000 fda approved drugs and 2100 drug-like molecules against defined molecular targets with validated pharmacological activity in addition we purchased drugs with reported anti-sars-cov-2 activity eg remdesivir viruses encode unique proteins essential for infection and most approved antivirals target these virally encoded essential targets this class of antivirals has been termed direct-acting antivirals viruses are also dependent on host cellular machineries for successful infection and drugs that block these activities are host-targeted antivirals given our dearth of effective treatments we developed a screening platform that would allow us to identify both direct-acting and host-targeted antivirals that can be potentially repurposed for use against sars-cov-2 11 we developed a specific and sensitive assay to quantify viral infection using a cell-based highcontent approach we began our studies in african green monkey cercopithecus aethiops kidney epithelial cells vero because they are routinely used to propagate sars-cov-2 they are robustly infected and thus vero cells are widely used as a model system to screen for antivirals 8 12 13 14  we screened our in-house repurposing library identifying only six drugs that were antiviral with low toxicity in the primary screen given how few candidates emerged we reasoned that human cells might be a better model of infection and thus tested a panel of human cell lines to identify cells that are easy to grow and permissive to infection we found that the human hepatocyte cell line huh75 was readily infected with sars-cov-2 screening in this human cell line we validated 23 drugs that were active in dose-response experiments and showed a favorable selective index versus toxicity 15  these candidates targeted a wide variety of cellular activities but few were active in vero cells however one class the chloroquines and their derivatives were active in both cell types the entry pathway of sars-cov-2 has only begun to be elucidated with much of what we know being inferred from studies of the related sars-cov-1 16 17  the coronavirus glycoprotein or spike requires proteolytic processing for entry 16 18 19  this processing can occur outside the cell or within the endolysosomal compartment 16 19  both sars-cov-1 and -2 engage angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their plasma membrane receptor 20 21 22  upon binding the viruses along with the receptor are endocytosed into the cell into a low ph endosomal compartment where there are proteases including cathepsins that can cleave spike and allow for entry into the cytosol 23 24 25  since cathepsins require a low ph for activity chloroquine and its derivatives that neutralize this low ph can effectively block viral entry 23 24 25  recent studies have also identified a plasma membrane-associated serine protease tmprss2 is active against spike cleaving the protein extracellularly thereby bypassing the requirement for endosomal proteases 26 27 28  whether sars-cov-2 enters through different routes in different cell types remains unclear lung epithelial cells are the major cellular target for sars-cov-2 in vivo and have been used to explore the role of tmprss2 in infection perhaps surprisingly while we found remdesivir was antiviral in calu-3 hydroxychloroquine was not since a panel of quinolines had no activity in calu-3 cells these data suggest that entry in lung epithelial cells is independent of low-ph processing in the endosomal compartment in contrast the tmprss2 inhibitor camostat was highly active in calu-3 cells but inactive in vero and huh75 cells these data demonstrate distinct modes of entry in lung cells 21  further these data suggest that there may be other fundamentally different cellular requirements in different cell types we screened our 23 validated candidates in calu-3 cells and found only 9 drugs showed activity including 3 fda approved drugs cyclosporine dacomitinib and salinomycin in additional studies we found that cyclosporine analogs that target cyclophilin a were active against sars-cov-2 but not compounds that target calcineurin identifying broadly acting antivirals is essential to move forward with clinical treatments for sars-cov-2 vero cells are permissive to infection and can be used for antiviral screening for direct acting antivirals sars-cov-2 is routinely propagated in vero e6 cells 12 14 26  when growing the virus in either vero e6 or vero ccl81 cells two different strains of vero cells from atcc we observed that sars-cov-2 is cytopathic in vero e6 but not in vero ccl81 data not shown 12  moreover viral stocks propagated from either of these cells produced similar titers of virus 1x10 7 pfuml suggesting that viral replication and cytotoxicity are separable therefore we set out to develop a quantitative microscopy-based assay to measure the level of replication of sars-cov-2 more directly in infected cells and we chose vero ccl81 to uncouple toxicity from infection we first validated that our antibodies could detect infection of sars-cov-2 we used an antibody to dsrna and to sars-cov-2 spike figure 1a  29 30  we created an in-house library of 3059 drugs purchased from selleckchem this library contains 1000 fda approved drugs and 2100 drug-like molecules against defined molecular targets with validated pharmacological activity the library contains 678 known kinase inhibitors 435 annotated cancer therapeutics 190 epigenetic regulators 411 anti-viralinfectives 596 gpcr and ion channel regulators the remaining compounds falling into diverse target classes we next optimized the dose and timing of infection by performing dose-response studies with known antivirals indeed we found that hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir were active in vero cells and presented with little cytotoxicity at the active doses  figure 1b 8  next we validated the assay metrics and observed a z07  figure s1  31  we used this assay pipeline to screen our in-house repurposing library in 384 well plates at a final concentration of 1 m  figure 1c  32  we quantified the percentage of infected cells as well as the total cell number per well to allow for exclusion of toxic compounds we robustly identified the positive control remdesivir as antiviral  figure s1  8  using a threshold of 40 infection and 80 viability as compared to the vehicle control we identified only six drugs that were antiviral in our primary screen table s1  this included the natural product nanchangmycin which we previously found in a drug repurposing screen against zika virus 32  nanchangmycin was broadly antiviral against viruses that enter cells through endocytosis consistent with the role of endosomal acidification for sars-cov-2 entry in these cells 32  we then repurchased powders and validated four of these candidates in a dose-response assays where we observed antiviral activity in the absence of toxicity figure 1d  since vero cells are derived from african green monkeys we set out to identify a human cell line permissive to infection to this end we infected a panel of human cell lines with sars-cov-2 and monitored infection by microscopy we initially tested a549 calu-1 huh7 huh75 hepg2 hacat imr90 nci-h292 cfbe41o and u2os cells we detected less than 1 infection of a549 calu-1 huh7 hepg2 hacat imr90 nci-h292 cfbe41o and u2os cells data not shown interestingly while huh7 were largely non-permissive the derivative cell line huh75 cells was permissive to sars-cov-2 fig 2a  huh75 cells are defective in innate immune signaling rig-i and are known to be more permissive to many viruses including hepatitis c virus 15  remdesivir and hydroxylchloroquine were antiviral against sars-cov-2 in huh75 cells with ic50s that were greater than 10-fold lower than those observed in vero cells fig 2b  we also found that nanchangmycin was antiviral against sars-cov-2 in huh75 cells fig s2 these observations suggest that huh75 cells may be more sensitive to some classes of inhibitors and may reveal antivirals that are selectively active against human targets we optimized our image-based assay in huh75 cells using remdesivir and observed a z061  fig s3 31  we screened our repurposing library at 500nm quantifying both the percentage of infected cells as well as cell number to exclude toxic compounds fig 2c  we found 33 drugs had antiviral activity in the absence of cytotoxicity 40 infection 80 viability as compared to vehicle control table s2  this included three of the six drugs identified in vero cells z-fa-fmk y-320 and salinomycin we repurchased powders for 32 drugs and tested their activity in dose-response assays in huh75 cells against sars-cov-2 cell number and the percent of infected cells were quantified remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine were used as positive controls and vehicle controls dmso was included as a negative control 8  of those tested 23 drugs showed activity and fell into diverse classes fig 2d  dose-response curves are shown for 23 candidates and the ic50s and cc50s were calculated fig 2e  the selectivity index si ratio between antiviral and cytotoxicity potencies was calculated and the 23 candidates were antiviral with si3  figure 2e  table s3  dose-responses curves for the other candidates that did not validate in huh75 cells are shown in fig s4 direct-acting antivirals are likely to be active against the virus in multiple cell types as was observed for remdesivir in addition host-directed antivirals that target key steps in the viral lifecycle and are highly conserved and broadly expressed are also likely to emerge across cell types one example is the endosomal acidification blocker hydroxychloroquine which indeed scored as antiviral in both cell types 9 23 24  in total we identified three drugs as antiviral in both screens we performed dose-responses in vero cells against the candidates from the huh75 screen we found that 5 additional compounds were antiviral in vero cells with a si3 azd8055 bix01294 ebastine mg-132 and wye-125132 albeit at higher concentrations  figure s5  however the majority of the antivirals that were validated in huh75 cells were not active in vero cells we next focused on lung epithelial models as these are the most relevant to human infections we found that a number of lung-derived epithelial cell lines were refractory to infection eg a549 calu-1 nci-h292 cfbe41o however we found that calu-3 cells that have been shown to be permissive for many coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 were highly readily infected fig 3a 14 26 33  we optimized assays using calu-3 cells and tested their sensitivity to remdesivir and hydroxycholorquine as expected we found that while the direct acting antiviral remdesivir was antiviral however hydroxychloroquine had little or no activity in calu-3 cells fig 3b  this led us to test the antiviral activity of a panel of chloroquine derivatives and we found that none of these had activity against sars-cov-2 fig 3c  while these compounds are antiviral in both vero cells and huh75 cells fig 3d  this suggests that there are major differences in the requirement for endosomal acidification during infection of sars-cov-2 in lung epithelial cells endosomal acidification is thought to be required for sars-cov-2 entry to maintain the low ph necessary for endosomal cysteine protease activity required for priming spike for membrane fusion 26  consistent with the requirement for acidification in vero and huh75 the cathepsin inhibitor z-fa-fmk emerged as antiviral in both cell types fig 1d fig 2e  we tested z-fa-fmk in calu-3 cells and found that it had no antiviral activity fig 3d  consistent with a lack of a requirement for endosomal acidification recent studies found the plasma membraneassociated serine protease tmprss2 can prime the viral glycoprotein for entry in lung epithelial cells 26  therefore we tested the role of tmprss2 by treating cells with the inhibitor camostat we found that camostat was antiviral in calu-3 cells but had no activity in either vero or huh75 cells figure 3e -f 26  moreover the main endosomal kinase phosphatidylinositiol-3-phosphatephosphatidylinositol 5-kinase pikfyve promotes internalization of diverse viruses and was recently shown to impact entry of coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 in hela cells 34  using the pikfyve inhibitor apilimod we found that pikfyve promotes infection of sars-cov-2 in huh75 and vero cells with little importance calu-3 cells  fig s6  these data suggest that the entry pathway used by sars-cov-2 is cell-type specific to determine which of the 23 antiviral candidates validated in huh75 cells also had antiviral activity in calu-3 cells we performed dose-response studies we found that 9 drugs were antiviral against sars-cov-2 in calu-3 cells with a selectivity index greater than 2 fig 4  these include two drugs with unclear targets salinomycin y-320 kinase inhibitors azd8055 bemcentinib dacomitinib wye-125132 histamine receptor inhibitor ebastine iron chelator dp44mt and the cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporine many kinase inhibitors were quite potent suggesting an important role in intracellular signaling for infection the other drugs tested in calu-3 with a si3 are shown in fig s7 the full table of candidates from the huh75 screen with ic50 cc50 and si are shown in figure s8  cyclosporine is an fda approved generic drug that is readily available and showed a submicromolar ic50 with high selectivity in both huh75 and calu-3 cells fig 3 fig 4 fig s8  cyclosporine binds cyclophilin a and prevents activation of the phosphatase calcineurin which is required for the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat 35 36 37  inhibition of this pathway in t cells is used as an immunosuppressant 38  cyclosporins have been shown to have antiviral activity against a wide variety of viruses including other coronaviruses 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52  the activity of cyclosporine against previously studied coronaviruses is cyclophilin-dependent and independent of calcineurin 50 51  we set out to perform initial structure-activity relationships sar and to determine if this activity was through its inhibition of cyclophilin or inhibition of calcineurin for these studies we obtained a panel of cyclosporine analogs including cyclosporin a cyclosporin b cyclosporin c cyclosporin h and isocyclosoporin a 53 we found that isocyclosporin a cyclosporin a cyclosporin b and cyclosporin c were active with increasing ic50s fig 5a-c  cyclosporine h shows only weak binding to cyclophilin a and has no immunosuppressant activity as it does not inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin 53 54  cyclosporin h has a log reduction in activity compared to cyclosporine but retains some activity psc 833 is a non-immunosuppressant derivative of cyclosporine that does not inhibit calcineurin has a similar activity to cyclosporin c55 tmn355 is a cyclophilin a inhibitor that is 27 times more potent than cyclosporine a in inhibiting the prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilin a 56  we found the latter to lack antiviral activity suggesting that the enzymatic activity of cyclophilin a is dispensable we further validated that cyclosporine is antiviral in both cell types by performing rt-qpcr fig  5d  in addition nim811 is another non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine derivative of cyclosporine and we found that it is potently antiviral fig 5e  further suggesting that the antiviral activity is cyclophilin-dependent and separable from calcineurin strikingly the activity of this panel of drugs are similar in the two cell lines these data suggest that cyclosporine has the same target and mechanism-of-action we also found that none of these drugs are antiviral in vero cells  figure s9  to further assess the mechanism by which cyclosporine is antiviral we tested fk506 an inhibitor of calcineurin fk506 binds the related immunophilin fkbp rather than cyclophilin a to block the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and thus is also a potent immunosuppressant 57  we found that fk506 has no activity against sars-cov-2 fig 5a-c  moreover since one of the major targets of calcineurin is the activation of nfat we also tested whether an nfat inhibitor impacted viral infection 58  we found that the nfat inhibitor had no effect on infection fig 5a-c  altogether we found that cyclosporins are potent antivirals against sars-cov-2 in lung epithelial cells and that this activity is independent of calcineurin and nfat the emergence of sars-cov-2 has led to devastating global morbidity and mortality creating an immediate need for new therapeutics and vaccines repurposing existing drugs can allow for rapid deployment of therapeutics that have already been tested in humans 59  remdesivir was developed against the ebola virus rna-dependent rna polymerase and was also found to have robust activity against sars-cov-2 8  importantly we found that remdesivir is active against sars-cov-2 across cell types chloroquine and hydroxychlorquine have been used for decades to treat malaria and have been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 8 9  however we find that this antiviral activity is cell-type specific lung epithelial cells are resistant to these drugs and this may explain the lack of efficacy seen in many trials 10  to determine if there are additional drugs that are active against sars-cov-2 in vitro we screened a repurposing library that includes 1000 fda approved drugs and 1000 additional drugs that have been tested in humans repurposing can be used to reveal new and similar pathways and targets but also the time and monetary investment associated with repurposing is potentially less since these drugs often bypass phase-1 trials 60 61  initial screens in vero cells yielded few active drugs leading us to pursue a screen in human huh75 cells a transformed hepatocyte line deficient in innate immune signaling using this model system we identified 33 drugs and validated 23 with dose-response assays this includes many drugs that were previously shown to have activity against other coronaviruses tetrandrine cepharanthine cyclosporine alixostatin mg132 salinomycin and sars-cov-2 salinomycin tetrandrine cepharanthine cyclosporine ebastine 13 40 50 54 62 63 64 65 66 67 68  the 23 drugs fall into distinct classes and most have known targets however two drugs that were active across cell types salinomycin and y-320 do not have clear targets salinomycin is a polyether antibiotic and chemotherapy drug that has been shown to be antiviral against many viruses including coronaviruses 13 68 69 70  salinomycin was also identified in a vero cell screen 13  mechanistically some studies have suggested that salinomycin is an ionophore that can attenuate viral entry by disrupting the acidification of the endosome 71  other studies have implicated salinomycin in er stress 72  studies in mice have shown antiviral activity against influenza 71  salinomycin has also been characterized as an activator of autophagy which may influence sars-cov-2 infection 73 74 75 y-320 is a phenylpyrazoleanilide immunomodulatory agent that has been shown to inhibit il-17 production by t cells and has activity in monkeys 76  interestingly treatment with y-320 is associated with decreased il-6 production a cytokine that is thought to be highly expressed in sars-cov-2 infection 76 77 78  however it is unclear how y-320 could attenuate sars-cov-2 in non-immune cells ebastine is a potent h1-histamine receptor antagonist used for allergic disorders outside of the us particularly in asia 79 we found that ebastine is antiviral in all three cell types although 10-fold less active in vero cells 13  ebastine is orally available with few side effects and there are there clinical trials underway in china testing whether ebastine can impact covid-19 outcomes 80  since other h1-histamine receptor antagonists were not active it is unclear why this particular agent is more effective at inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection interestingly ebastine and its active metabolite carebastine are reported to inhibit expression of il-6 while many other h1-histamine receptor antagonists do not 81 82  we also identified 6 protease inhibitors as antiviral in huh75 cells two cysteine protease inhibitors z-fa-fmk and mg-132 had activity in both vero and huh75 cells none of the protease inhibitors were active in calu-3 cells this observation suggests that they are not targeting the viral proteases consistent with this z-fa-fmk is an inhibitor of cathepsins which are required for sars-cov-2 entry in cells where endosomal proteases are required for spike cleavage and thus we observe no requirement in calu-3 cells where tmprss2 is required for infection 16 19 26 27 28 this has important implications in diverse sars-cov-2 studies where there may be cell-type specific requirements for different steps in the replication cycle we also identified two inhibitors against the cellular histone methyltransferase g9a as antiviral in huh75 cells however these drugs were not active in calu-3 cells suggesting that there are cell type specific requirements am1241 is a selective cannabinoid cb2 receptor agonist that we found was antiviral in huh75 cells gw842166x another cb2 agonist that has a 10-fold higher ec50 was not active moreover dose-response studied found that am1241 is not active in either vero or calu-3 cells cepharanthine and tetrandrine are both bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids produced as natural products from herbal plants 83  tetrandrine a traditional chinese medicine and calcium channel blocker has been shown to antagonize calmodulin it has anti-tumor and antiinflammatory effects and can effectively inhibit fibroblasts thereby inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis 84 85  multiple studies have suggested that tetrandrine has antiviral activity including against dengue virus and herpes simplex 1 virus 86 87  tetrandrine has also been shown to inhibit entry of ebola virus into host cells in vitro and showed therapeutic efficacy against ebola in preliminary studies on mice 88  currently there is an ongoing clinical trial using tetrandrine in covid-19 patients to improve pulmonary function 80  cepharanthine is reported to have antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory properties and is used to treat a variety of acute and chronic conditions outside of the us 89  both cepharanthine and tetrandrine were previously shown to have antiviral activity against the human coronavirus oc43 and in recent studies on sars-cov-2 in vero cell screens 13 62 63  while both of these molecules were antiviral in our huh75 screen neither were active in calu-3 cells this may suggest that they are modulating endosomal entry pathways we identified few metabolic regulators dp44mt is a potent iron chelator that we found to be antiviral against sars-cov-2 in huh 75 and calu-3 cells 56  a clinical trial with the iron chelator deferoxamine is underway nct04333550 however other iron chelators in our library deferasirox and deferiprone were not identified as antiviral making the mechanism of action unclear we identified several kinase inhibitors as antivirals against sars-cov-2 frax486 is a p21activated kinase pak inhibitor that is antiviral in huh75 cells but only modestly impacted infection of calu-3 cells 90  other pak inhibitors were not identified in our screens pak is required for entry by many viruses91 pd0166285 is a potent wee1 and chk1 inhibitor that is antiviral in huh75 cells but shows strong toxicity in calu-3 cells 92 we also found three mtor inhibitors azd8055 pf-04691502 and wye-125132 are antiviral against sars-cov-2 in huh-7 and calu-3 cells these are highly potent atp competitive mtor inhibitors that target both torc1 and torc2 in our library none of the rapamycin analogs that selectively inhibit mtorc1 were active we also identified two potent selective and irreversible inhibitors of egfr dacomitinib and naquotinib the other 44 egfr inhibitors showed no activity in huh75 cells importantly dacomitinib is a potent antiviral in calu-3 cells it is unclear if the target is indeed egfr but for many viruses egfr activation promotes viral entry which may also be the case for sars-cov-2 93-97 cyclosporine is a commonly used immunosuppressant that binds cyclophilin a and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin which is required for the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat 35 36 37 38 41  inhibition of this pathway in t cells is used as an immunosuppressant we found that cyclosporine is active in both huh75 and calu-3 cells but has no activity in vero cells nor did the cyclosporine analogs a recent screen in vero cells did find activity with cyclosporine against sars-cov-2 13  cyclophilin a is a ubiquitously expressed peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase 102 cyclophilin a and other cyclophilins have chaperone-like activity and take part in protein-folding processes 103  cyclophilin a has been shown to be an important cellular factor that facilitated many diverse viral infections this includes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 influenza virus hepatitis c virus hcv hepatitis b virus hbv vesicular stomatitis virus vsv vaccinia virus vv severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and rotavirus rv 41-49 104 105  the coronaviruses hcov-229e hcov-nl63 fpiv mouse hepatitis virus mhv avian infectious bronchitis virus and sars-cov have been found to be attenuated by cyclosporin a 40 64 106  cyclosporine and its non-immunosuppressive derivatives can inhibit replication of a number of viruses including some coronaviruses in most cases the responsible cyclophilin is cypa 54 105 but cypa and cypb were found to be required for fcov replication 106  for hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e cyclophilin a is required for infection in caco-2 cells 50 and huh-75 cells respectively 51 52  it is generally thought that the activity of cyclosporine against coronaviruses is cyclophilin-dependent and independent of calcineurin we found that a number of cyclosporins were antiviral with similar potencies including cyclosporine cyclosporin a cyclosporin b and the metabolic breakdown product of cyclosporin a isoscyclosporin a we also found that cyclophilin a is likely required as cyclosporin h which is a weak binder had reduced activity however the enzymatic activity of cyclophilin a is likely dispensable as tmn355 was inactive to further address the role of calcineurin we tested a non-immunosuppressant derivative of cyclosporine that does not inhibit calcineurin has a similar activity to cyclosporin c we also found that fk506 a calcineurin inhibitor independent of cyclophilin a and nfat inhibitors also have no antiviral activity altogether we found that cyclosporins are potent antivirals against sars-cov-2 in lung epithelial cells and that this activity is independent of calcineurins nim811 is a cyclophilin inhibitor independent of calcineurin and we found that this is highly active in huh75 cells further suggesting that cyclophilin is required for sars-covo-2 infection strikingly the activities of all of these drugs is similar in the two cell lines suggesting the same target and mechanism-of-action and that cyclosporine would block sars-cov-2 in diverse infected tissues in vivo one approach would be to use cyclophilin inhibitors that do not have immunosuppressive activity such as nim811 or others that have been tested for hcv infection alisporivir debio-025 and scy-635 107 or for hiv infection nim818 108 54  another possibility is to use cyclophilin inhibitors that also target calcineurin eg cyclosporine one of the major complications of covid-19 is the hyper-inflammatory response and cytokine storm associated with increased immune activation to prevent hyper-activation there has been interest in treating covid-19 patients with immunosuppressants 109 there are ongoing trials for a variety of agents including anti-il6 and jak inhibitors two clinical trials using sirolimus the fda approved mtor inhibitor which selectively inhibits mtorc1 we find no antiviral activity of sirolimus or other rapamycin derivatives in contrast cyclosporin a is an approved immunosuppressant that we found is also antiviral at concentrations achieved in vivo 110  therefore it may be useful to implement clinical trials using cyclosporin a as an immunosuppressant as it would potentially ameliorate symptoms by two mechanisms 111  there have been a large number of screens posted in the literature that suggest antiviral activity of several existing drugs eg azithromycin faviprivir lopinavir ribavirin and ritonavir tetracycline etc these drugs and most screens have been performed in vero cells with toxicity as read-outs medicines for malaria venture mmv has compiled a list of drugs that has support for antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 httpswwwmmvorgmmv-opencovid-box we tested 60 of the 80 compounds and find that in addition to the quinolines and drugs found in our screen there are few additional compounds that show activity at less than 2 um while it is possible that some of these drugs are false negatives in our screens it is likely that many of these candidates do not have antiviral activity when either measuring viral antigen production or when looking in different cell types it is very important that identified antivirals be tested for their impact on viral replication more directly moreover given the striking differences in sensitivities across cell types it is important to validate the activity of any new antivirals in lung epithelial cells altogether these studies highlight the roles of cellular genes in viral infection cell type differences and our discovery of nine broadly active antivirals suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions we found that of the 9 drugs are antiviral in lung epithelial cells 7 have been used in humans 3 of these are fda approved in the us cyclosporine dacomitinib and salinomycin and ebastine is approved outside of the us while clinical trials are underway with some of these candidates additional trials will be needed to determine the efficacy of these antivirals in covid-19 patients to inform future treatment strategies vero e6 cells and vero ccl81 were obtained from atcc and were cultured in dmem

montague bwf for funding   computational studies of drug repurposing and synergism of lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir binding with sars-cov-2 protease against covid-19 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has caused a major outbreak in humans all over the world and it is the latest pandemic in the series of other infectious diseases the concept of drug repurposing has been used successfully for many years for known diseases considering the emergency and urgency drug repurposing concept is being explored for coronavirus disease covid-19 as well recently the combination of three known drugs lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir has been proposed to control the virulence to a great extent in covid-19 affected patients within 48 hours hence we tried to understand the effect of synergism of these drugs against the sars-cov-2 protease using sequential docking studies as a result combination of three drugs showed a better binding energy than that of individual drugs further the complex was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to get insights into the stability of the complex considering the simultaneous interactions between three drugs and the protein the protein complexed with three drugs remained stable during the simulations hence these drugs can be explored further for drug repurposing against the successful inhibition of covid-19 muralidharan nisha

sarah kolitz jason funt renan escalante chong scott barrett rebecca kusko ben zeskind howard kaufman   coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the nidovirales order and have been divided into four broad groups ie alpha beta gamma delta based initially on serology and later by phylogenetic clustering 1 to date seven human coronaviruses restricted to the alpha and beta subgroups have been identified with the first infection reported in 1967 and thought to be associated with mild self-limited respiratory illness 2 more recently coronaviruses have been involved in 1530 of upper respiratory tract infections annually with more severe clinical courses in neonates older individuals and immunosuppressed patients in 2002 an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in guangdong china was traced to sars-cov a new beta-coronavirus during this outbreak nearly 8100 patients were diagnosed with an overall mortality of 9 which increased to 50 in patients over 60 years of age 3 the disease was thought to have originated from infected bats and was easily contained as transmission appeared to require direct contact with infected individuals a distinct group 2c b-coronavirus genetically related to bat coronaviruses was responsible for another outbreak in saudi arabia in 2012 and the disease was termed middle east respiratory syndrome mers this virus was associated with an initial 50 mortality but did not spread appreciably outside the region 4 an outbreak of an unknown respiratory illness in wuhan china was reported in late december of 2019 and the causative agent was identified as sars coronavirus sars-cov-2 and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 5 the disease has rapidly become a global pandemic and a major priority has been placed on finding drugs that prevent or limit viral propagation and infection coronaviruses share a large genome around 30 kb express large replicase genes encoding non-structural proteins involving approximately 20 kb of the genome undergo early transcription of the replicase gene contain a viral envelope and utilize ribosomal frameshifting for non-structural gene expression 6 the viral genome is composed of a 5-cap structure with a leader sequence and untranslated region utr composed of multiple stem loop structures needed for rna replication 7 the 3-end contains an utr that has rna structures necessary for viral rna synthesis as well as a 3-polya tail that mimics mrna allowing translation of replicase-encoded non-structural proteins transcriptional regulatory sequences trss are found at the 5-end of most structural and accessory genes with most accessory genes being non-essential but modulating viral pathogenesis 8 there are four main structural proteins termed spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n the s protein is about 150 kd and is responsible for the spike on the viral surface and trimeric s protein is used for viral attachment to cell entry receptors 9 the life cycle of human coronaviruses begins with viral attachment via the s protein to cell entry receptors typically peptidases the sars-cov virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the main cellular receptor with the membrane serine protease tmprss2 acting as an accessory protein to stabilize cell entry and cleavage of the s protein following viral fusion with the cell membrane 10 11 the virus enters and replicates within the cytoplasm starting with translation of the replicase gene and assembly of a viral replicase complex 12 the complex and non-structural genes act to inhibit host cell translation while promoting host mrna degradation and enhancing viral rna synthesis and replication 12 the process results in genomic and subgenomic rna generated via negative-strand intermediates and the s e and m structural proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum er and move into the er-golgi intermediate compartment where viral genomic progeny are encapsidated by the n protein 13 after assembly virions are transported to the cell surface and released by exocytosis in some coronaviruses excess s protein can mediate cell fusion with neighboring cells a process that may allow rapid viral transmission without detection by the host humoral immune response 14 to accelerate pharma rd across targets and disease areas immuneering developed disease cancelling technology dct to identify targets and drugs reversing disease gene expression and fluency a computational platform for large scale high throughput in silico screening dct quantifies similarity of genome-wide signatures of disease to signatures of drug induced gene expression changes using cosine similarity uniquely relative to other methods dct quantifies the per-gene contribution to overall disease amplification or cancellation and is not biased to any specific targets or pathways fluency predicts quantitative binding affinity purely from sequence unlike other methods fluency is a single universal quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar model able to accept any molecule and protein sequence as input when trained on the over 2 million ic50 values from chembl fluency achieves near experimental level binding prediction accuracy as well generating predictions on the binding site we applied these platforms to determine if repurposing of existing drugs may be helpful in covid-19 infection by 1 assessing established drugs for binding to ace2 and tmprss2 two proteins used by the virus to enter cells and 2 scanning fda approved compounds for transcriptomic disease cancellation of coronavirus associated gene expression changes given that the covid-19 virus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the main cellular receptor to enter the cell we ran two fluency models with ace2 as the target input two different fluency models model a and model b were run to predict binding of ace2 to all chemicals in the selleckchem fda approved drug library initial ranking by performance in model a is shown in table 1 which included multiple known ace inhibitors scoring well enalaprilat ramipril lisinopril monopril captopril out of these drugs enalaprilat has the best binding score from model a given reports of the possibility of ace2 induction being driven by ace1 inhibition 15 and multiple subsequent reports hinting at benefit from ace inhibition 1619 we were interested to observe ace2 specificity in comparison to ace1 for top hits the binding of ace2 and ace1 was compared by calculating the difference in predicted binding ace2 binding minus ace1 binding using two fluency models table 1 according to model a brigatinib tirofiban hydrochloride and aleuritic acid are top ranked by pbind and brigatinib is also highest ranked by model a as specific for ace2 over ace1 glutathione was ranked in 7th place by model a for being more specific to ace2 over ace1 next a consensus ranking using the results of both models a and b was used to select top ace2 binders table 2 enalaprilat tirofiban hydrochloride and sotagliflozin showed balanced performance in both models in order to assess specificity fluency was run on top hits in reverse predicting binding of a small molecule to the human proteome by this metric ramipril piperacillin sodium and captopril had high ranking for ace2 table 2 the worst score by far of top hits considered was r-406 to explore other potential covid-19 associated hits we ran both fluency models with tmprss2 as the target on the selleckchem fda approved drug library and ranked hits based on performance in model a ombitasvir elbasvir and capecitabine are the top predicted binding hits for tmprss2 and cefotiam hexetil hydrochloride and bictegravir are top 10 predicted hits by both models table 3 interestingly chloroquine diphosphate was predicted by model b to bind ace2 with a pbind of 78 ranked 290 out of the fda approved drugs for predicted binding and tmprss2 with a pbind of 75 ranked 210 while hydroxychloroquine sulfate was predicted by model b to bind ace2 with a pbind of 79 rank 261 and tmprss2 with a pbind of 722 rank 307 results not shown in order to confirm or deny findings from fluency we applied a disease cancelling technology approach searching for fda approved drugs which reverse coronavirus associated gene expression changes unlike fluency dct was applied in a target and pathway agnostic way capturing the full gene expression change in a data driven way publicly available gene expression data were downloaded from geo gse68820 healthy mice c57bl6nj were infected with ma15 mouse version of sars-cov 20 lung tissue was collected for gene expression analysis a robust differential expression signal was detected between infected and uninfected mice at day 2 fig 1a top differentially expressed genes included irf7 ifnb1 apod ifit3 lgals9 tor3a and usp18 multiple relevant pathways come up as significant adjpval  3e05 when performing gsea-pre-ranked analysis including influenza viral rna transcription and replication lymphocyte network interferon signaling jak stat signaling and graft vs host disease this disease signature was applied to immuneerings disease cancelling technology to identify drugs which could potentially cancel out ma15 associated gene expression out of the 26288 drugs tested glutamine ranked 6th with a dct cancellation score of  00556337 with an adjusted p value  1e05 table 4 genes changing in the opposite direction between ma15 infection and glutamine treatment are plotted in fig 1b interestingly glutamine is a precursor to glutathione which was ranked highly in fluency results table 1 thus two orthogonal approaches neural networks and cosine distance used on two different data types binding prediction and gene expression both arrived at the same potential hit glutamineglutathione first we utilized an unbiased ai-based systems algorithm to interrogate 2657 fda approved or repurposing drugs for binding to ace2 the main sars-cov-2 human cell entry receptor the rapid analysis of repurposing approved drugs for new indications allows for immediate access to potential agents that could be used for urgent emerging diseases such as covid-19 the ability to identify such drugs requires additional biologic validation through in vitro studies confirming receptor blockade and inhibition of sars-cov-2 cell entry and replication and in vivo ideally through randomized controlled clinical trials during a global pandemic however time may not allow for usual drug development processes and repurposing of commonly available drugs may be critical indeed anecdotal reports of hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and anti-il6 therapies have received attention 21 22 while hydroxychloroquine was predicted to bind to ace2 by model b supporting the anecdotal reports we did not detect azithromycin or anti-il-6 agents as these would not be anticipated to mediate therapeutic activity through ace2 modulation further validation will be needed to determine if unbiased ai-based systems approaches are superior to anecdotal observations in the binding prediction analysis multiple known drugs were identified as potential ace2 inhibitors table 1 not surprisingly twelve were ace inhibitors this adds some confirmation that the unbiased selection accurately identified drugs with high likelihood of receptor binding ace inhibitors are agents commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure this family of drugs are based on various peptide compositions and were initially selected for binding to ace1 which catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin i to angiotensin ii thereby blocking the renin-angiotensin system ras lowering systemic blood pressure increasing sodium excretion and increased renal water output ace inhibitors are not known to bind to ace2 which lacks the carboxypeptidase activity of ace1 but does contain a zinc-binding domain exhibits metallopeptidase activity and shares approximately 40 homology with ace1 23 24 our model selected for preferential ace2 binding and agents with better predicted binding values were prioritized see table 1 early studies largely used angiotensin catalysis as the major readout for inhibition and whether current ace inhibitors may block sars-cov-2 binding remains speculative 25 in addition due to the counter regulatory nature of ace1 and ace2 expression it is possible that agents that downregulate ace1 receptors may increase ace2 receptor expression and could worsen coronavirus infection thus we scanned for binding of both ace1 and ace2 for top hits and ranked by predicted difference in binding by this metric captopril enalaprilat and monopril looked likely to inhibit both and potentially solicit this undesired feedback effect table 1 ramipril is a long-acting ace inhibitor prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite ramiprilat in the liver and may be associated with hepatic injury likewise monopril is a pro-drug that undergoes transformation in the liver to the active metabolite fosinoprilat in contrast lisinopril is an orally active ace inhibitor that does not undergo metabolic transformation and is excreted in the urine and does not bind to other serum proteins but may also be associated with hepatic toxicity and these drugs need to be used cautiously in patients with underlying liver disease captopril is a sulfhydryl-containing proline analog with potent and specific activity in blocking ace peptidyl-dipeptidase activity captopril may also have anti-tumor activity through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and promotion of anti-tumor immunity 26 the analysis also identified a drug involved in glucose homeostasis and used in patients with diabetes mellitus as anti-hyperglycemic agents nateglinide table 1 is a derivative of phenylalanine and acts on beta-islet pancreatic cells atp-sensitive potassium channels and stimulates insulin secretion 27 the drug has been used for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus sotaglifozin table 2 is an oral inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter subtype 1 sglt1 expressed in the gastrointestinal gi tract and sglt2 expressed in the kidneys 28 to our knowledge this agent have not been previously known to bind to ace or ace2 glutathione is another interesting agent that was predicted by both binding ai and gene expression disease cancellation it is an antioxidant demonstrating improved airway clearance and pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis 29 glutathione has also been evaluated as an adjunct in patients receiving certain chemotherapy agents following lung transplantation and for management of hiv and parkinsons disease with mixed results 30 fostamatinib r-406 table 2 is an oral inhibitor of the spleen tyrosine kinase syk that is converted to the active metabolite tamatinib and has been approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and is being evaluated in other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis 31 r-406 may also mediate signal transduction downstream of classical immunoreceptors including the b-cell receptor explaining why it may be useful in treating autoimmune diseases and b cell hematologic malignancies 32 emricasan table 2 also called idn-6556 is a thiol protease that acts as a caspase-3 inhibitor that received orphan g status by the us fda for treatment of liver disease such as chronic hepatitis c where it functions to protect against excessive hepatic cell apoptosis emricasan has been shown to decrease hepatic aminotransferases in patients with hepatitis c and other viral-induced and non-viral liver diseases 33 the drug has also shown activity against zika virus-mediated caspase 3 induction and blocked viral infection of neural cells in vitro 34 the potential antiviral activity of emricasan was identified in a drug repurposing screen following the zika virus outbreak in 2016 34 fosamprenavir was identified table 2 and is a protease inhibitor prodrug of amprenavir an anti-retroviral drug approved for the treatment of hiv disease agents with known antiviral activity against rna viruses are especially interesting for evaluation against coronaviruses orlistat table 2 is a carboxyl ester and reversible inhibitor of gi lipases 35 orlistat was initially isolated from streptomyces toxytricini a gram-positive bacterium and blocks hydrolysis and absorption of dietary fats and was approved in the us and uk for the treatment of obesity two of the drugs identified have activity as anticoagulants tirofiban hydrochloride table 1 and argatroban table 2 tirofiban is a non-peptide tyrosine derivative and functions as an antagonist of the purinergic receptor platelet glycoprotein-iibiia 36 the drug inhibits platelet aggregation and has been used for treating acute coronary syndrome and is being studied for management of ischemic stroke 37 in contrast argatroban is a small molecule that directly inhibits thrombin and is used for management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 38 piperacillin table 2 is a broad spectrum semi-synthetic beta-lactam ureidopenicillin antibiotic derived from ampicillin piperacillin is active against gram-negative bacteria and was initially used for treating pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and later as part of combination antibiotics for more complex infectious indications 39 in contrast to macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis piperacillin blocks bacterial wall synthesis since these are commonly used agents in the management of patients with pneumonia they both merit further studies to understand their role in ace2 modulation and potential role in management of covid-19 infection to search for potential covid-19 therapeutic approaches in an orthogonal and unbiased way we applied our disease cancellation technology to gene expression data from an animal model of sars-cov and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals by this gene expression method glutamine was a top hit for reversing coronavirus associated changes in gene expression glutathione was highly ranked by fluency for ace2 binding and its precursor glutamine was highly ranked by gene expression dct suggesting both deserve further testing to explore potential benefits against sars-cov-2 both glutamine and glutathione have previously demonstrated antiviral activity against herpes virus hsv infections 40 in summary we used a novel ai-based systems approach to identify potential drugs currently available that are predicted to bind to ace 2 these agents are readily available and could be rapidly assessed both in the laboratory and clinic for activity against sars-cov-2 infection and clinical course of covid-19 disease further studies of these agents may provide new clinical strategies for patients with coronavirus diseases under normal circumstances we would conduct experimental validation prior to submitting this report for publication given the current public health emergency we are publishing this work now in the event that others are set up to more quickly validate assess and build upon these findings although validation is still needed this report highlights how ai-based systems may be utilized to rapidly identify drugs for repurposing against new and emerging human diseases ace2 uniprot id q9byf1 ace1 uniprot id p12821 and tmprss2 uniprot id o15393 were run separately as the protein target of immuneerings fluency query fluency is a single universal quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar deep learning model which takes protein amino acid sequence and small molecule smiles as input fluency was trained on experimental binding data from chembl 24 model a and chembl 25 model b fluency predictions have previously been experimentally validated for multiple targets in this case fluency was used to predict binding of the selleckchem fda approved drug library httpswwwselleckchemcomscreeningfda-approved-drug-libraryhtml separately to ace2 ace1 and tmprss2 for top hits fluency was run in reverse predicting binding of a single small molecule to 20206 human proteins to score specificity predicted binding scores for ace1 and ace2 were compared for top hits to assess predicted specificity for ace2 over ace1 in each model as reflected in the pbindxace2-pbindxace columns similarity to known binders reported pchembl value greater than 7 in the chembl database to ace2 was computed using tanimoto distance of molecular fingerprints from rdkit in python top ranked fluency hits were filtered by evaluating individual rankings from model a and model b as well as the average rank of predictions and the combined pbind scores of both models gene expression data was downloaded from geo gse68820 the processed data which was background corrected quantile normalized and summarized after outlier removal by the author was used 20 for each of the time points differential expression was calculated between the ma15 sars-cov virus infected wild type mice lung samples and the mock-inoculated wild type mice using the limma r-package version 3406 41 immuneering leveraged its previously described 42 and validated 43 44 dct and ran the sars-cov disease signature against the lincs drug perturbation database 45 results were filtered for adjusted p-value significance and maximal disease cancellation score  integrating logical rules into neural multi-hop reasoning for drug repurposing yushan liu marcel hildebrandt mitchell joblin martin ringsquandl volker tresp  the graph structure of biomedical data differs from those in typical knowledge graph benchmark tasks a particular property of biomedical data is the presence of long-range dependencies which can be captured by patterns described as logical rules we propose a novel method that combines these rules with a neural multi-hop reasoning approach that uses reinforcement learning we conduct an empirical study based on the realworld task of drug repurposing by formulating this task as a link prediction problem we apply our method to the biomedical knowledge graph hetionet and show that our approach outperforms several baseline methods  advancements in low-cost high-throughput sequencing and data acquisition technologies have given rise to a massive proliferation of data describing biological systems biomedical knowledge graphs kgs are becoming increasingly popular as backbones for artificial intelligence tasks such as personalized medicine predictive diagnosis and drug discovery drpinghaus  jacobs 2019  from a machine learning perspective reasoning on biomedical kgs presents new challenges for existing approaches because of the unique structural characteristics of the graphs one challenge arises due to the highly coupled nature of entities in biological systems that leads to many high-degree and densely interlinked entities a second challenge is the requirement of information beyond second-order neighborhoods for reasoning about the relationship between two entities himmelstein et al 2017 so that approaches where long-range interactions are incorporated only via node embeddings e g rescal nickel et al 2011  transe bordes et al 2013  tend to underperform unfortunately approaches that explicitly take the entire multi-hop neighborhoods into account e g graph convolutional models r-gcn schlichtkrull et al 2018  often have diminishing performance beyond two-hop neighborhoods i e more than two convolutional layers furthermore high-degree entities can cause the aggregation operations to smooth out the signals alternatively symbolic reasoning approaches e g rulen meilicke et al 2018  anyburl meilicke et al 2019  learn logical rules and employ them during inference however due to the massive scale and diverse topologies of many real-world kgs combinatorial complexity often prevents the usage of symbolic approaches also logical inference has difficulties handling noise in the data recently path-based reasoning methods have become popular and they present a seemingly ideal balance for combining information over multi-hop neighborhoods we propose a novel neuro-symbolic kg reasoning approach arxiv200705292v1 cs lg 10 jul 2020 figure 2  subgraph of hetionet that illustrates the drug repurposing use case the two paths that connect the chemical compound sorafenib and the disease kidney cancer can be used to predict a direct edge between the two entities that combines path-based approaches with representation learning and logical rules these rules can be either mined from data or obtained from domain experts inspired by existing methods das et al 2018 lin et al 2018 hildebrandt et al 2020a b  we use reinforcement learning to train an agent to conduct policy-guided random walks on a kg we propose a modification by introducing a reward function that allows the agent to leverage background knowledge formalized as metapaths in summary our paper makes the following contributions  we propose a novel neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural multi-hop reasoning based on reinforcement learning with logical rules  we conduct an empirical study of several state-of-theart algorithms applied to a large biomedical kg  we show that our proposed approach outperforms stateof-the-art alternatives on a highly relevant biomedical prediction task drug repurposing as an application of our method we focus on the drug repurposing problem which is characterized by finding new treatment targets for existing drugs by repurposing existing drugs available knowledge about drug-disease-interactions can be leveraged to reduce time and cost for developing new drugs significantly a recent example is the repositioning of the medication remdesivir for the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 we aim at generating candidates for the drug repurposing task with machine learning reasoning methods and formulate the task as a link prediction problem where both compounds and diseases correspond to entities in a kg let e denote the set of entities in a kg and r the set of binary relations elements in e correspond to biomedical entities including e g chemical compounds diseases and genes each entity belongs to a unique type in t  defined by the mapping   e  t  for example  aurkc  gene indicates that the entity aurkc has type gene we define a kg kg  e  r  e as a collection of triples of the form h r t which consists of head relation and tail head and tail entities correspond to nodes in the graph while the relation indicates the type of edge between them for any relation r  r we denote the corresponding inverse relation with r 1 i e h r t is equivalent to t r 1  h triples in kg are interpreted as true known facts for example the triple sorafenib treats liver cancer  kg in figure 2 corresponds to the fact that the kinase inhibitor drug sorafenib is approved for the treatment of liver cancer we further distinguish between two types of paths instance paths and metapaths an instance path of length t  n on kg is given by a sequence constitutes an instance path of length 2 where is the corresponding metapath logical rules eg the commonly used horn clauses are usually written in the form head  body the head can be written out as a triple and the body can be expressed as a metapath define ctd  compound treats disease then a rule with respect to edges of type treats is of the generic form in particular the body of a rule corresponds to a metapath starting at a compound and terminating at a disease the goal is to find instance paths where the corresponding metapaths match the body of a rule to predict a new relation between the source and the target of the instance path the confidence of a rule indicates how often a rule is correct and is defined as the rule support divided by the body support in the data we pose the task of drug repurposing as a link prediction problem based on graph traversal starting at a query entity eg a compound to be repurposed an agent performs a walk on the graph by sequentially transitioning to a neighboring node the decision of which transition to make is determined by a stochastic policy each subsequent transition is added to the current path extending the reasoning chain until a finite number of transitions is reached the general approach is inspired by the reinforcement learning method minerva das et al 2018  with our primary contribution coming from the incorporation of logical rules into the training process the state of the environment consists of the entity e t where the agent is located at time t the source entity e c  and the target entity e d  where e c and e d correspond to the compound that we aim to repurpose and the target disease respectively thus a state s t for time t  n is represented by s t  e t  e c  e d  the agent is given no information about the target disease so that the observed part of the state space is given by e t  e c   e 2  let e  r d denote the embedding of entity e and r  r d the embedding of relation r the set of available actions contains all outgoing edges from the node e t with the corresponding target nodes and the option to stay at the current node with no transition we denote with a t  a st the action that the agent performed at time t the environment evolves deterministically by updating the state according to the previous action the agent encodes previous actions via a multi-layered lstm hochreiter  schmidhuber 1997  where a t1  r t1  e t   r 2d corresponds to the vector space embedding of the previous action or the zero vector at time t  0 the action distribution is given by where w 1 and w 2 are weight matrices and the rows of a t  r a s t 2d contain the latent representations of all admissible actions from s t  an action a t  a st is sampled according to a t  categorical d t   overall t transitions are sampled resulting in a path denoted by where t is the maximum path length equations 1 and 2 induce a stochastic policy represented by   where  denotes the set of all trainable parameters including all entity and relation embeddings furthermore let m  m 1  m 2      m m  be the set of metapaths where each element corresponds to the body of a rule for every metapath m  we assign a score sm   r that indicates a quality measure of the corresponding rule such as the confidence or the support with respect to making a correct prediction for a path p  we denote withp the corresponding metapath during training a terminal reward is computed according to the first term indicates whether the agent has reached the correct target disease the second term checks whether the metapath corresponds to the body of a rule and adds to the score accordingly heuristically speaking we want to reward the agent with a higher score for extracting a metapath that corresponds to a body the hyperparameter   0 balances the two components of the reward for   0 we recover minerva we employ reinforce williams 1992 to maximize the expected rewards thus the agents maximization problem is given by where e c denotes the true underlying distribution of the set of chemical compounds hetionet himmelstein et al 2017 is a biomedical kg that integrates data from 29 highly reputable and cited public databases it consists of 47031 entities with 11 different types and 2250197 edges with 24 different types we aim to predict edges with type treats between entities that correspond to compounds and diseases the goal is to perform candidate ranking according to the likelihood of successful drug repurposing in a novel treatment application there are 1552 compounds and 137 diseases in hetionet with 775 observed links of type treats between compounds and diseases himmelstein et al 2017 compiled a list of 1206 metapaths corresponding to various pharmacological efficacy mechanisms that connect entities of type compound with entities of type disease through hypothesis testing and domain expertise they identified 31 effective metapaths that served as features for a logistic regression model out of these metapaths we select the 10 metapaths as background information that have at most path length 3 and exhibit positive regression coefficients indicating their importance for predicting drug efficacy the metapaths are included as rule bodies in m where the rule head is always compound treats disease we estimate the confidence score for each rule by sampling 10000 paths whose metapaths correspond to the rule body and use the confidence for the score sm  see section 3 table 1 shows the three metapaths with the highest confidences  we apply our method denoted by minerva to hetionet and calculate hits1 hits3 hits10 and the mean reciprocal rank mrr during inference a beam search is carried out and the entities are ranked by the probability of their corresponding paths moreover we consider another evaluation scheme minerva pruned that retrieves and ranks only those paths from the test rollouts that correspond to one of the metapaths all the other extracted paths are not considered in the ranking we compare our approach with the path-based method minerva the rule-based method anyburl and the embedding-based methods transe rescal and r-gcn anyburl only learns one rule for the relation treats that has a length of at least 2 to see the effect of applying a larger number of rules we try a setting where we use the metapaths for the prediction step which leads to significantly improved results transe and r-gcn show similar performance and rescal performs best among the embedding-based methods applying the modified ranking scheme our method yields performance gains of 266 for hits1 197 for hits3 31 for hits10 and 165 for mrr with respect to best performing baseline method our method can act as a generic mechanism to inject domain knowledge into reinforcement learning-based reasoning methods on kgs lin et al 2018 xiong et al 2017  while we employ rules that are extracted in a data-driven fashion our method is agnostic towards the source of background information the additional reward for extracting a rule see equation 3 can be considered as a regularization that enforces the agent to walk along metapaths that generalize to unseen instances anyburl is strictly outperformed by both minerva and our method most likely the large amount of high-degree nodes in hetionet lead to the outcome that hardly any strong predictive rules are extracted multi-hop reasoning methods contain a natural transparency mechanism by providing explicit inference paths surprisingly our experimental findings show that path-based reasoning methods outperform existing black-box methods on the drug repurposing task without a trade-off between explainability and performance both transe and rescal are trained to minimize the reconstruction error in the immediate first-order neighborhood and our results indicate that these methods seem not to be suitable for the drug repurposing task r-gcn is in principle capable of modeling long-term dependencies due to the receptive field containing the entire set of nodes in the multi-hop neighborhood however the aggregation and combination step of r-gcn essentially acts as a lowpass filter on the incoming signals and in the presence of many high-degree nodes the center nodes may receive an uninformative signal that smooths over the neighborhood embeddings to illustrate the applicability of our method consider the compound sorafenib from figure 2  the three highest predictions of our model for new target diseases include hematologic cancer breast cancer and barretts esophagus the database clinicaltrailsgov u s national library of medicine 2000 lists 23 clinical studies for testing the effect of sorafenib on these three diseases showing that the predictions are meaningful targets for further investigation we have proposed a novel neuro-symbolic knowledge graph reasoning approach that leverages path-based reasoning representation learning and logical rules we apply our method to the highly relevant task of drug repurposing and compare our approach with both embedding-based and rulebased methods we achieve better performance and an improvement of 266 for hits1 and 165 for the mean reciprocal rank compared to popular baselines  potential therapeutic targets for combating sars-cov-2 drug repurposing clinical trials and recent advancements abhjieet pandey ajinkya nikam nitin ajjappla shreya basavraj sadhana mutalik p divya gopalan sanjay kulkarni bharath padya singh gasper fernandes srinivas mutalik ruth prassl   in wuhan capital of hubei province china in late december 2019 there were clusters of cases with severe pneumonia due to unknown causes most of the initial cases were identified to have common exposure to the huanan seafood market which was involved in selling dead seafood animals and trading of live animals as china had a quick surveillance system after the sars outbreak the patients respiratory samples were sent to reference labs for etiological examinations assessment of the patients for viral pneumonia was done by testing the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid using polymerase chain reaction whole-genome sequencing and cell culturing chinese government notified the world health organization who and meanwhile closed the huanan seafood market on the 1st of january 2020 the number of cases started increasing drastically since then even to those with no exposure to the seafood market thus indicating human to human transmission 7 the first fatality was reported on 11th january this turned out to be an epidemic initially spreading to other countries like thailand south korea and japan as there was massive chinese migration due to chinese new years eve this virus was identified as -cov on 7th january it had 962 homology to bat coronavirus namely ratg13 genome whereas 795 homology to sars coronavirus the samples taken from the surroundings of the huanan market showed positive results for this virus confirming its origin this cov used the same receptor as of sars-cov ie angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace 2 receptor to infect the humans 8 on 12th january who officially named this cov as 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov later on the 11th february who termed the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and csg coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses changed the virus name officially from 2019-ncov to sars-cov-2 due to a lot of similarities with sars-cov 9 10 11 preliminary finding projected the r0 value basic reproduction number for sars-cov 2 in a range from 14 to 65 12 r0 value represents an average of new infections produced by an infectious person in a total population gives the warning for virus transmission with respect to an epidemic ie if r0  1 the infected number could escalate and if r0  1 the transmission will die out soon the transmission from patients to healthcare workers was seen on 20th january after this wuhan and other cities of hubei province were placed under complete lockdown there were cases of covid-19 in individuals who did not travel to china which further suggested transmission between humans all the domestic and international airports had a screening mechanism in place in order to detect any symptomatic travelers who were kept under quarantine and were allowed to go if they tested negative for the covid-19 test it soon became apparent that the disease could transmit from an asymptomatic person before the commencement of any related symptom all the countries evacuated their respective citizens from wuhan and travelers from china and other affected countries were kept under quarantineisolation for 14 days and went through the covid-19 test on 1st february who declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern cases have continued to exponentially increase since then on 11th march who finally acknowledged covid-19 as a pandemic as of april 16th the total coid-19 cases are almost 2 million worldwide it is to be noted that the number of cases has reduced in china with a drastic increase in countries like the usa with 644 lacs cases spain and italy with almost 18 and 16 lacs cases each most of the affected countries have declared a lockdown with travel restrictions of any kind and border control measure taken to control the pandemic and reduce the transmission mers-cov and sars-cov are considered extremely pathogenic and were transmitted by palm civets or dromedary camels to humans by means of bats the characterization and genomic sequencing of the sars-cov-2 showed that the novel covs was 88 identical to the two earlier reported bat-derived sars-like covs but were different from sars-cov by 79 and mers-cov  by 50 indicating that it evolved from bats but the intermediate source is not yet known the phylogenetic analysis revealed that sars-cov-2 belonged to the genus betacoronavirus and was genetically dissimilar from mers-cov and sars-cov 15 the size of the coronavirus genome varies from approx 26000 to 32000 bases and contains a 6 to 11 number of orfs the first orf that encodes 16 non-structural proteins comprises of approx 67 of the total genome while remaining orf encodes the structural protein and accessory proteins among the four major structural glycoproteins as shown in fig 1
16 spike glycoproteins plays a vital part in binding to the host receptor homology modeling showed that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov enter the lung and utilize the same human cell receptor ie ace-2 despite amino acid variation at key residues while mers-cov enters the host cell via dpp4 17 six mutations arose in the variable sections of the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 but no amino acid replacements were observed in rbd that directly interacts with ace-2 receptors of the host cell 14 receptor affinity analysis claims that the sars-cov strain binds less efficiently than the novel sars-cov-2 strain and further mutation in the nucleotide sequence of rbd may increase its pathogenicity 17 it is uncertain whether higher sars-cov-2 affinity to ace-2 receptor than sars-cov could lead to more severe lung connection this should be further investigated since in vitro studies by inoculating sars-cov-2 in human airway epithelial cells have shown a cytopathic effect with the cessation of cilia movements 18 other than the lung the ace-2 receptors are highly expressed in the small intestine kidney testis and liver hence these organs may also get affected by sars-cov-2 19 with comparison to the current clinical characteristics of covid-19 it does not appear to be different from sars and far less lethal than mers even though it spreads in the community at a rapid pace common symptoms include cough sore throat fever and dyspnoea with at least one symptom in all the infected patients however the chinese centre for disease control reports 81 of cases to have mild indications while 12 was asymptomatic 20 research laboratory results do not vary significantly in patients infected with covid-19 than those diagnosed with other covs infections the most common being lymphopenia together with low platelet amount and lower levels of albumin while the levels of creatine kinase aminotransferases lactic dehydrogenases and c-protein increased 21 patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 and sars-cov had an adverse clinical path with the onset of dyspnoea within 5 days followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome within 30 of the cases within a span of 5 days and need of mechanical ventilation in 17 of the cases due to the abundance of ddp4 receptors in tubules and glomeruli a serious complication for mers appears to be acute kidney injury however it rarely occurs in covid-19 and sars 22 as symptoms commence the viral loads in covid-19 were found to be higher in the nose than in the throat and gradually decrease within days contrary to sars where the maximum shedding is observed after 10 days from onset of indications 2324 through the experiences of the mers and sars epidemics the lessons the world has learned are the finest cultural tools to tackle this novel worldwide danger sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense rna virus with a genome scope of 30 kb consisting of flanking untranslated regions utrs at both 5 and 3 ends the open reading frames orf1a open reading frame and orf1b present at 5 proximal rna genome encodes for a polyprotein which upon proteolytic cleavage results in 16 putative nonstructural proteins nsps such as viral proteases nsp3 cysteine protease and nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp12 helicase nsp13 and other nsps which are expected to be tangled in the viral transcription and replication the distal portion of the viral genome towards 3 end consists of 12 nested orfs which code for the structural proteins namely spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n and other accessory proteins genome analysis has tremendously helped in gaining more insights about the sars cov-2 sequence analysis revealed a major distinction in spike orf3b and orf 8 regions which were previously reported as recombination hotspots 35 several transcriptional regulatory elements such as stem-loop structures present in 5 and 3 utrs and frameshift elements contribute to the complex transcription and translational properties to the viral rna 36 37 38 39 besides understanding about the genetic annotation understanding the sequences in the sub-genomic mrnas and more insight into the secondary structures of the genomic rna would enable in development of genome targeted therapeutics spike protein is a densely glycosylated class i fusion protein on the surface of virus particles it comprises of a large ectodomain a single-pass transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to lipid bilayer and a small intracellular segment the ectodomain has two subunits s1 and s2 both forming homotrimers the c-terminal functional domain of s1 subunit is involved in receptor binding and s2 subunit includes a fusion peptide hr1 and hr2 hepted repeat 1 and 2 a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain that aids in viral envelope fusion with host cell membrane via the endosomal pathway the s protein on the surface of a virus particle is present in a pre-fusion form 40 upon contact with host cell s protein undergo a priming by host cell membrane proteases such as tmprss2 serine protease to induce membrane wrapping and efficient internalization 4142 structural analysis demonstrated that the rbd of sars-cov-2 bound with 10 times advanced affinity to ace-2 than that of sars-cov and in receptor unbound state the s2 domain was more flexible 43 another notable change in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is the presence of the s1s2 furin-like rift spot that is absent in sars-cov several reports suggest that the presence of this proteolytic site increases the pathogenicity of the virus furin like rift spot is also reported to increase the tissue tropism of viruses 4445 so far sars-cov-2 was thought to infect upper respiratory tissue surprisingly a recent report shows the ability of the sars-cov-2 to infect t-lymphocytes also through membrane fusion process 46 spike protein being the first contact site between viruses and cells is subjected to tremendous evolutionary pressure any changes in spike protein would have a profound effect on the infectivity and transmission of viruses in the spike protein of the present pandemic sars-cov-2 changes acquired such as furin-like cleavage site structural changes at the receptor binding sites are being correlated for the species jumping and efficient human-to-human transmission the virus is also found to form syncytium which enables virus spreading by cell-cell fusion which might also leads to the rapid infectivity of the sars-cov-2 virus 47 the main protease mpro also recognized as 3c-like protease is encoded by nsp5 it is the first protein that is auto-cleaved and it further cleaves the polyprotein into individual members of non-structural proteins at the cleavage site leugln ser ala gly it attains a stable active form as an octamer while its monomer and dimer exist in equilibrium 48 sars-cov-2 shares 96 arrangement resemblance with sars-cov the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro showed that polar amino acids in the dimer interface have been replaced with non-polar ones this mutation has resulted in the increased catalytic activity of the dimer while dimer dissociation constants have remained the same 49 protease is essential for virus proteome production and replication therefore mpro is considered as one of the potential targets to treat covid-19 viral replication and transcription of sars cov-2 is carried out by complex protein machinery proteins of this complex are translated from orf1a and orf1b and are the part of large polypeptide chain overall architecture of rdrp complex of sars-cov-2 is found to be analogous to that of sars cov the key constituent of this enzyme complex is rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 it forms the complex with other co-factors such as nsp7 and nsp8 and catalyses the development of viral genomic rna the complex has a central groove where template-directed rna synthesis id catalysed the nascent rna strands exit path is positively charged which bring about electrostatic interaction between nascent rna strand and enzyme complex this exit path is also accessible to the solvents 1050 rna polymerase unit nsp12 is the promising target to develop viral inhibitors and the promising drug remdesivir which has entered into clinical trials now for the treatment of covid-19 also inhibits the activity of rdrp metal ions are an essential part of some viral proteins and play a vital part in their pathogenesis and existence binding of metal ions might activate or inactivate the protein because metal ions can bind to viral proteins different metal ion-conjugates were tested for their inhibitory properties of 3cl protease of sars-cov hg2 zn2 and cu2 exhibited inhibitory properties with zn2 being more effective these metals exhibited non-competitive inhibition 51 many of the putative enzymes coded from the nsp cluster of the sars-cov genome have a zn2 binding domain 52 a detailed molecular interaction study demonstrated that zn2 ions and zn2 ionophores effectively inhibited replicase and also rdrp at the elongation phase 53 helicase is one of the enzymes from the nsp group of proteins in sars-cov it is involved in unwinding the dsrna or dsdna in 5 to 3 polarity the activity of helicase is vital for replication and also the transcription of the viral genome bismuth compounds efficiently inhibited the helicase activity 54 metals being versatile in their utility can be used to minimize the survival of viruses fig 3
 in the current pandemic metal ion based coating to the hospital surfaces and personal protection equipment ppe are being extensively explored however molecular interactions and mechanism of the inhibitory properties of metal ions need to be explored in detail besides targeting viral proteins the cellular mechanisms involved in virus internalization can also be a viable therapeutic strategy fig 3 the entry mechanism and internalization process for sars-cov-2 into cells have not been clarified yet since sars-cov-2 binds to the similar receptor as sars-cov and is also vulnerable to chloroquine a lysosomotropic agent hence there is an increased probability that the sars cov-2 also utilize the similar endocytic mechanism for the entry into the host cells clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most prevalent process of internalization including that of sars-cov therefore drugs such as chlorpromazine inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis are tested for their potential in inhibiting sarscov-2 55 the sars-cov-2 covid-19 host interactions can be modulated by small-molecule agents authorized for other human diseases chloroquine cq a commonly used anti-malarial drug and authorized immune modulator has been recently identified as a possible broad-spectrum antiviral drug 6263 cq is reported to prevent virus infection by elevating the endosomal ph needed for viruscell fusion and by interacting with the glycosylation of sars-cov cell receptors 64 in one of the recent findings cq demonstrates inhibitory activity towards covid-19 ec50  113 m in vero e6 cells 65 and is examined in an open-label trial chictr2000029609 66 subsequently a number of clinical trials chictr2000029542 chictr2000029559 chictr2000029609 chictr2000029740 chictr2000029760 chictr2000029761 chictr2000029762 chictr2000029803 chictr2000029826 chictr2000029837 chictr2000029868 chictr2000029898 chictr2000029899 chictr2000029935 and chictr2000029939 were immediately carried out in china for the safety and efficacy of cq and hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19 linked pneumonia 66 reports have so far shown that chloroquine phosphate is preferred in managing the treatment by constraining the worsening of pneumonia increasing lung imaging tests encouraging virus-negative transformation and reducing the duration of illness 67 cq is an inexpensive and effective drug and has been in use for over 70 years making it potential and clinically beneficial towards covid-19 hydroxychloroquine hcq which demonstrates a highly related structure as shown in fig 4
 and antiviral activity to that of cq may function as a safer treatment method for covid 19 as it demonstrates anti-sars-cov activity in vitro 68 with better clinical safety profile as that of cq during long-term use which will allow high daily dose 69 both compounds can interact with ace-2 glycosylation and decrease the binding capacity between ace-2 on the host cells and the covid-19 surface spike protein they may also raise the ph of lysosomes and endosomes by preventing the virus fusion mechanism with host cells and corresponding replication when hcq enters antigen-presenting cells apcs it inhibits the development of antigen and the autoantigen exposure to t cells controlled by major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii it represses subsequent stimulation of t cells and cd154 expression and other cytokines furthermore hcq disrupts dna  rnas interaction with toll-like receptors tlrs and the cgas nucleic acid detector and thus the expression of pro-inflammatory genes cannot be triggered consequently cq and hcq administration is not only expected to alleviate covid-19s extreme development by preventing its replication and invasion but it also reduces the risk of cytokine storm by blocking t cell stimulation as depicted in fig 5
70 in a more recent study an open-label non-randomized study investigating the impact of hcq eu clinical trial number 2020-000890-25 reported on a group of 36 patients it stated a substantial decrease in nasopharyngeal swab viral positivity relative to control 6 days following inclusion in the hcq group however 16 patients were assigned as controls in a deviation from their chart defined protocol and 6 patients obtained simultaneous azithromycin azm treatment to avoid bacterial superinfection patients who received azm were chosen based on clinical assessment after 6 days the subgroup getting azm had negative virus swabs relative to 57 814 with hcq alone and 125 216 with control 71 it shows that azm added to hcq has been significantly more effective in eliminating the virus however this study is constrained by its low sample size and lack of randomization which gives a lot of room for study with a larger sample size several kinds of research have concentrated on repurposing existing antiviral therapies in particular those that have shown previous effectiveness towards mers-cov and sars-cov authorized protease inhibitors were confirmed to be effective towards sars-cov and mers-cov such as lopinavir lpv and ritonavir rtv clinical trials eg chictr2000029539 are conducted to test hiv protease inhibitors like lpv and rtv in patients with covid-19 infection 66 initially lpv and rtv were suspected to suppress sars and mers 3-chymotrypsin-like protease and proved to be linked with better clinical results of sars patients in a non-randomized open-label study 72 however it is up for debate that lpv and rtv could efficiently block the covid-19 3-chymotrypsin-like and papain-like proteases hiv protease is from the family of aspartic proteases while the two coronavirus proteases belong to the family of cysteine proteases in fact hiv protease inhibitors have been precisely designed to match the c2 structure in the hiv protease dimer catalytic site however this c2-symmetric structure is missing in coronavirus proteases 57 assuming that hiv protease inhibitors modify host pathways to interact with coronavirus infection indirectly their potency remains a matter of concern in the recent study 51 covid-19 patients with conventional chinese medicine interferon lpv rtv and brief-term 3 to 5 days corticosteroids were successfully treated and 50 patients were recovered and discharged 73 a 54-year-old man having covid-19 was successfully treated with lpv and rtv from day 10 of infection 2 tablets lpv 200 mgrtv 50 mg every 12 h was mentioned in a study by lim et al the viral -coronavirus load was begun to decrease after the first day of administration and since then few to no significant coronavirus titers were identified 74 the observation suggest that although there are no drugs for covid-19 at present the repurposing of antiretroviral drug which have been previously approved by united states food and drug administration fda is really helpful in supressing the virus as well as treating already infected individual similar combination of other retroviral agents with appropriate dose and dosing frequency will be quite helpful in facing this situation remdesivir rdv is a broad-spectrum anti-viral and an adenosine triphosphate nucleoside analog it is an investigational small molecule developed by gilad sciences inc in 2015 primarily for the treatment of ebola and it is in phase -ii trials for its activity against the ebola virus-induced hemorrhagic fever 75 in vivo and in vitro animal study data shows that rdv is active against a host of virus-like filoviridae parmyxoviridae and the coronaviridae middle east respiratory syndrome-corona virus mers cov severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 776 the prodrug of rdv gs-443902 constrains the viral rna dependent rna polymerase at the early stage of the viral infectious cycle chain termination and lethal mutagenesis are the other possible mechanisms of action of rdv 77 rdv is an antiviral that is known to reduce the viral load by decreasing viral replication the animal studies showed that the rdv efficiently decrease the viral load in the lung tissue of mers-cov infected mice and further it improved the pathological damage done to the lung tissue and lung function 78 another study showed that the metabolite of rdv gs-5734 was operative against an array of covs like pre-pandemic bat covs bat covs and circulating contemporary human cov in primary human lung cells 79 they also showed that gs-5734 halts the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov and thereby reduces the viral load in primary human epithelial cell cultures rdv blocks sars-cov infection at a micromolecular and at a half cytotoxic concentration 65 there is no sufficient data available on the pharmacokinetics of rdv however the data is extrapolated from in vivo mouse and non-human primate data rdv is metabolized into its prodrug by anabolic intracellular kinase 80 once-daily dosing was found to reach a maximum concentration with a half-life of approximately 20 h in vivo non-human primate model and an in vitro human lung cell model 81 the data relating to protein binding hepatic clearance adverse effects and dosing information is not yet available as per the clinical study data currently a loading dose of 200 mg intravenous rdv is given followed by 100 mg intravenously for 5 to 10 days 82 in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rdv in covid-19 patients several clinical trials have been started a randomized double-blind controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rdv in hospitalized patients with moderate to mild covid-19 respiratory disease has been initiated by china-japan friendship hospital china the trial consists of 08 patients divided into 2 groups with one group receiving active rdv and the other control group receiving rdv placebo the results of the trials are expected to be obtained by the end of april 2020 83 gilead lifesciences has initiated a phase-3 randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of rdv regimens with respect to clinical status by a 7-point ordinal scale on day 14 with 2400 participants the study completion date is expected to be may 2020 84 national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid has initiated a multicenter double-blind randomized adaptive placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of rdv in hospitalized adults diagnosed with covid-19 85 ribavirin rbv is an antiviral purine nucleoside analog approved for chronic hepatitis c virus hcv it is a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug having activity against hepatitis b and respiratory syncytial virus mers-cov sars-cov-2 86 rbv is metabolized by adenosine kinase to its prodrug mono di and triphosphate metabolites the synthesis of viral mrna polymerase is inhibited by the direct binding of rbv triphosphate rtp to the nucleotide-binding site of the enzyme which results in the reduction in the production of defective virions and decreases the viral load 87 rbv also competitively inhibits host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh which further inhibits the guanine nucleotides synthesis the decrease in guanosine triphosphate leads to the depletion of viral protein synthesis and halts the process of viral genome replication 88 rbv also has an immunomodulatory effect on the host by promoting the production of cytokines which stimulates the humoral response and enhances immunity towards the virus the mechanism of action of rbv that includes the inhibition of mrna capping which results in induction of mutation in the viral replication is the main reason for considering rbv as a potential treatment approach to treat sars-cov-2 89 high doses of rbv are required for treatment rbv when given as a monotherapy shows resistance against sars and mers and therefore its given in combination with other antiviral drugs like lopinavir chloroquine analogs and with interferon- 90 a study on vero and llc-mk2 cells showed that the combination of rbv with interferon- inhibits the replication of novel coronavirus ncov isolate hcov-emc2012 in the cell lines with a lower concentration of both rbv and interferon- thus making rbv as a promising treatment for covid-19 90 the pharmacokinetic profile of rbv is well established it is rapidly and extensively absorbed orally with an oral bioavailability of 64 it is metabolized in the liver by adenosine kinase to its mono di and tri phosphate metabolites the half-life of rbv is about 120170 h for the treatment of covid-19 intravenous rbv is given in a dose of 500 mg 23 times daily in combination with lopinavirritonavir or interferon- for not more than 10 days 91 the main adverse effects of rbv are hypocalcemia hemolytic anemia and hypomagnesemia 92 rbv should be avoided in patients with preexisting cardiac disease and in patients with poor renal function rbv is known to cause teratogenic effects and therefore it should be avoided in pregnant women 93 several clinical trials to assess the potency of rbv in treating covid-19 are underway a randomized open labeled controlled phase-2 trial to assess the efficacy of combination therapy of lopinavirritonavir rbv and interferon beta-1b has been initiated by the university of honkong china the aim of the study is to assess the effect of combination therapy in suppressing the viral load shorten the hospitalization time recovery and reduce the mortality in patients with covid-19 infection compared with lopinavir ritonavir 94 arbidol arb or umifenovir is an antiviral drug currently approved in china and russia for the prophylaxis treatment of respiratory viral infections and influenza 95 it is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has demonstrated activity against many other viruses like the lassa virus zika virus ebola virus flavivirus herpes simplex and in food  mouth disease 96 furthermore it has shown activity in vitro against a host of other viruses like hantaan virus chikungunya virus hepatitis b and c virus reovirus and coxsackievirus 97 arb has shown activity against sars-cov-2 virus and thus its been currently investigated for its potential to treat covid-19 prophylactically 95 the broad-spectrum activity of arb is mainly because of its dual action as a host targeting agent hta that acts on one or multiple stages of the viral life cycle and as a direct-acting antiviral daa which induces direct virucidal effects on virus 95 the daa action is mainly because of the ability of the arb to form interactions with amino acid residues arb interferes with intracellular trafficking clathrin-mediated endocytosis and directly with viral lipid envelope 98 the interaction of arb with viral glycoprotein aromatic residues that are involved in fusion and cellular recognition is the main reason for arbs antiviral activity 99 because of its ability to interact with both viral proteins and lipids arb can interfere with the later stages of the viral life cycle 100 the antiviral activity of arb against sars-cov-2 has gained the attention of researchers in the use of arb as a potential treatment therapy alone or in combination therapy to treat covid-19 currently china is conducting various studies to evaluate the potential of arb in treating covid-19 and has recommended the use of arb as a treatment option a study conducted in china reveals that arb effectively inhibits sars-cov-2 infection at low concentration of 1030 m in vitro the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china has included arb in the latest version of the guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia for the tentative treatment of covid-19 arb is rapidly absorbed following its oral administration the maximum concentration of the drug in plasma is estimated to be 415467 ngml and the time taken to reach maximum plasma concentration is between 06518 h 101 it undergoes cytochrome p450 dependent hepatic metabolism and it is also metabolized by intestinal microsomes 102 phase-1 metabolic pathways include hydroxylation sulfoxidation and n-demethylation whereas the phase-2 pathway is mainly due to glucuronide and sulfate conjugation reactions 103 the plasma half-life of arb is 1721 h and it is eliminated majorly through feces currently to treat covd-19 a dose of 200 mg of arb 3 times a day is given orally for not more than 10 days 104 a phase-4 for pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 randomized multicenter open study has been initiated by jieming qu rujin hospital china to observe the safety and efficacy of arb in the treatment of pneumonia induced by sars-cov-2 105 another randomized open study to assess the safety and efficacy of bromhexine hydrochloride tablets given in combination with arb and recombinant human interferon- 2b in the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19 pneumonia has also been initiated 106 favipiravir fpv a derivative of pyrazine carboxamide is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral drug initially developed for influenza several years ago it acts by preventing the influenza viral rna-dependent polymerase rna thus blocking the replication process by acting negatively on genetic copying it has been screened against many rna viruses including h1n1 ebola arena virus and bunyavirus because of its action against rna viruses it was however approved in japan and france and not in other countries for a few indications 107 in order to determine the viability of fpv for covid-19 repurposing we carried out a literature survey of clinical trials using fpv as an investigational drug for different indications results of the research published for a multi-centric phase ii study nct01068912 showed clinical effectiveness of fpv in influenza in low-dose and high-dose treatment modalities with no mortality and no substantial possibility of severe adverse reactions 108 results of the multi-centric phase iii study nct02026349 released on eudract showed that fpv could reduce symptoms and overcome influenza fever without any mortality or significant adverse effect 109 evidently fpv in influenza could contribute to positive treatment interventions fpv may also have possible antiviral activity on sars-cov-2 which is an rna virus a clinical study on fpv for the treatment of covid-19 conducted by the shenzhen third peoples hospital and the clinical medical research centre of the national infectious diseases obtained positive results on 14 february preliminary outcomes from a total of 80 patients along with the experimental group and the control group showed that fpv had a more potent antiviral action than lpv  rtv there were no major adverse reactions in the treatment group fpv and there were slightly less adverse effects than the lpv  rtv group in terms of disease development and viral clearance fpv demonstrated stronger therapeutic responses to covid-19 110 darunavir drv is a second-generation protease inhibitor against hiv-1 scientists in china declared on 4 february 2020 that drv prevented in vitro sars-cov-2 infection cell research demonstrated that drv reported to inhibit viral replication at a concentration of 300 m in vitro and its inhibition efficacy was 280 times that of the untreated group 111 in patients with covid-19 pneumonia drv is used in trial number nct04252274 in combination with cobicistat 112 such a combination is currently approved by the fda in treating aids drv is a hiv protease inhibitor and cobicistat is a supplement to enhance drvs pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics by inhibiting cytochrome p450 cyp3a 113114 the other antiviral drugs are also widely used in covid-19 treatment around the world oseltamivir is another medication licensed for the treatment of influenza a and b it prevents the viral neuraminidase and thereby prevents the releasing of viral particles from host cells thus minimising the spread throughout the respiratory tract 115 usage of oseltamivir with or without antibiotics and corticosteroids is reported in china 116 oseltamivir is also used in clinical trials with chloroquine and fpv in multiple combinations 117 interferons inf are a cluster of cytokines that are secreted by dendritic plasmacytoid and other types of cells 118 these are the bodys natural defense against viral infection and also play an important role in combating tumors and regulating immunity fda has approved infs for the treatment of various conditions like multiple sclerosis hepatitis b and c viral infection hairy cell leukemia and acquired immuno deficiency syndrome aids 119 infs are the first cytokines released during a viral infection the interferon stimulating genes isg which are mainly involved in immunomodulation signaling and inflammation are activated by the inf fixation on interferon  receptor ifnar receptors present on the plasma membrane of most of the cells 120 the isgs activates the adaptive immunity by decreasing the secretion or metabolism of cytokines by interfering with viral replication isgs further prevents membrane fusion by decreasing the membrane fluidity and sensitize the cells to pathogens thereby inhibiting the virus-cell cycle steps 121 inf when given as a monotherapy showed that higher serum concentration of inf is required to halt viral replication whereas the in vitro studies of inf given in combination with ribavirin showed a potent synergistic effect in treating sars 122 the combination of inf and ribavirin at a lower dose showed an inhibitory action on the replication of mers-cov 90 among the subtypes of infs inf1b and inf1a are the most potent inhibitors of sars-cov 123 and mers-cov 124 with respect to coronavirus infection inf1 plays an important role because of its protective role in the lungs it maintains the endothelial barrier function of the lungs by up-regulating cluster of differentiation 73 cd73 in the endothelial cells of lungs and results in the secretion of anti-inflammatory adenosine 125 these studies showed that inf can be used in the prophylactic treatment of covid-19 inf is an investigational drug and hence its complete pharmacokinetic profile is not yet established however the half-life of the pegylated form of inf is 4622 h as of now there is no established dosage regimen for inf in treating covid-19 several clinical trials with inf alone and in combination with other drugs have been initiated an early phase randomized open blank control study has been planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant inf1b as monotherapy in treating corona virus infection 126 in another case an randomized open-label controlled trial on the combination therapy of lopinavir ritonavir ribavirin and inf1b in comparison with monotherapy of lopinavir ritonavir as a treatment for novel coronavirus infection has been planned 94 peginterferon alfa-2a marketed as pegasys has been used in the treartment of chronic hepatitis c in combination with ribavirin with repect to covid-19 several clinical trials with using pegylated interferon alfa have been initiated open label controlled randomised phase ii clinical trial to estimate the antiviral efficacy and safety of pegylated inf lamda nct04343976 and pegylated inf lamda-1a nct04388709 in patients with covid-19 infection have been initiated 127128 azithromycin az is a semi synthetic broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic approved by fda for the treatment of genitourinary tract infections enteric and respiratory tract related infections 129 along with its anti-bacterial activity az has also shown antiviral activity by inducing the production of interferon-stimulated genes in a rhino virus infected bronchial epithelial cells 130 studies showed that az is also effective against zika and ebola virus az acts against the virus by a host of multiple mechanism az inhibits viral genetic shedding from lysosome and blocks endocytosis by getting accumulated intracellularly in the lysosomes and endosomal vesicles leading to the increase in ph levels and thereby limits the replication of viral genetic material 131 the anti-viral activity of az is also attributed to its ability to induce interferon mediated antiviral response which reduces the replication of the virus 132 az also decreases the mucus secretion and enables lung function by directly acting on bronchial epithelial cells 130 az has shown a potential action against sars-cov-2 it interacts among sars-cov-2 spike protein and host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 protein and thereby inhibits the viral entry into the host cell 133 the bioavailability of az following oral administration is 37 it has a high tissue penetration and a longer half life 68 h it is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through biliary excretion the volume of distribution of az is 31 lkg the side effects of az include macrolide antibiotic resistances hearing loss and cardiac arrythmias qt prolongation 129 there are several reports suggesting that a combination of chloroquine and az is effective in reducing the viral load in the treatment of covid-19 usually a dose of 12 g of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is used in the treatment of covid-19 there are around 81 clinical trial registered for testing the efficacy of az in combination with several other drugs for treating covid-19 an open label randomized interventional study has been initiated to compare the efficiency of the two drugs hydroxychloroquine and az to see which one is better in the treatment of confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 134 a multicentre randomized open labelled clinical trial has been started to assess the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab given in combination with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of sars-cov-2 135 a phase ii b double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial has been initiated to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and az to prevent the hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients with covid-19 136 gautret et al conducted a non-randomized observational open-label external control trial on covid-19 patients of 12 yrs age to deduce the efficacy of combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and az 137 they concluded that hydroxychloroquine 500 mgday and az 250 mg day for 5 days successfully reduced the viral load the activity of hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load was further reinforced by az tetracyclines doxycycline tetracyclines minocycline are a class of polyketide antibiotics having a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic activity against various bacterial infections the bactericidal activity of tetracycline is mainly due to its ability to reversibly bind to the bacterial ribosomes and there by leading to the leakage of the intracellular components from the bacterial cell by altering the cytoplasmic membrane 138 several studies have shown that along with anti-bacterial activity tetracyclines also possess a potential antiviral activity against a host of virus including sars-cov-2 tetracycline act by three possible mechanism against sars-cov-2 virus coronavirus depends on matrix metalloproteinases mmps for replication survival cell to cell adhesion and cell infiltration having zinc as a part of mmps complex 139 tetracyclines are known to chelate with the zinc compounds present on the mmps complex and thereby helps in decreasing the severity of covid-19 infection secondly tetracyclines decreases the levels of cytokines and other inflammatory agents by down regulation of nfkb pathways 140 and thereby aiding in the treatment of covid-19 as corona virus causes an elevated release of cytokines il-6 tnf- and il-1 and triggers the release of inflammatory agents like protease and histamine along with cytokines by inducing proliferation of the respiratory submucosa mast cells the third possible mechanism of tetracycline in treating covid-19 is by inhibiting the replication of viral dna in the lungs which is mainly attributed to the high tissue penetrating ability and lipophilic nature of tetracycline the bioavailability of tetracycline upon intramuscular injection is 40 and the oral bioavailability is around 6080 it is a highly protein bound drug with a half-life of 612 h vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite and oral sores are the possible adverse effects of tetracyclines nantes university hospital france has been given approval to start a double blinded randomized placebo controlled multi centred clinical trial the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of doxycycline in reducing abolishing the cytokine storm which is induced by the sars-cov-2 virus in the covid-19 positive patients upon hospitalization 141 teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by the actinomycete actinoplanes teichomyceticus 142 it is currently approved to treat gram-positive bacterial infections like staphylococcal infections 143 teicoplanin has also shown its activity against an array of viruses like the influenza virus hepatitis c virus ebola hiv flavivirus and on corona virus-like sars-cov and mers-cov 144 teicoplanin inhibits the transpeptidase activities and transglycosylation reaction by nonspecifically binding to the outside layers of the peptidoglycan structure followed by binding to the terminal amino acids which constitute the building blocks of the peptidoglycan cell wall 145 thus teicoplanin specifically stops bacterial growth by inhibiting the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall 146 teicoplanin binds to peptidoglycan and inhibits the cell wall lytic enzymes resulting in cell freezing 145 teicoplanin acts against coronavirus by inhibiting the genome viral rna release and thereby preventing the replication of the virus-cell cycle this inhibition activity is because of teicoplanin acting on the early stage of the viral life cycle by inhibiting the low ph cleavage of viral spike protein by cathepsin l in the late endosome 144 in the case of sars-cov-2 teicoplanin acts in the same way by targeting to the cleavage site for cathepsin l present in the spike protein a study to test the efficacy of teicoplanin on 2019-ncov showed that teicoplanin efficiently inhibits the entry of the 2019-ncov spike pseudovirus into the cytoplasm in a dose-dependent manner 147 teicoplanin is poorly absorbed after oral administration it has 90 bioavailability upon administering intramuscularly the protein binding of the drug is 9095 and it is metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation reaction to give metabolites 1 and 2 148 the mean volume of distribution at steady state for teicoplanin was found to be 4070 l it is eliminated by the renal pathway 149 hypersensitivity at the site of injection is the major side effect associated with teicoplanin other than this it may cause bronchospasm and anaphylactic shock teicoplanin can also cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity tachycardia fatigue headache tremors diarrhea and elevation of liver enzymes are the other reported side effects 149 sirolimus is a potent immunosuppressive agent obtained from streptomyces hygroscopicus it is commercially available as rapamune pfizer and is mainly used in treating lymphangioleiomymatosis and as a prophylactic agent to prevent organ transplant rejection the immunosuppressive activity of sirolimus is mainly due to its ability to inhibit t-lymphocyte proliferation activation and cytokine production by selectively blocking the transcriptional activation of cytokines along with possessing antineoplastic and anti-fungal properties it also has anti-viral activity sirolimus binds to immunophilin in the cell to form a immunosuppressive complex and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor kinase which in turn halts the formation of mtorc1 protein complex which is said to play an important role in viral replication studies showed that sirolimus successfully inhibited mtor signalling pathway and there by inhibited mers-cov 150 thus making sirolimus a suitable candidate to further test and use in treating covid-19 the university of cincinnati has been granted approval for performing a double blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trial on the use of sirolimus in treating covd-19 the aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of sirolimus in improving the clinical outcomes among the patients hospitalized for the treatment of covd-19 pneumonia 151 a placebo controlled two-arm double blinded randomized phase-i clinical trial has been initiated to assess the virological efficacy of sirolimus the main of this trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics virological efficacy tolerability and safety of sirolimus as an adjuvant therapy in treating patients with covid-19 152 baricitinib is an immunosuppressant approved by the fda for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis it is a janus kinase jak inhibitor which acts by selectively and reversibly binding to jak receptors there by inhibiting jak1 and jak2 this inhibition leads in halting the signal transduction from growth receptors or cytokines leading to reduction in immune cell function and haematopoiesis baricitinib also prevents the formation of viral particles and intracellular passage of viral cells by binding to associated protein kinase 1 aak1 15 baricitinib is considered as one of the drug candidates to test against covid-19 the patients with covid-19 are prone to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis shl 153 which leads to an elevated inflammatory and ferritin marker levels in the covid-19 patients resulting in hyperinflammation the use of jak inhibitors like baricitinib will aid in reducing the inflammation and it also prevents the viral infection and endocytosis by inducing a inhibitory effect o aak1 receptors 77 the pharmacokinetic profile of the baricitinib is well established the bioavailability of baricitinib upon oral administration is 80 and it reaches a peak plasma concentration within 1 h the half life of baricitinib is 125 h with a volume of distribution of 76 l and its 50 protein binding it is metabolised in liver by oxidation mediated through cyp3a4 and it is eliminated unchanged from the urine 154 the main side effects associated with baricitinib are thrombosis upper respiratory tract infections and malignancy there are several ongoing clinical trials for determining the exact role and the efficacy of baricitinib in the treatment of covid-19 a phase-ii non-randomized open labelled clinical trial has been initiated to investigate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of lopinavirritonavir hydroxychloroquine sulphate and baricitinib in the treatment of moderate to severe covd-19 in hospitalized patients 155 another randomized phase-ii open labelled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of drugs in treating sars-cov-2 associated pneumonia has been initiated the aim of this current study is to design a study design with drugs of different classes and investigate their efficacy in treating covid-19 a combination of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg ritonavir 50 mg baricitinib 4 mg and imatinib 400 mg will be administered to the patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia for 7 days and the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy will be evaluated 156 cyclosporine is a immunosuppressive agent isolated form the fungus beaueria nivea it is widely approved for the treatment of lupus nephritis vasculitis psoriatic arthritis and as a immunosuppressant agent in organ transplantation 157 cyclosporine acts as a calcineurin inhibitor it binds to cyclophilin receptor in the cells and forms a cyclosporine-cyclophilin complex this complex will further block the calcium dependent interleukin il-2 production pathway and suppresses the gene transcription of il-2 thereby reducing the inflammatory responses 158 in the case of covid-19 cyclosporine blocks rna-dependent-rna polymerase and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of sars-cov-2 virus there by inhibiting the cyclophilin function of the virus 159 to enter into the cell corona virus bids to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 at a low cytosolic ph cyclosporine s known to maintain the cytosolic ph at normal levels and there by aids in decreasing the viral load 160 cytokine storm in sars-cov-2 infection is mainly caused due to shl and cyclosporine is the choice of drug to treat shl as cyclosporine blocks the production of il-2 and inhibits the proliferation and survival of t-cells 161 cyclosporine is absorbed variably with a volume of distribution 0f 48 lkg the half-life of cyclosporine is 19 h and its metabolized in intestine and liver by cyp450 enzymes 158 gingival hyperplasia nephrotoxicity and hyperlipidaemia are the possible side effects of cyclosporine despite of its activity against sars-cov-2 virus it is not yet recommended for the treatment of covid-19 as there is no proper pre-clinical and clinical data proving the safety and efficacy of cyclosporine in the treatment of covid-19 available tocilizumab is the first humanized recombinant mab which is used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory conditions like cytokine release syndrome giant cell arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis tcz targets and binds to the membrane bound il-6 receptors thus preventing the interaction of il-6 with il-6 receptors this leads to the reduction of the cytokines pro inflammatory activity resulting in the blockade of antibody production and induction of t-cell proliferation by il-6 162 in the course of covid-19 disease progression the patients develop conditions like acute interstitial pneumonia fever lung injury arthralgia leukopenia thrombocytopenia myocarditis and biological inflammatory changes which is caused due to the hyper production of cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm 163 this cytokine storm is induced by the replication of the virus which activates the innate immune system to produce ils tcz binds to these il receptors and blunts the hyper secretion of ils thereby reducing the inflammation and other related conditions 164 the half-life of tcz is concentration dependent and unlike other mabs tcz is also metabolized to smaller proteins by the action of proteolytic enzymes 165 a dose of 400 mg of intravenous tcz once daily is administered in patients with covid-19 163 skin reactions headaches hypertension and gastrointestinal perforation are the major adverse effects associated with tcz a host of clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the use of tcz in the treatment of covd-19 a multicentred open-labelled phase-ii single arm clinical trial study has been initiated by the national cancer institute naples to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of tcz in treating covid-19 pneumonia 166 another open-label multi-centre clinical trial has been initiated with the main aim to evaluate the use of tcz when given in combination with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in treating the patients hospitalized with covid-19 135 a clinical study design to investigate the use of tcz in manging covid-19 patients with suspected pulmonary hyperinflammation has been initiated it is an open-label randomized multi centred two arm study with the aim to test the hypothesis that tcz can effectively reduce the inflammation caused as a result of virus induced cytokine storm and resulting in the rapid improvement of clinical conditions 167 ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasite drug which is approved for the treatment of onchocerciasis and intestinal strongyloidiasis ivermectin acts by selectively binding to the glutamate-gated chloride on channels of the parasite and leads to hyperpolarization of the cell which results in the paralysis and death of the parasite the anti-viral activity of ivermectin was first discovered with its ability to block the interaction between the nuclear transport receptor importin imp and integrase molecule of hiv 168 it is also known to block the viral replication of host of viruses including influenza flavivirus and dengue virus 169 the in vitro study of ivermectin anti-viral activity against sars-cov-2 virus showed an inhibition of the viral replication up to 5000-fold within 48 h which is mediated by inhibiting the imp  mediated nuclear import of viral proteins 170 a phase-iii double blind randomized clinical trial has been started with a aim to determine the safety and efficacy profile of the combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin i the treatment of hospitalized covd-19 patients 171 ace-2 inhibitors captopril ramipril are widely used in treating hypertension ace-2 receptors are overexpressed on the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa and they are also present immune reactive cells like lungs blood vessels macrophages and intestine 172 in the case of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 ace-2 receptors serves as a door way for the virus to enter into the host cell 173 sars-cov has a transmembrane spike glycoprotein s-protein on its outer shell which binds to the ace-2 receptors once the virus is attached to the ace-2 receptors of the host cell the cellular proteases starts priming the s-protein and allows the virus to get fused into the cellular membrane of the host cell which results in the entry of the virus and replication in the host target cell 41 the amino acid configuration of sars-cov-s protein is almost 80 similar to that of sars-co-2-s-protein and thus shares the same binding affinity to ace-2 receptors as like sars-cov hence sars-cov-2 also utilizes ace-2 receptors as an entry point into the host cell 174 thus treating with ace-2 inhibitors and blocking the entry of sars-cov-2 virus into the cell has been considered as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat covid-19 and in this regard many clinical trials have been initiated in particular corticosteroids are not approved for treating covid-19 or any viral pneumonia 175 in septic shock corticosteroids benefit from blunting the hosts immune reaction to the release of bacterial toxins the frequency of shock is remarkably low in patients with covid-19 5 of cases having to deliver oxygenated blood flow and thoracic pressure from breathing results in increased heart activity leading to cardiogenic shock corticosteroids can cause damage via immunosuppressant activity during the infection treatment and have failed to offer an advantage in many viral epidemics including influenza infection respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection mers and sars 176 with covid-19 early recommendations for treating chronically ill people indicate when to use minimal-dose corticosteroids and when to stop using corticosteroids recommendations rely on the particular clinical condition eg refractory trauma artificially ventilated acute respiratory distress syndrome ards patients however they are based on data identified as weak 177 indeed a study was performed in wuhan china identifying clinical outcomes of patients infected with covid-19 n  201 eighty-four 418 patients acquired ards and 44 524 of those died methylprednisolone therapy reduced the risk of mortality in ards patients 178 a retrospective open-label trial chictr2000029386 is planned to examine clinical progress in patients administered with methylprednisolone iv 66179 in another study zhou et al indicated that in 10 covid-19 patients the brief-term optimum-dose corticosteroid 160 mgday and immunoglobulin 20 g  day substantially decreased lung damage stabilized body temperature c-reactive protein lymphocyte and oxygenation levels 180 however when examining 416 covid-19 patients shang et al observed that corticosteroid treatment and the administration of gamma globulin raised fatalities and considered only effective in patients with low lymphocyte levels 181 the delivery of corticosteroids for covid-19 patients is also uncertain according to the above scientific findings the fda provides access to convalescent plasma cp materials abundant in antibodies obtained from suitable donors who are healed from covid-19 the fda indicates that evaluating its safety and effectiveness by clinical trials is necessary prior to clinically prescribing cp for patients with covid-19 and for the same fda has issued guidelines to investigators and health care providers for investigators seeking to review cp for use in patients with extreme or imminent life-threatening covid-19 the fda has posted details through the use of the single-patient emergency investigational new drug ind application process for particular patients also the fda is closely interacting with investigators to explore the prospect of cooperation on creating a master protocol for the use of cp with the aim of minimizing duplicative attempts 182 cp composition is complex and involve a wide range of components deriving from blood plasma includes a mixture of inorganic salts organic compounds water and over 1000 proteins the others factors identified are albumin immunoglobulins complements coagulation and antithrombotic factors main convalescent plasma components are depicted in fig 6a 183184 additional protective antibodies including immunoglobulin g igg and immunoglobulin m igm are found in plasma in addition to neutralizing antibodies nabs which might show antiviral effect igg and igm are the key isotypes although immunoglobulin a iga can also be important especially for viral mucosal infections non-nabs which bind to the virus but do not affect its ability to replicate could contribute to prophylaxis andor improvement in recovery the humoral immune response targets mainly spike s protein fig 6b 184185 cps anti-inflammatory effects include the autoantibodies network and the regulation of an overactive immune system additionally some antibodies prevent complement cascade ie c3a and c5a and limit immune complex formation fig 6c 184186187 researchers have investigated the effectiveness of cp therapy on 10 severe covid-19 adult patients aged 3478 years the pilot study findings indicate cp treatment could be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for severe covid-19 infections a group from china administered a single 200 ml dose of cp to 10 patients with severe covid-19 with elevated levels of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies clinical symptoms such as cough fever chest pain and shortness of breath substantially improved three days after the injection as per the investigators the patients have had elevated numbers of lymphocytes better liver function and decreased inflammation the researchers also reported that the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the patients either increased or stayed elevated following cp transfusion 188 after the covid-19 outbreak was stated pandemic by the who director-general dr tedros on the 11th of march the world started noticing the alarming levels of the upswing in the covid-19 cases hitherto the patients suffering from covid-19 are receiving symptomatic treatment due to the unavailability of a specific therapy in severe cases the treatment includes support to the functioning of the vital organs 189 the understanding of the whole genome sequence of covid-19 allows the refinement of current technologies in developing the potent and targeted therapeutics 190 though several clinical trials are presently in progress in various parts of the world to meet the vital requirements in developing the effective therapeutics and vaccines who recently launched a global mega-trial called solidarity which emphasizes on the four most assuring therapies the antimalarial medications chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine an antiviral compound remdesivir a combination of two anti-hiv drugs ritonavir and lopinavir and lastly the same combination along with an immune system messenger interferon-beta that can aid in paralyzing the virus 191 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine prevent the entry and transport of the virus by altering the ph of endosomes remdesivir a nucleotide analog likely terminates the rna synthesis leading to the induction of mutagenesis both ritonavir and lopinavir being protease inhibitors block the viral cellular entry where ritonavir inhibits cyt-p450 and prolongs the half-life of lopinavir interferon-beta inhibits viral replication 192 in quest of an effective therapeutic moiety various research institutes and pharma companies are repurposing several antivirals antibiotics and their combinations if the efficacy of these repurposed drugs reveals beneficial outcomes against covid-19 it would be a case of good fortune rather than good preparedness the current strategy for pandemic drugs is to develop or repurpose a drug right after the discovery of a novel outbreak several aspects of the pandemic seem to have shown good progress using this strategy within weeks viral genome sequences were understood and published which helped in identifying the suitable drug candidates clinical trials of interferons ace inhibitors remdesivir hydroxychloroquine and monoclonal antibodies are under progress 193  though the window of the usefulness of steroids for covid-19 patients is narrower they are still preferred because of their capability of preventing lung fibrosis and stopping cytokine storm 194 testing of the proposed drugs takes more time particularly when it is performed on humans as a part of clinical trials on the other hand the development of vaccines is hard and takes relatively more time than repurposing an existing drug especially when the novel technologies available have not been tested for safety in the pipeline of vaccines an mrna-based vaccine developed by modera and vaccine research center at nih expresses target antigen after being injected in the form of lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mrna it has reached a phase i clinical trial nct04283461 curevac is currently in the preclinical phase working on a similar vaccine additional strategies which are still in the preclinical phase include s protein-focused vaccines such as viral-vector based vaccines geovax cansino biologics vaxart and the university of oxford recombinant-protein based vaccines novavax university of queensland and biopharmaceuticals dna vaccines applied dna sciences and inovio inactivated virus vaccines and live attenuated vaccines serum institute of india with codagenix johnson  johnson is working on an experimental adenovirus vector that is not yet a licensed vaccine 195 biontech se in collaboration with pfizer very recently april 29 2020 started recruiting humans to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rna vaccine candidates through phase i and ii of clinical trials nct04368728 to combat this pandemic covid-19 vaccines might enter the market lately but will be useful in the ultimate eradication of the virus in table 2
 we have exemplarily summarized the various therapeutics for covid-19 which are under clinical trials considerable progress was made in the in vitro diagnostic test ivd for covid-19 real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is the basic ideology for ivd which takes a few hours for the results few industries have managed to reduce the test time from 3 h cepheid to 5 min abbot a wide array of serology immunoassays ias that primarily detect igm and igg were also developed automated chemiluminescence ia manual elisa rapid lateral flow ia complementing the covid-19 diagnostic molecular assays 196 the production of sars-cov-2 antiviral drugs remains problematic as there are no officially approved drugs and vaccines for the treatment of covid-19 hence we must rely solely on implementing preventive and stringent control measures to reduce the possibility of potential transmission of diseases furthermore the currently limited knowledge for therapeutic drugs must be used thoroughly to establish strategies for drug application to inhibit and manage sars-cov-2 transmission while research is underway to improve covid-19 prevention treatment and control the reported clinical data on various therapeutic approaches are limited several preclinical trials show that s protein is a key viral antigen for vaccine development detailed clinical trials for already licensed products are being performed on covid-19 affected patients since they have a well-established safety profile studies performed in vitro for an antiviral and antimalarial drug namely remdesivir and chloroquine have shown promising results in suppressing the virus in a recent study dated 9th april 2020 1061 patients were treated for covid-19 using a combination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin hzq-az for 3 days and a follow up of 9 days the results depict that 917 of the patients were cured while 43 required intensive care units and 047 of patients died the authors reported that hzq-az combination is a safe and effective treatment if begun immediately after diagnosis and in most cases clears up the virus persistence and contiguity 197 in the future research must be carried out using an effective animal model that analyses the viruss replication transmission and pathogenesis also integrating the imaging and molecular diagnosis will help to efficiently track and treat covid-19 19198199 with the rapid increase in covid-19 cases through out the world the research for development of drugs and vaccines have gained a momentum during this prevailing condition of pandemic the fast development of vaccines is required but it will take time as ongoing clinical trials are necessary for assessing the biocompatibility and toxicity of developed vaccines drug repurposing has proved to be the most efficient approach towards the treatment of covid-19 drugs from various therapeutic category alone or in combination have been explored and many combinations specially antivirals have proved to be effective against the disease although the dose and combination of repurposed drugs has been selected on trial basis and clinical trials on many repurposed drugs have been called off sighting toxicity and efficacy issues the concept of drug repurposing is quite useful and may have demonstrated effectiveness but this might vary with the severity as well as with subjects on which treatment is being done in case of vaccines multiple vaccines have demonstrated positive results and will be goining to next phase soon giving hope for early commercial launch of vaccines against covid-19 amongst alternative therapeutic strategy indian council of medical research recently approved clinical trial for use of herbal formulation against covid-19 while plasma therapy has demonstrated significant results and may be explored more in near future with the ongoing pace of research being conducted in this area the world will be able to tackle this pandemic and life could be normal like before very soon the authors report no conflict of interest  prediction of the sars-cov-2 2019-ncov 3c-like protease 3cl

1 the world health organisation has declared this a global public health emergency  on 15 february 2020 there are more than 65000 confirmed cases reported and the death toll is over 1500 in the height of the crisis this virus is spreading at a rate and scale far worse than previous coronaviral epidemics  it was immediately evident from its genome that the coronavirus is evolutionarily related 80 identity to the beta-coronavirus implicated in the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which originated in bats and was causative of a global outbreak in 2003 the momentum of research on developing antiviral agents against the sars-cov carried on after the epidemic subsided despite this no sars treatment has yet come to fruition however knowledge acquired from the extensive research and development efforts may be of use to inform the current therapeutic options   the viral genome encodes more than 20 proteins among which are two proteases pl
pro and 3cl
pro that are vital to virus replication they cleave the two translated polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab into individual functional components the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3cl
pro aka main protease m
pro is considered to be a promising drug target tremendous effort has been spent on studying this protein in order to identify therapeutics against the sars-cov in particular and other pathogenic coronaviruses eg mers-cov the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus in general because they share similar active sites and enzymatic mechanisms the purpose of this study is to build a molecular model of the 3cl
pro of the sars-cov-2 and to carry out virtual screening to identify readily usable therapeutics it was not our intention however to comment on other structure-based drug design research as these will not be timely for the current epidemic the translated polyprotein pp1ab sequence was obtained from the annotation of the genbank entry of the sars-cov-2 genome accession number
mn908947 by comparing this sequence with the sars-cov pp1ab sequence accession number

-1 
table 3 this presumably demonstrates the intrinsic conformational variability between the a- and b-chain active sites in the crystal structure the average root-mean-square deviation rmsd in c atomic positions of active-site residues is 083  in each screen the differences in binding energies are small suggesting that the ranking is not discriminatory and all top scorers should be examined we combined the two screens and found 16 candidates which give promising binding models etoposide and its phosphate counted as one 
table 3 we checked the actions targets and side effects of the 16 candidates among these we first noticed velpatasvir 
figure 1a d and ledipasvir which are inhibitors of the ns5a protein of the hepatitis c virus hcv both are marketed as approved drugs in combination with sofosbuvir which is a prodrug nucleotide analogue inhibitor of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp or ns5b interestingly sofosbuvir has recently been proposed as an antiviral for the sars-cov-2 based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the hcv and the coronaviruses
14 our results further strengthen that these dual-component hcv drugs epclusa velpatasvirsofosbuvir and harvoni ledipasvirsofosbuvir may be attractive candidates to repurpose because they may inhibit two coronaviral enzymes a drug that can target two viral proteins substantially reduces the ability of the virus to develop resistance these direct-acting antiviral drugs are also associated with very minimal side effects and are conveniently orally administered 
table 4  the flavonoid glycosides diosmin 
figure 1b and hesperidin 
figure 1e obtained from citrus fruits fit very well into and block the substrate binding site yet these compounds cause mild adverse reactions 
table 4 hesperidin hits showed up multiple times suggesting it has many modes of binding 
figure 1a teniposide and etoposide and its phosphate are chemically related and turned up in multiple hits with good binding models 
figure 1f however these chemotherapy drugs have a lot of strong side effects and need intravenous administration 
table 4 the approved drug venetoclax 
figure 1c and investigational drugs mk-3207 and r428 scored well in both screens venetoclax is another chemotherapy drug that is burdened by side effects including upper respiratory tract infection 
table 4 not much has been disclosed about mk-3207 and r428 we subjected the crystal structure to the same virtual screening procedures a very similar list of candidates showed up consistently 
extended data
7 table s2 with high scores although ledipasvir was not found we noticed that most of the compounds on the list have molecular weights mw over 500 except lumacaftor mw452 the largest one is ledipasvir mw889 this is because the size of the peptide substrate and the deeply buried protease active site demand a large molecule that has many rotatable dynamics to fit into it we identified five trials on
clinicaltrialsgov involving antiviral and immunomodulatory drug treatments for sars 
table 5 all without reported results ie at present there are no safe and effective drug candidates against sars-cov this is because once the epidemic is over there are no patients to recruit for clinical trials only the study with streptokinase succeeded in completion of phase 3 it is disappointing that little progress in sars drug development has been made in the past 17 years after the 2003 outbreak numerous inhibitors for the 3cl
pro enzyme have been proposed
16
17 yet no new drug candidates have succeeded to enter the clinical phase 1 one record which receives a lot of attention amid the current outbreak is the lopinavirritonavir combination
18 they are protease inhibitors originally developed against hiv during the 2003 sars outbreak despite lacking a clinical trial they were tried as an emergency measure and found to offer improved clinical outcome
18 however some scientists did express scepticism
19 by analogy these compounds were speculated to act on sars-cov 3cl
pro specifically but there is as yet no crystal structure to support that although docking studies were carried out to propose various binding modes
20
23 the ic
50 value of lopinavir is 50 m 
k
i  14 m and that for ritonavir cannot be established
24 although this is far from a cure based on our results that the two cov 3cl
pro enzymes are identical as far as protein sequences and substrate specificities are concerned we are of the opinion that this is still one of the recommended routes for immediate treatment at the time of writing early february 2020  if we look beyond the 3cl
pro an earlier screen produced 27 candidates that could be repurposed against both sars-cov and mers-cov
25 in addition the other coronaviral proteins could be targeted for screening treatment of the covid-19 with remdesivir a repurposed drug in development targeting the rdrp showing improved clinical outcome has just been reported and clinical trial is now underway
26 we consider this work part of the global efforts responding in a timely fashion to fight this deadly communicable disease we are aware that there are similar modelling screening and repurposing exercises targeting 3cl

jaschinski stefan lhachimi k   since its discovery in 1976 the ebola virus has been the pathogen responsible for an increasing number of epidemics1 the most widespread epidemic took place in western africa between december 2013 and june 2016 and resulted in a total of 28652 reported cases and 11325 reported deaths as of april 20162 the world health organization declared the recent epidemic a public health emergency of international concern and called for intensified efforts to develop therapeutic agents targeting the ebola virus3 although the large-scale epidemic may have ended the emergence of sporadic new cases continues to pose a risk for future outbreaks4 ebola virus disease evd is often considered a disease of poverty because it takes place in the form of sudden outbreaks amongst poor populations and under limited resources5 as with many other diseases of poverty research and drug development for evd have been neglected for many years because it is commercially unattractive for drug developers to invest significant resources for example a study from 2002 revealed that in the period between 1975 and 1999 only 13 out of 1393 new approved drugs were specifically indicated for tropical diseases accounting for 1 of all new approved drugs6 nonetheless the recent evd outbreak led to accelerated de novo drug development efforts for evd7 these efforts were promoted by an expedited approval process by regulators such as the us food and drug administration fda and the european medicines agency8 9 yet after more than 2 years since the start of the epidemic results of many experimental drugs are considered either questionable or negative with only 1 potential vaccine being considered a true breakthrough10 to date none of the experimental drugs has been fully approved for the treatment or prevention of evd due to the urgent need for an effective and accessible evd treatment there were additional efforts to study approved and established drugs as potential anti-evd therapeutic agents a concept known as drug repurposing or drug repositioning11 this concept may have significant advantages in the case of evd which overcomes the limitations of experimental drug development first repurposed drugs usually have well-known safety and pharmacokinetic profiles which leads to shorter development cycles and lower costs12 in addition these drugs may often tap into an already established manufacturing and distribution network which shortens production and delivery times in cases of rapidly spreading epidemics finally depending on which repurposed drugs are being identified they may already be marketed as generics which is a clear advantage in countries with resource-poor health care systems a variety of literature reviews have been published on potential therapeutic targets for evd some of which also include an overview of possible candidates for drug repurposing13 14 15 16 17 18 however no systematic review dedicated to repurposed therapeutic agents targeting evd exists to date herein we present a systematic review with the aim of identifying potential drug repurposing candidates and assessing the scientific evidence available on their efficacy we undertook a systematic review based on an a priori protocol that was registered with prospero crd42015024349 and published in a peer-reviewed journal19 this systematic review was reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma statement20 study designs included drug library screening studies yielding at least 1 approved therapeutic agent including high throughput screening studies or virtual in silico drug screens preclinical trials including in vitro trials and studies on animal models clinical trials including randomized controlled trials controlled clinical trials prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies and casecontrol studies and cross-sectional studies case series and case reports potential repurposed drugs selected for further assessment must fulfill the following criteria drugs that are already approved by at least 1 regulatory authority us food and drug administration fda european medicines agency ema japan pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency pmda and drugs with positive in vitro study outcomes and at least 1 additional animal or clinical trial there were no restrictions on the type of participants in preclinical or clinical trials in addition there were no restrictions on the type of setting we included studies published from 1976 the year of discovery of evd there were no restrictions on the type of comparator the primary outcomes included mortality sequelae of the infection and serious adverse events secondary outcomes include adverse events outcomes were collected as reported we extracted outcomes in all data forms eg dichotomous and continuous as reported in the included studies we included articles reported in the english german french and spanish languages we included articles published in scientific journals as well as unpublished ones literature search strategies were developed using medical subject headings and text words related to evd we performed a systematic literature search in medline embase and cochrane central register of controlled trials the search was carried out on january 2 2017 for studies published between january 1 1976 and the date the searches were run to identify ongoing and unpublished studies we searched the world health organization international clinical trials registry platform clinicaltrialsgov and european union clinical trials register in addition we searched the reference lists of selected studies as well as the websites of regulatory authorities fda and european medicines agency we developed a search strategy with the help of an information specialist supplementary file 1 the database records yielded by all search strategies were exported into endnote version x75 clarivate analytics usa and duplicates were manually removed the results of our database searches and records identified from other sources were documented and depicted in a prisma flow diagram before formal screening a preliminary study screen was used by 2 authors hs and oe to carry out a pilot screening of 50 randomly chosen studies from the search results spreadsheet following the pilot screening both authors independently screened the titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria in addition they screened the reference lists of all selected articles studies selected at title and abstract levels were further screened for eligibility by assessing the full text of the article we retrieved additional information from study authors where necessary to resolve questions about eligibility opinion of a third reviewer skl was sought to arrive at a consensus in case of disagreement on a study for inclusion we documented the reasons for excluding trials at the full-text screening level neither of the review authors was blinded to the journal titles or to the study authors or institutions we reported the results of the study selection process and reasons for exclusion at the full-text screening level using a prisma flow diagram a preliminary data extraction spreadsheet was used to conduct a pilot test carried out by both authors using 5 randomly selected articles the data extraction sheet was refined accordingly after the pilot studies the refined spread sheet was then used by both authors to independently extract data items from all included screening preclinical and clinical studies opinion of a third reviewer skl was sought to arrive at a consensus in case of disagreement study authors were contacted for further clarification if necessary if a selected study included items from more than 1 study type we extracted all eligible items available qualitative data reported in studies was excluded from the review and thus was not extracted however if an included study drew conclusions based on qualitative data we reported those conclusions separately in the characteristics of study table following study selection and data extraction 2 authors hs and oe independently selected drugs with potentially promising results based on the aforementioned drug selection criteria the opinion of a third reviewer skl was sought to arrive to a consensus in case of disagreement on a drug for inclusion two authors oe and hs independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies the risk of bias of in vitro studies and screen studies were not assessed due to the nonexistence of an appropriate risk of bias tool for such studies internal validity of preclinical studies animal studies was assessed using the systematic review centre for laboratory animal experimentation risk of bias tool21 per the instructions outlined in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions the newcastle ottawa scale was used to assess risk of bias of nonrandomized studies the national heart lung and blood institutes quality assessment tool for case series was used to assess the quality of reporting of case reports and case series due to the lack of a suitable risk of bias tool for such studies22 overall risk of bias was judged as low risk unclear risk and high risk whereas the overall quality of reporting was judged as good fair or poor after comparing the individual assessments by oe and hs we initially intended to conduct a quantitative analysis of primary and secondary outcomes in accordance with our protocol for systematic review19 however due to the lack of an adequate number of sufficiently homogenous studies we synthesized the study results narratively our search results are presented in a prisma flow diagram figure 1 our search yielded 4455 records of which 3301 remained after the removal of duplicates following screening at title and abstract level 44 studies were still included after reviewing the full text of these studies against our inclusion criteria 37 studies were selected no additional studies were identified following reference searches no additional or ongoing studies were selected from international clinical trials registry platform clinicaltrialsgov european union clinical trials register or the websites of regulatory authorities we summarized the main characteristics of selected drug screening studies and listed all positively testing drugs with confirmed regulatory approval supplementary file 2 these studies were a heterogeneous group that included 8 high-throughput screens and 3 virtual drug screens six of these studies introduced new drug screening methodologies and carried out pilot screens in addition different studies used varying methods to detect positively testing drugs the most commonly applied technique was the measurement of luciferase activity in infected cells a technique used in 3 studies23 28 31 other applied techniques included measurement of the inhibition of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression and inhibition of beta-lactamase activity in addition to the conduction of drug library screens 3 studies included additional preclinical trials in vitro and in vivo on selected drug candidates24 25 27 relevant items from these trials were extracted and analyzed together with the results from other preclinical studies we summarized the main characteristics of preclinical studies examining the effects of potential drug candidates on evd table i in addition to the data from the 17 preclinical studies selected we also included relevant data from 3 drug screening studies24 25 27 which included in vitro and in vivo trials in vitro trials were carried out on varying cell lines the half maximal inhibitory concentration or the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of tested drugs was extracted if unavailable we reported the half maximal inhibitory concentration or ec50 values from the world health organization categorization and prioritization table60 a total of 14 studies included experiments on animals26 27 29 39 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 three of these trials were carried out on monkey species39 44 50 such as the rhesus macaques whilst the remaining 11 studies where carried on small animal models such as mice hamsters or guinea pigs we summarized the main characteristics of the 9 clinical studies selected table ii these include 3 case reports52 53 54 1 case series55 and 5 nonrandomized cohort studies51 56 57 58 59 convalescent blood products were included in the treatment regimen in a total of 6 studies52 53 54 55 57 59 finally the only end point extracted was the mortality rate because it was the only adequately documented end point shared by all studies from a total of 36 selected studies 14 animal studies26 27 29 39 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 and 9 clinical studies51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 were assessed for risk of bias within studies supplementary file 3 all of the animal studies were found to have a high risk of bias except 1 study with an unclear risk of bias the high risk of bias in the animal studies was mainly due to selection bias performance bias and detection bias the animal studies failed to mitigate selection bias because the test animals were selected without a proper randomization process and thus the samples obtained were not representative of the population intended to be analyzed the animal studies also failed to mitigate performance bias and detection bias by not blinding the investigators the clinical studies were single case reports or case series 4 studies52 53 54 55 and nonrandomized cohort studies 5 studies51 56 57 58 59 of the 4 case studies 2 studies52 53 were judged to have poor reporting quality 1 study55 was judged to have fair reporting quality and the last study54 had good reporting quality all the nonrandomized cohort studies51 56 57 58 59 were found to have a low risk of bias due to the significant variation of selected study types designs participants and reported outcome measures we chose to carry out a narrative synthesis of results rather than a meta-analysis based on our eligibility criteria we selected a total of 11 potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of evd for further analysis we summarized the data extracted on each potential drug table iii chloroquine is a readily available well-tolerated antimalarial agent with a long history of use in the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria it also has well documented antiviral effects at various stages of a viral life cycle including anti-hiv-1 activity61 as well as inhibitory effects on the severe acute respiratory virus syndrome coronavirus62 in addition studies show systemic anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine by downregulating the production of proinflammatory factors such as interferon ifn- and tumor necrosis factor-63 the potential activity of chloroquine on the ebola virus may be achieved by inhibiting virus entry into host cells this is believed to take place by inhibiting various factors such as vesicle sorting and endosome-membrane fusion as well as increasing endosomal ph27 chloroquine was shown to successfully inhibit the ebola virus in vitro in different studies and with various cell lines27 36 39 46 animal studies on the other hand revealed mixed results in 2013 madrid et al27 carried out an animal trial in which 8 out of 10 mice survived ebola infection when treated with chloroquine twice daily at 90 mgkg ip in another study intraperitoneal treatment with chloroquine at the same dose showed no significant protection and high toxicity in a mouse and hamster model46 in 2015 madrid et al48 were able to reproduce positive results upon repeat testing of chloroquine on ebola-infected mice under identical conditions 90 mgkg ip twice daily chloroquine administered orally at 40 mgkg once daily showed no increase in survival48 our search did not yield any clinical trials for chloroquine the mixed results provided by animal studies may be explained by the range of doses tested with an ec50 of 16 m higher doses may be necessary to produce consistently positive results this may lead to poor outcome due to an increase in drug related toxicity furthermore chloroquine may be more effective if given prophylactically due to its activity during the early stages of a viral cycle hence additional animal studies for dose finding are recommendable before clinical trials amodiaquine is an antimalarial agent structurally related to chloroquine and widely used in africa in 1 in vitro study27 amodiaquine was shown to inhibit the ebola virus as well the marburg virus more potently than chloroquine as demonstrated with lower ec50 values however in the only animal study yielded by our search mice treated with 60 mgkg ip amodiaquine twice daily for 7 days showed no survival benefit46 in a retrospective observational study of patients with evd a switch from an antimalarial containing lumefantrine to amodiaquine was associated with a significant decrease in case fatality rates at mdecins sans frontires-led evd treatment units56 it remains unknown whether the improved survival rate was due to the antiviral activity of amodiaquine or possible toxicity of lumefantrine another limitation of this study was unmeasured patient characteristics ie confounding variables that could have influenced the mortality rate toremiphene and clomiphene are well-established selective estrogen reuptake modulators approved for the treatment of breast cancer and infertility respectively both drugs were able to inhibit ebola virus entry in vitro by more than 90 this was likely the result of late-stage entry inhibition that affects the triggering of fusion27 in a mouse model 9 out of 10 animals treated with 60 mgkg ip clomiphene survived a lethal dose of ebola virus for the toremiphene treatment group 5 out of 10 mice treated with the drug 60 mgkg survived two control groups showed 0 survival rates27 in another animal study mice treated with 60 mgkg ip clomiphene twice daily showed no survival benefit compared with a control group48 additional animal trials at different doses are essential to confirm the survival benefit association with these drugs there are certain concerns that limit the practicality of use of toremiphene and clomiphene as evd therapeutic agents higher doses than the standard clinical range may be necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect on evd which would increase the risk of serious side effects these include ocular adverse effects for clomiphene and serious electrolyte derangements for toremiphene these drugs may therefore be better suited as candidates for combination treatments ifns are signaling proteins that are produced and secreted by host cells in response to pathogens or tumor cells they are currently approved for the treatment of hepatitis c64 as well as certain autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis65 during recent viral outbreaks ifns have been suggested as a potential treatment for emerging viral infections such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus66 the antiviral activity of ifns appears to occur via the induction of ifns-induced transmembrane proteins which inhibit a broad range of viruses at different stages of the virus life cycle including viral entry and fusion67 68 the potential use of ifns in the treatment of evd has been assessed by several studies since the 1990s34 41 45 47 in vitro studies have shown potent inhibition of evd across multiple cell types in 1 animal study ifn- was shown to protect mice challenged with a lethal dose of ebola virus45 two additional studies involving nonhuman primates treated with ifn- or ifn-2b revealed an increase in survival time but no change in mortality41 45 despite a potential increase in the availability of ifns as therapeutic agents69 there are several concerns on the practicality of its use during an evd outbreak certain side effects of ifn such as fever and myalgia may be difficult to control in an evd treatment unit in addition it is important to rule out comorbidity with malaria before an interferon treatment which may be difficult to achieve and may further delay treatment the transfusion of blood products is an established treatment method for a variety of noninfectious conditions in the case of infectious diseases there are several reports on the off-label use of convalescent blood products70 71 we chose to include convalescent blood products in our assessment due to the similar properties shared with repurposed therapeutics these include their presumed availability in the setting of an evd epidemic positive reports on tolerability and the absence of safety-related events in 2 nonrandomized studies57 59 nonetheless it is important to note that transfusion-transmitted infections remain a significant problem in africa and it may be difficult to distinguish between transfusion-related complications and evd progression72 73 the use of whole blood as a form of passive immunotherapy for the treatment of evd was reported during the evd outbreak in the democratic republic of congo in 199555 in the observational study 7 out of 8 patients who received convalescent blood transfusion survived in contrast to an 80 mortality rate during that outbreak however all 7 survivors received convalescent blood between day 7 and day 15 after the onset of symptoms in a separate analysis it was shown that the high rate of survival was due to the treatment of patients later in the course of disease when they have a higher probability of survival74 during the recent west africa evd outbreak the world health organization approved the use of blood or plasma transfusions from convalescent patients75 our search yielded 3 single case reports of foreign patients who contracted evd during their stay in western africa and survived following transfusion therapy52 53 54 an additional potential therapeutic agent was administered in 2 cases52 54 the largest study on the treatment of evd with convalescent blood enrolled 102 confirmed evd patients in a mdecins sans frontires-led treatment unit in guinea of whom 84 were included in the primary analysis57 the study showed no significant improvement in survival for patients receiving up to 500 ml convalescent plasma with unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies even after adjusting for age and cycle-threshold value a recently published study from sierra leone59 similarly did not show a significant improvement in survival but revealed a significant drop in viral load after 24 hours of treatment with convalescent whole blood furthermore results from a recent animal study by mire et al50 did not show protection by the treatment of rhesus monkeys with convalescent sera it remains unknown whether convalescent blood products with known titers of anti-ebola virus antibodies alternative administration regimens or a subselection of patients would yield different results amiodarone is a widely available commonly used multi-ion channel blocker approved for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardic arrhythmias it has been identified as a potent inhibitor of the ebola virus in various endothelial and epithelial cell lines at concentrations that are commonly reached in humans treated with this drug35 38 its mechanism of action appears to rely on the induction of a niemann-pick c-like phenotype that inhibits late endosomal filovirus entry76 in the only small animal study yielded by our search treatment with 90 mgkg amiodarone ip twice daily significantly improved the survival of ebola virus-challenged mice a repeat trial under identical conditions was unable to reproduce the significant improvement in survival rates48 furthermore amiodarone was reportedly used in sierra leone to treat evd patients in 1 treatment unit on a compassionate basis but the potential effects and their statistical significance could not be determined77 other therapeutic agents that appear to inhibit filovirus entry in a similar fashion to amiodarone are sertraline and bepridil sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used in the treatment of depression bepridil is a calcium channel blocker once used to treat angina pectoris both drugs were found to effectively inhibit ebola virus in vitro by more than 9025 in a murine model 7 out of 10 mice treated with 10 mgkg sertraline twice daily survived compared with 100 mortality in the control group in the same study 10 out of 10 mice treated with 12 mgkg bepridil survived25 favipiravir is a relatively new viral rna polymerase inhibitor approved in 2014 by japan pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency for the treatment of influenza a virus infections it is considered to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against rna viruses and has demonstrated activity against hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses such as the arenaviruses and bunyaviruses78 79 to unfold its antiviral activity favipiravir is initially converted to its active metabolite which acts as an rna polymerase inhibitor mainly via direct competition with guanosine-5-triphosphate gtp in addition favipiravir causes lethal mutagenesis after being incorporated into the viral rna80 studies on the ebola virus involving favipiravir have shown promising outcomes in vitro and in small animal trials40 42 43 in 2 animal studies with different mice models and treatment regimens treatment with favipiravir was associated with a 100 survival rate42 43 however the outcome of a phase ii clinical trial was not as clear51 in the nonrandomized cohort study patients were stratified based on their baseline cycle threshold value reflecting their viral load only patients with moderate to high viremia cycle threshold value  20 showed a tendency for a lower mortality rate compared with historical records although the difference was not statistically significant51 in a single-center retrospective study by bai et al58 a series of 39 treated patients with medium to high viral load showed a significantly higher survival rate compared with the control group additional randomized multicenter trials are necessary to confirm efficacy in target groups and to eliminate confounding variables azithromycin is a well-established antibiotic commonly prescribed for the treatment of various bacterial infections in addition it has been proposed to have some anti-viral activity in the treatment of upper respiratory tract viral infections81 these effects are believed to be the result of the amplification of the systemic antiviral response mediated by the ifn pathway it is not known to have a direct antiviral inhibitory effect azithromycin was among several drugs investigated for anti-ebola virus activity in vitro and in small animal models48 it has shown potent in vitro inhibition of the ebola virus small animal studies generated mixed results in a murine model treatment with 100 mgkg azithromycin twice daily was initially associated with a 60 survival rate compared with 20 for the control group p  002 repeat testing under identical conditions did not reproduce statistically significant results in addition a different treatment regimen with 210 mgkg oral azithromycin po once daily was associated with a 0 survival rate an efficacy screening using different doses of azithromycin on guinea pigs similarly did not yield positive outcomes48 this systematic review was carried out on the basis of a previously published protocol to comprehensively search and select relevant studies and to identify potential repurposed drugs for evd however limitations that are either inherent to the methodology applied in this review or to the studies included still exist first despite a search strategy that was designed to be highly sensitive we cannot be certain that all studies on this topic have been captured this is due to the pressing nature of an acute evd epidemic which resulted in a rapidly evolving research scene with many studies currently underway82 second this review was synthesized narratively which may increase the risk of bias if 1 study is given more weight compared with others83 efforts to avoid such bias in this review include systematic selection of articles extraction of data and identification of potential drugs by 2 authors independently multireviewer extraction has been previously shown to decrease the risk of error compared with single-reviewer extraction84 there are several limitations inherent to the studies included in this review first a clear majority of included studies were categorized as screening in vitro or animal studies results from these studies cannot be used to reliably predict a positive response in humans85 86 in our review only 3 studies were carried out on nonhuman primates which are considered the gold standard for filovirus models because they resemble the human clinical manifestation of filoviral disease87 the remaining 11 animal studies were carried out using adapted small animal models such as mice hamsters and guinea pigs which are not naturally susceptible to the ebola virus in these studies it was necessary to use a genetically adapted virus that has undergone numerous mutations to achieve virulence and lethality the genetic variation of an adapted ebola virus together with differences in disease development compared with infected humans limit our ability to extrapolate results from these studies furthermore our risk of bias assessment revealed a high risk of bias for 13 out of 14 animal studies this limitation appears to be a shared concern amongst other fields of drug development88 our review included a total of 9 clinical studies that did not have a high level of internal validity or a high level of evidence based on the oxford 2011 levels of evidence89 4 out of 9 studies are case reports or case series with a low level of evidence52 53 54 55 and 5 trials are nonrandomized studies with a midrange level of evidence51 56 57 58 59 this lack of high-level evidence may have several reasons first until the recent evd epidemic this condition has been neglected and no major clinical research attempts were carried out second clinical research during an outbreak faces many ethical and practical obstacles that influence study design the number of participants and settings90 91 this systematic review offers a comprehensive overview on the current state of the art with regard to drug repurposing for evd it addresses the different stages of repurposed drug development for evd from screening chemical libraries to clinical trials authors of the review identified 11 therapeutic agents with potentially promising therapeutic influence on evd at this stage none of these therapeutic agents can be recommended for the treatment of evd this review highlights the need for well-designed and well-conducted preclinical and clinical research to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the proposed indication it may be a useful aid for researchers to identify gaps in the evidence on the various drugs presented the authors have indicated that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the content of this article  matrix metallopeptidase 9 as a host protein target of chloroquine and melatonin for immunoregulation in covid-19 a network-based meta-analysis suvojit hazra alok chaudhuri ghosh basant tiwary k nilkanta chakrabarti   the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a severe respiratory illness caused by human coronavirus hcov also known as sars severe acute respiratory syndrome-cov-2 or novel coronavirus which contains a single-stranded rna genome 1 2 3 the virus can primarily produce influenza-like symptoms viz fever and myalgia along with pneumonia-like symptoms viz dry cough and shortness of breath however in extreme condition acute respiratory distress syndrome ards multiorgan failure and death may result 24 5 6 7 the transmission of sars-cov-2 from human to human occurs mostly by physical contacts nasal droplets uncooked foods and excreta of conciliator animals 12 the sars-cov-2 phylogenetically belongs to other hcovs under the genera of beta-coronaviruses viz epidemic sars-cov and mers middle east respiratory syndrome-cov the whole genome of sars-cov-2 has 79 nucleotide sequence homology to that of sars-cov the surface envelope spike glycoprotein-s is the major antigen of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 having 75 amino acid similarity the glycoprotein-s binds to its receptor a plasma membrane bound protein called angiotensin converting enzyme subtype 2 ace2 of human allowing endocytosis of the complexes and entry of viruses into the host cells 128 the host defense mechanism during hcov infection gets compromised as the immune defense responses against the interferons occur late which ensures enough time for replication and survival of the viruses 9 clinically interferon supplementation in covid-19 patients has been reported to reduce the virus load and inflammatory insult 10 extensive review analyses using non-randomized clinical studies 611 12 13 14 15 and in vitroculture studies 16 17 18 reveal that several approved drugs including anti-viral remdesevir 13141617 anti-retroviral ritonavir darunavir lopinavir 1315 anti-malarial chloroquine hydroxychloroquine 1314161719 anti-protozoal nitazoxanide ivermectin 1418 and immunosuppressive tocilizumab 13 agents may be the choice of treatment for covid-19 monoclonal antibody against the spike protein of sars-cov-2 has been raised in view of developing protection against covid-19 20 moreover the network analysis based on the human coronavirus genome and host protein interactome has recently proposed that some repurposed drugs including anti-inflammatory agent melatonin non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator toremifene angiotensin receptor blockers eg irbesartan immunosuppressants eg sirolimus anti-neoplastic drugs eg mercaptopurine and a natural plant product emodin having antiviral activities may be the likely candidates for treatment of covid-19 21 however all these pharmacologic agents suffer from certain limitations in their uses due to the paucity of information about the molecular pathogenesis of covid-19 and its best suitable treatment the present study has been executed with potential systems biology approach using integrative protein-protein and chemo-protein network analyses to find out a the most effective host protein targets in human and b the putative drugs against the targets to establish a functional link between drugs vs targeted host proteins for better understanding of treatment strategy in covid-19 the microarray dataset gse1739 of gene expression profiles in the blood of 10 sars-cov patients along with that of four healthy individuals were collected from the ncbi gene expression omnibus geo database diagnostic profiles and experimental assay with the including and excluding selection criteria for human subjects had been described in the original publication 22 the basic packages of the bioconductor project 23 were used for retrieval background correction logarithmic transformation and quantile normalization of the data in r language and environment 24 a 95 confidence interval was applied to select the data for further analysis further the r package limma 25 was implemented to analyze the expressions of genes in patients and healthy individuals the lmfit function was used to fit the linear model using the least square method followed by another function ebayes a hierarchical bayesian model for computation of moderated t-statistics on the linear model to find differential gene expression the moderated t-statistics uses an empirical bayesian shrinkage estimator to reduce the variance dependency for a specific gene on its mean expression values 26 the differential expression of genes was computed using false discovery rate fdr based on benjamini and hochberg method 27 with the criteria of adjusted p-value  005 and log2fc  1 fc representing fold change for each comparison the degs found in the present study had been incorporated on the string 110 database 28 with the settings for active interaction from all enable sources textmining experiments databases co-expression neighborhood gene fusion co-occurrence the reliable interaction strength was detected by applying parameter customized confidence score of 0600 as threshold to filter out spurious interactions the study included only the moderate and high probable interactions between the protein partners of differentially expressed genes to construct an integrative physical protein-protein interaction ppi network model for the characterization of molecular interactions involved in sars-cov infection then the systematic review had been performed to acquire recent relevant literatures associated with covid-19 therapy in pubmed database wwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed using the following keywords sarssars-cov covid-19 treatment therapy therapeutics andor drug respectively the search results were filtered with publication date 1 year for the latest updates on covid-19 therapies to select drug compounds from the latest literatures 18212930 the drugs targeted to covid-19sars-cov-2 treatment selected and degs identified from the peripheral blood samples of sars-cov patients found in the present study were submitted to stitch 50 database 31 with the

 and these drugs were included in further analysis for selection of most potent drugs against putative protein targets the interactome model of cpi network was constructed using covid-19 drug candidates and degs of sars-cov patients in stitch webtool total 88 nodes proteins and drugs and 120 connections had been found in the cpi network data not shown the characterization of protein-drug interactions in covid-19 had been executed through development of interactome model of ppi-cpi network in cytoscape by merging the already identified ppi and cpi network and that was found to be composed of 118 nodes proteins and drugs interconnected by 293 interactions fig 3a the identification of nodes of gene productsproteins and drugs has been designated by the corresponding gene ids and name of the drugs respectively in the present study accordingly the respective gene ids have been used as the node protein identifiers in the further descriptions from the interactome model of ppi-cpi network the mcode module in cytoscape identified only one top-ranked sub-network cluster having mcode score 933 that comprised 35 nodes proteins and drugs with 174 interconnections fig 3b among which 31 nodes appeared to be protein molecules and four viz chloroquine melatonin propranolol and quinacrine were found to be drug candidates the sub-network fig 3b contributed the 5938 major connections and 2966 nodes in the overall interactome model of ppi-cpi network fig 3a the top-ranked sub-network showed hub-bottleneck nodes consisting of 12 proteins and drugs with high topological centrality index values high node connectivity high betweenness and high stresses each with greater mean cut-off threshold values that include 10 proteins corresponding to genes viz camp cct2 elane foxo3 itgam mmp9 mpo sirt1 smad4 stat1 and two drug candidates namely chloroquine and melatonin fig 4ac the hub-bottleneck nodes were identified using the cut-off thresholds of node degree value 502 node betweenness value 27721 and node stress value 9340 applied to the top-ranked sub-network fig 4ab among the 10 hub proteins fig 4c six proteins corresponding to respective upregulated genes camp elane foxo3 itgam mmp9 mpo and four proteins corresponding to respective downregulated genes cct2 sirt1 smad4 stat1 as evident in their expression profile in fig 2 only matrix metallopeptidase 9 mmp9 protein had been found to interact with both hub drug nodes namely chloroquine and melatonin in the top ranked sub-network fig 3b mmp9 had been found as the second largest hub node consisting of connectivities with 23 nodes 19 protein and four drug partners notably the first largest hub node elane had connectivities with 26 nodes without having any interacting drug partner fig 3b furthermore the other hub node foxo3 appeared to have connectivity with melatonin as the only interacting drug partner fig 3b however there is no evidence in support of the involvement of gene product of foxo3 with the respiratory viral infection therefore our present results clearly indicated that mmp9 could be the most potent host protein target of chloroquine and melatonin as interacting drugs in covid-19 gene enrichment analysis study fig 5

nuclear hormone receptor bindings iron and transition metal ion bindings serine-type endopeptidase activities endonuclease and ribonuclease activities and rna polymerase-ii core promoter proximal region sequence-specific dna bindings were also associated with the gene products of this sub-network in addition kegg pathway enrichment study included certain signaling pathways foxo nod-like receptor and prolactin several types of microbial infections exerted by staphylococcus aureus mycobacterium tuberculosis leishmania donovani and hepatitis-b virus and cancer pancreatic and acute myeloid leukemia in association with the gene products of the sub-network jensen disease enrichment data indicated that the respiratory system disorders lung diseases bronchitis and common colds immunoinflammation related complications wegeners granulomatosis mastitis arthritis eosinophilia brain edema periodontal disease were highly enriched in association with the gene products of the top-ranked sub-network the present study developed a chemo-protein interactome network fig 3a on basis of differentially expressed genes in sars-cov infection fig 2 and repurposed drugs for covid-19 table 1 a sub-network fig 3b was identified that appeared to be involved in neutrophil activation and degranulation pathways fig 5 the functionally important hub node mmp9 an immunogenic protease linked to the degradation of cellular matrix was revealed as the target fig 5 of two repurposed promising drug candidates figs 3b and 4c ie chloroquine antimalarial drug and melatonin pineal hormone in covid-19 here the systematic analytical approach using data integration reveals the global systems-level relationship drug vs target vs functional annotation in covid-19 ards is the main cause of morbidities in covid-19 and infections of other coronaviruses 5 6 73738 cytokine storm is a key mechanism of ards materialization leading to multiorgan failure and death 563940 till date the molecular pathogenesis of covid-19 is unclear therefore the similar mechanism of sars-covmers-cov infection can confer a lot to the molecular level of understanding in pathogenesis of covid-19 6 the present study identified a sub-network fig 3b that includes the statistically significant pathways of both neutrophil activation and degranulation fig 5 the sub-network comprised 2966 nodes proteins and provided 5938 connectivities of the overall network which indicated the colossal importance of this sub-network in the whole network model fig 3ab the global and local topological analyses provided ten potential protein molecules consisting of six proteins corresponding to respective upregulated genes camp elane foxo3 itgam mmp9 and mpo and four proteins corresponding to respective downregulated genes cct2 sirt1 smad4 and stat1 these ten nodes appeared to be the hub nodes of the ppi-cpi interactome network and were chosen for further study fig 4c all these molecules had been found to be highly enriched in blood after antimicrobial-induced neutrophil-mediated humoral and innate immunity responses in covid-19 fig 5 in the present study mmp9 was found as the functionally important hub node protein and target of the drugs in the central hub node of the ppi-cpi interactome network figs 3b and 4c matrix metallopeptidases mmps the zinc-containing and calcium-dependent proteolytic endopeptidases are released from the intracellular stores and become active extracellularly 41 mmps cause deterioration of a number of extracellular matrix proteins that help in the extracellular matrix remodelling in various physiological and pathological processes including inflammation 41 42 43 44 mmps are widely distributed in tissues and their expressions are controlled by cytokines growth factors and hormones mmp9 83kd a glycoprotein with type-iv collagenase activity is found in neutrophils lymphocytes and dendritic cells that are involved in angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokine generation 4144 notably the enrichr functional analysis in the current study revealed mmp9 as to be associated with transition ion binding molecular function under gene ontology and diverse pathophysiological conditions viz neutrophil activation and related immunity biological process under gene ontology transcriptional misregulation in cancer and hepatitis b infection kegg pathways arthritis brain edema and common cold infection jensen disease in human fig 5 the computational study using functional pathways enrichment analysis has also reported the bidirectional regulation of mmp9 gene expression in diverse viral infections and predicted mmp9 as the repurposing drug target 45 mmp9 is constitutively expressed at low level under physiological condition the mmp9 action depends on the balance between its pro-peptide activation by a serine protease plasmin and inhibition through formation of complexes with tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease 1 timp1 therefore the dysregulations of mmp9 systems gene expressions post-translational modifications levels of activators vs inhibitors lead to the development of pathological conditions 4647 the low level of timp1 and persistent mmp9 activity in neutrophils which bring about airway remodelling and congestion in association with the acute inflammatory responses are implicated in development of both ards and acute asthma 48 49 50 51 recently the gene expressions of timp1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of covid-19 patients have been found to undergo upregulation in one victim and downregulation in another one as well as upregulation in the blood mononuclear cells of the other three victims 52 in the present communication the enrichr functional analysis cellular components database under gene ontology exhibited the association of mmp9 with functional aspects of lumens releasing tertiary granules fig 5 mmp9 is reported to relate with tertiary lumens for release of cytokines during neutrophil activation 53 in monocytes and macrophages mmp9 is over-activated by plasmin and reacts with toll like receptor 9 tlr9 signaling to induce formation of tumour necrosis factor tnf that leads to the development of pro-inflammatory cytokine storm 5455 the involvement of mmp9 with serine protease activities was also noticed in enrichr functional analysis with molecular function under gene ontology fig 5 mmp9 deficiency is found to be protective against severe h1n1 influenza virus a infection in mice model 56 therefore our findings and other reports support the view that the approach to mmp9 inhibition andor alterations of its activators plasmin and inhibitors timp1 may prevent the deadly cytokine storm and the life-risk of covid-19 patients here both chloroquine and melatonin were identified as the repurposed drug candidates that appeared to be the interacting partners of mmp9 figs 3b and 4 chloroquine treatment decreases serum mmp9 level in systemic lupus erythematosus 57 and suppresses mmp9 activity and its mrna expression in breast cancer 58 chloroquine can also lower the tnf-mediated neutrophil apoptosis neutrophil degranulation and cytokine burst 59 60 61 62 63 chloroquinehydroxychloroquine efficiently inhibits the human retrovirus activities in vitro 64 recently a number of studies 176566 and a clinical trial 67 support the use of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 conversely certain clinical studies strongly disagree with its uses 68 69 70 as it develops cardiac failure in covid-19 patients 68 indicating the clinical data about chloroquinehydroxychloroquine are not conclusive 71 notably hydroxychloroquine did not appear in the sub-network in the present study fig 3b and remained unattained for further consideration melatonin is responsible for normal sleep and maintenance of the biological clock in human 72 it has anti-inflammatory properties 7374 exerts its potential role in anti-viral mechanism 74 75 76 77 78 and has also been used in ebola virus infection 78 the pathophysiological observation in covid-19 patients supports the chronobiological uses of melatonin in its treatment 7980 and a therapeutic algorithm in this regard has also been proposed recently 81 in addition melatonin is reported as the promising adjuvant for covid-19 treatment 2182 and its deficiencies may enhance susceptibility of diabetic and hypertensive elderly patients in sars-cov-2 infection 80 the first clinical trial of melatonin in a small cohort indicates its involvement in abating ards in covid-19 patients 83 interestingly melatonin can bind to the active site of mmp9 and inhibit the latter to arrest immunoinflammation 84 thus the present network based meta-analysis justified the involvement of melatonin interaction with mmp9 in immunocompromised covid-19 the cell culture study kidney cell line vero e6 and network analysis reveal that chloroquine 85 and melatonin 21 respectively may have potential anti-viral role in targeting human cell membrane-bound ace2 receptor a zinc dependent carboxypeptidase and other associated protein partners in covid-19 interestingly separate studies report that mmp9 level increases in ace2-knockout mice model 86 and ace inhibitors lisinopril and imidapril also target mmp9 along with ace2 87 therefore both metallopeptidases ie ace2 and mmp9 may have cooperativities for immunoinflammation in covid-19 and can be potential targets of both chloroquine and melatonin therapies the glycoprotein-s of surface spikes of corona viruses including sars-cov-2 recognize the membrane-bound ace2 receptors in airways and lungs for entry into the body ace2 along with transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 triggers conformational changes in the glycoprotein-s and releases s-fragments that enable the fusion of viral envelopes with the host cell membrane followed by internalization of viruses through the formation of endosomes the viral rna is processed within the host cells and replica of viruses are released out of the cells the viral infected cells present antigenic peptides through major histocompatibility complexes and elicit humoral and cellular immunities along with cytokine storm 688 89 90 91 92 93 the ectodomain of membrane-bound ace2 is shed into the extracellular fluid as its soluble form 8894 95 96 in vitro studies also indicate that the soluble ace2 can bind to sars-covsars-cov-2 and is supposed to limit the availability of viruses to interact with the membrane-bound ace2 receptors thus minimizing the chances of viral load 889294 notably ace2 converts angiotensin-ii to angiotensin1-7 a peptide which causes modification of inflammatory processes 97 angiotensin1-7 also has a vasodilatory effect 98 and enhances the heart rate acting on the caudal ventrolateral medulla in the brain 99 which may contribute to the development of hypotension and tachycardia as found in sarscovid-19 patients 100 moreover the interaction of sarssars-cov-2 with the ace2 receptors of the support cells in olfactory mucosa also results in inflammation-induced anosmia 101 further experimental studies are needed to elaborate the regulatory role of ace2 receptor and mmp9 in therapeutic management of covid-19 the present study using network-based systems biology approach clearly demonstrates that a the upregulation of mmp9 gene and status of mmp9 protein with its activityactivity regulators as potentiators of cytokine storms may be the key point of etiopathophysiology of covid-19 and b chloroquine and melatonin may be the drugs that can target mmp9 to reduce the immunoinflammatory cascades associated with ards symptoms in covid-19 patients consistent with the present findings it would also be worthy to mention that the therapeutic actions of both chloroquine and melatonin may have converged onto the activities of cell membrane ace2 receptors of sars-cov-2 recently the use of chloroquine does not appear attractive as it produces cytotoxicity at doses used in the clinical trials in this respect melatonin could be a better promising safe drug that needs more clinical trials in large cohorts to ensure its efficacy in treatment of covid-19 patients the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest  middle east respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome

 since 2003 two human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov emerged as global public health threats sars-cov was first identified in february 2003 in guangdong province peoples republic of china and was transmitted to humans from infected civets likely infected from bats 1 2 sars-cov spread to 29 additional countries and was associated with high morbidity in humans eg atypical pneumonia ultimately sars was contained in 2004 following a highly effective public health response but resulted in 8098 confirmed cases and 774 deaths fig 1a 3 in 2012 mers emerged in the kingdom of saudi arabia and presented as a severe respiratory disease with frequent gastrointestinal and renal complications mers-cov the causative agent of mers was later identified as a coronavirus mers-cov has subsequently spread to 27 additional countries fig 1b 4 as of september 12 2017 2080 confirmed cases of mers and 722 deaths were reported 5
 coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses fig 2 they are members of the coronavirinae subfamily of viruses and together with the torovirinae subfamily comprise the coronaviridae virus family order nidovirales coronavirinae is divided into four genera alpha coronavirus beta coronavirus gamma coronavirus and delta coronavirus the coronaviruses share a similar genome organization the open reading frame 1a and 1b comprise nearly 23 of the genome and encode the nonstructural proteins the multiple structural proteins including spike nucleocapsid envelope and membrane proteins are encoded by downstream open reading frames fig 2 68 sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the beta coronavirus genus however sars-cov belongs to lineage b and mers-cov belongs to lineage c along with bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 as mers-cov and bat coronaviruses are part of lineage c and mers-cov rna was found in a bat sample in the kingdom of saudi arabia researchers hypothesize that bats may be a natural reservoir for mers-cov 9 10 results from a recent study support that bats may be a reservoir for mers-cov however camels and goats are thought to be intermediate hosts 11 in this study mers-cov was isolated from nasal secretions of mers-cov-infected dromedary camels that had a short mild disease progression
 the suspected reservoir for sars-cov is the chinese horseshoe bat 2 however the mechanism of emergence and adaptation to make the virus zoonotic is still not definitely understood 2 sars-cov-like isolates from these bats have up to 95 sequence similarity to human and civet sars-cov during the initial outbreak sars-cov was originally isolated from palm civets found in a chinese market but sars-cov was not found in the wild palm civet population 12 bats harbor many coronaviruses and are considered the main reservoir for later infections in an intermediate host such as civets or camels which spread the disease to humans 2 human-to-human transmission has been most commonly associated with health-care workers and those with close unprotected contact with infected patients 13 14 the clinical features of mers and sars are similar and can range from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure 15 although mers and sars are clinically similar the mers mortality rate is 40 and sarss mortality rate is 10 16 approximately 75 of mers cases were associated with underlying comorbidities with a 60 mortality rate in this subgroup including cardiopulmonary abnormalities obesity and diabetes in contrast 1030 of patients with sars have comorbidities with a mortality rate of 46 within this subgroup 15 16 the development of symptomatic mers and sars mostly occurs in adults median age of 50 years 40 years for sars mers and sars symptoms typically follow a mean incubation time of  5 days range 213 and 214 days respectively and include fever chills cough some associated with blood shortness of breath myalgia headache nausea vomiting diarrhea sore throat and malaise 1517 progression from mild to severe disease is more rapid with mers as compared to sars with means of 7 and 11 days respectively 15 secondary bacterial infections have occurred in patients with severe mers however the role of these coinfections in mers pathogenesis has yet to be determined 1820 laboratory abnormalities associated with mers and sars patients include elevated lactate dehydrogenase elevated liver enzymes thrombocytopenia lymphopenia and leukopenia 2123 radiographic abnormalities consistent with viral pneumonitis and ards are common in mers and sars radiographic progression in the lower lobes has been reported to be more rapid for mers than sars 2123 for sars disease in the lower lobes mimics pneumonia radiographic progression includes ground-glass opacification and lobe thickening 17 mers-cov intact virus or viral genome is found at higher concentrations in the lower respiratory tract than in the upper respiratory tract in mers patients and this may account for inefficient inter-human transmission 15 24 currently no approved therapeutics for patients with mers or sars are available and clinical management has relied primarily on supportive care effectiveness of antiviral treatments used during the sars epidemic has been mainly based on case studies and retrospective analysis of patient cohorts few randomized blinded clinical trials of anti-sars treatments were performed which adds complexity when interpreting the available data table 1 ribavirin a nucleoside analog that prevents rna and dna virus replication was initially used in the treatment of sars due to its broad-spectrum efficacy for example in a taiwanese study 51 sars patients were treated daily with fluoroquinolone antibiotics levofloxacin 500 mg or moxifloxacin 400 mg following diagnosis out of 51 patients 44 sars patients were also treated intravenously iv with 2000 mg of ribavirin then orally daily with 1200 mg while 7 sars patients did not receive ribavirin corticosteroids iv methylprednisolone or oral prednisolone were administered as needed to treat worsening lung infiltrates and fever 25 ribavirin treatment led to hypoxia and anemia and increased risk for death in sars patients in a retrospective analysis a cohort of 229 patients from hong kong singapore and toronto were treated with ribavirin in conjunction with corticosteroids immunoglobulins andor antibiotics 26 ribavirin did not demonstrate efficacy patients in hong kong and singapore were treated with ribavirin at 1200 mg orally at diagnosis followed by oral treatments with 2400 mg daily or continual iv ribavirin therapy 8 mgkg every 8 h h in toronto patients received ribavirin iv treatment with 2000 mg followed by 1000 mg every 6 h for 4 days and 300 mg every 8 h for 3 days unfortunately fatality rates were similar between the ribavirin-treated and control groups later researchers demonstrated that the ribavirin dosage required to be effective against sars-cov in vitro was not clinically achievable 27 ribavirin treatment also resulted in adverse effects including anemia hypoxemia and decreased hemoglobin levels and did not improve patient outcome 26 due to the increasing adverse effects and lack of efficacy health canada stopped permitting the use of ribavirin for sars 25
 additional studies tested the efficacy of ribavirin in conjunction with lopinavir an anti-retroviral agent lopinavir demonstrated in vitro activity against sars-cov 28 in a non-randomized open-enrollment trial of 152 suspected sars patients 27 all patients were treated with ribavirin and corticosteroids similar to the previously described studies in addition 41 of the confirmed sars patients were also treated with a combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg mean viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs within this treatment group decreased to undetectable levels by day 10 overall sars-related symptoms subsided disease progression was milder and no adverse effects were reported as compared to the historical control group in an open-label non-randomized study of 22 sars patients 9 patients who received subcutaneous sc injections of interferon ifn alfacon-1 for 10 days at an initial dose of 9 gday for 2 days increasing to 15 gday with disease progression all 9 patients survived with minor adverse effects 29 the evaluation of treatments in mers patients has been hampered as high-quality clinical data from randomized clinical trials are limited ribavirin with or without ifn or corticosteroids was the primary treatment during the mers outbreak in a retrospective analysis a cohort of 20 patients was treated with oral ribavirin and sc pegylated ifn-2a at a dose of 180 gweek for 2 weeks table 2 30 the initial dose of ribavirin was 2000 mg followed by a 2001200 mg dose depending on creatinine clearance a group of 24 patients that received supportive care and corticosteroids were considered the control group at 14 days after confirmed diagnosis of mers survival was increased in the treated group 70 compared to the control group 29 by 28 days post-diagnosis 30 of treated subjects survived versus 17 of the control group 30 in an additional case study a 69-year-old greek patient who contracted mers in jeddah was treated with oral lopinavirritonavir 400100 mg twice daily pegylated ifn 180 g sc once per week for 12 weeks and ribavirin 2000 mg initial dose 1200 mg every 8 h for 8 days initiated on day 13 post-diagnosis two days after treatment initiation viremia could not be detected however viral rna was detected in several patient samples feces respiratory secretions and serum up to 14 weeks post-diagnosis despite prolonged survival the patient succumbed from septic shock 2 months post-diagnosis 31 an ongoing randomized clinical trial in saudi arabia is evaluating treatment of mers patients with ifn-1b in combination with lopinavirritonavir 32
 loperamide an approved anti-diarrheal agent is on the world health organization who model list of essential medicines and is available in many countries the drug acts on the opioid receptor and reduces intestinal motility 34 results from pharmacokinetic pk studies show that oral loperamide is well absorbed from the gut with less than 1 of the drug entering systemic circulation 35 loperamide demonstrated anti-mers-cov anti-sars and anti-hcov229e activity in an in vitro screen of approved drugs 36 although the mechanism of action is unknown interestingly loperamide was suggested for limiting gastrointestinal fluid and electrolyte losses in patients with ebola virus disease evd 37 the antimalarial agents chloroquine cq amodiaquine and mefloquine have activity against sars-cov and mers-cov in vitro 36 38 39 cq is a us food and drug administration fda-approved antimalarial agent that is also used to treat autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis due to its anti-inflammatory effects 40 cq has activity against a number of viruses in vitro and in vivo including flaviviruses dengue virus denv togaviruses chikungunya virus chikv paramyxoviruses hendra nipah virus influenza viruses hiv and filoviruses ebola virus ebov  4147 several mechanisms of action have been identified for the antiviral effect of cq and suggest that the drug acts nonspecifically at virus entry or at the later stages of virus production cq accumulates within acidic organelles such as endosomes golgi vesicles and lysosomes where the drug is protonated resulting in increased ph within the vesicle 48 viruses depend on these acidic organelles for entry viral replication and maturation of virus progeny similarly mers-cov entry into cells depends on several proteases dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 acts as functional virus receptor 49 and cellular proteases eg type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 and members of the cathepsin family activate the viral spike s glycoprotein 50 cq may have an effect on any of these proteases cq also affects the glycosylation step within the golgi that directs trafficking and maturation of viral proteins 5153 for sars-cov the antiviral activity of cq has also been attributed to a deficit in glycosylation of the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 54 the broad-spectrum antiviral activity makes cq an attractive antiviral for repurposing and treating coronaviral and other emerging viral infections in vivo activity of cq in mers or sars animal models has not yet been reported however the antiviral activity of the drug has been evaluated against other viruses in preclinical and clinical studies with mixed results cq plasma steady state concentrations in mice are similar to those reported for humans 10 m and are within range of the ec50 values determined for mers-cov 36 m and sars-cov 23 m 43 55 preclinical studies with cq in mice against other viruses have shown survival benefits for influenza and ebov infections in clinical studies cq was effective at reducing viral loads in asymptomatic hiv patients 56 57 but results of cq treatment of chikv and denv infections were mixed 58 59 in summary cq has broad-spectrum potential and the information gained from studies on other viruses can be used to plan the most appropriate strategies for evaluating its specific clinical value for treating for mers-cov and sars-cov infections cq has several advantages including rapid absorption from gastrointestinal tract low cost and very effective biodistribution cq may be an excellent candidate for combinatorial treatments with other antivirals however considerable challenges remain for the treatment of viral infections including increased understanding of the pharmacodynamics of cq achievement of sufficient plasma concentrations in patients and toxicity concerns 60 importantly hydroxychloroquine a cq derivate may provide an alternative due to lower toxicity and similar pharmacology profile 55 a related antimalarial drug amodiaquine also has activity in vitro against mers-cov and sars-cov 38 previous investigations have demonstrated that amodiaquine inhibits filovirus replication and the mechanism of action is hypothesized to be similar to that of cq 43 amodiaquine is well tolerated and is commonly used for malaria treatments in many countries further amodiaquine in combination with artesunate was administered to evd patients during the 20132016 epidemic and the resulting decrease in fatality rates may have been associated with the use of amodiaquine as an antimalarial agent 61 nonhuman primate nhp studies are currently underway to investigate the effect of amodiaquine treatment on evd 62 mefloquine a synthetic analog of quinine is another antimalarial drug with activity against mers-cov and sars-cov 38 it belongs to the who model list of essential medicines mefloquine is known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and was found to inhibit jc virus infection and replication at concentrations generally achieved in the brains of patients given mefloquine for malaria 63 leading to the clinical evaluation of this drug for the treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 64 65 in 2013 the fda added a boxed warning to the us label of mefloquine regarding the potential for neuropsychiatric side effects additional investigations are warranted to determine if amodiaquine or mefloquine have value for repurposing for treatment of mers or sars cyclophilins are ubiquitous host proteins believed to have multiple roles in trafficking protein folding and t cell activation 66 cyclosporine a cysa forms a complex with cyclophilin a thereby blocking t cell activation cysa is licensed for use in organ transplantation to suppress the immune response cysa has also been shown to inhibit coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov effectively in cell culture 67 68 however the mechanism has yet to be determined there is increasing evidence that cyclophilins are involved in viral replication of rna viruses such as hepatitis c virus hcv and west nile virus and this may also apply to coronaviruses 69 although the immunosuppressive properties of cysa are considered a risk for treating viral infections in patients nonimmunosuppressive analogs of cysa that bind to cyclophilins with higher affinity have been developed and some are in clinical trials as hcv therapeutics 7072 interferons ifns are approved by the fda for other indications such as hepatitis c although ifn- reduced sars-cov replication in mice and nhps 73 74 efficacy of ifn- treatment in sars patients was mixed see sect 211 from in vitro studies another type i interferon ifn-1a may be more effective than ifn- either alone or in combination with ifn- 7577 combinations of ifn- and - were synergistic against sars-cov in vitro 77 with regards to mers in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have indicated that ifn-2b alone or in combination with ribavirin may have a therapeutic effect if given early in disease 78 79 in clinical trials however ifn-2b given in combination with other treatments did not lead to a significant benefit to patients see sect 212 ifn-1a ec50  137 iuml was superior in activity against mers-cov infection in vitro compared to ifn-2a ifn-2b and ifn- these ifns had ec50 values of 1608 214 and 565 iuml respectively 80 ifn-1b is currently under evaluation for mers-cov in a randomized clinical trial in combination with lopinavirritonavir 32 investigating the ifn- subtypes 1a and 1b in combination with other antivirals may be worthwhile as potential synergistic combinations could reduce the effective drug dosage and ifn-associated adverse effects many cellular processes are regulated independently of changes in transcription or translation through kinase-mediated cell signaling pathways as a testament to the biological importance of kinases there have been over 500 kinases identified along with more than 900 genes encoding proteins with kinase activity 81 82 as of april 2015 28 kinase inhibitors have been granted approval by the us fda with over half gaining approval from 20122015 further kinases are the most frequently targeted gene class in cancer therapy second only to the g protein-coupled receptors as therapeutic targets 83 84 the therapeutic potential for host-targeted immunomodulatory agents in viral infections has received considerable attention 8587 recently dyall et al identified two abelson abl kinase inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib that inhibited mers-cov and sars-cov infection through a cell-screening assay 38 both compounds significantly inhibited mers-cov and sars-cov with micromolar ec50 values and low cytotoxicity abl2 has been identified as critical for mers-cov and sars-cov virus entry and may be the target that imatinib inhibits to block entry of both viruses 88 a recent systems kinome analysis investigation of in vitro mers-cov infection suggested that erkmapk and pi3 kaktmtor signaling pathways were specifically modulated during infection 89 subsequent analysis of licensed kinase inhibitors targeting these pathways demonstrated that kinase inhibitors targeting the erkmapk signal pathway selumetinib and trametinib inhibited mers-cov infection by  95 when added pre- or post-infection 89 further trametinib demonstrated significantly stronger inhibitory activity against mers-cov than selumetinib suggesting that specific intermediates of the erkmapk signaling pathway may represent crucial foci during early viral entry and late viral replication events in the viral life cycle in contrast sorafenib an inhibitor of raf-1 and b-raf components of the erkmapk signaling pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 vegfr2 inhibited mers-cov infection by  90 when added to cells prior to infection however the inhibitory activity was reduced to  30 when added post-infection suggesting raf kinases were primarily involved in early viral life cycle events in addition the inhibitory activity dabrafenib a raf kinase inhibitor was also largely ablated when added post-infection miltefosine an alkyl phospholipid considered to be an inhibitor of protein kinase b akt garnered fda approval for infectious disease-related treatments cutaneous or mucosal leishmaniasis 90 in 2013 miltefosine became directly available from the us centers for diseases control and prevention for the treatment of free-living amoeba infections 91 pre-treatment of cells with miltefosine reduced mers-cov infection by 28 but had no effect when added post-infection 89 in contrast inhibition of mtor with sirolimus or everolimus reduced mers-cov infection by  60 when added prior pre- or post-infection suggesting a critical role for mtor in mers-cov infection a recent clinical investigation by wang et al 92 evaluated sirolimus and corticosteroids in addition to standard antiviral treatment in a randomized controlled trial in patients with severe h1n1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure 92 importantly the addition of sirolimus was associated with improved patient outcomes including decreased hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction reduced mean times for liberation from mechanical ventilation and increased clearance of virus thus it may be prudent to extend the study of repurposed kinase inhibitors beyond stand-alone therapeutic investigations and also consider their potential as adjunctive therapies numerous neurotransmitter receptors inhibitors showed activity against mers-cov and sars-cov infection 38 these drugs were initially developed as antipsychotics antihistamines and sedatives five neurotransmitter receptor antagonists belong to the chemical class of phenothiazines chlorpromazine triflupromazine thiethylperazine promethazine and fluphenazine phenothiazines were breakthrough medications developed in the 1950s for treating mental health patients and reduced episodes of bizarre behavior hallucinations and irrational thoughts 93 although phenothiazines primarily block dopamine receptors they also have anticholinergic antihistamine and antiemetic effects the phenothiazines chlorpromazine and triflupromazine are approved antipsychotics chlorpromazine has been used off-label for short-term treatment of nausea and migraines triflupromazine is used to treat severe emesis but the drug has more serious side effects than chlorpromazine including akathisia and tardive dyskinesia the antiviral effect of chlorpromazine has been extensively studied and the drug interferes with clathrin-mediated endocytosis a process that many viruses exploit for host cell entry chlorpromazine inhibits entry of junin virus 94 west nile virus 95 ebov 96 hcv 97 and japanese encephalitis virus 98 suggesting broad-spectrum activity that could be exploited early during a novel virus outbreak chlorpromazine may have similar effects on coronaviruses as the drug effectively inhibits mers-cov sars-cov and human coronavirus 229e expressing green fluorescent protein 36 38 however time-of-addition studies indicate that the inhibitory activity against mers-cov is retained whether added pre- or post-infection suggesting that there are additional effects to clathrin-mediated entry impairment 36 thiethylperazine is an approved antiemetic both chlorpromazine and thiethylperazine have been shown to inhibit alphaviruses semliki forest virus sfv and chikungunya virus chikv 45 99 as these drugs cross the brain-blood barrier use of these drugs could be beneficial in the treatment of chikv including common neurologic complications promethazine is an antihistamine used as a sedative in many countries under different brand names but also acts as a weak anti-psychotic activity fluphenazine is a common antipsychotic used to treat chronic psychoses primarily schizophrenia and belongs to the who model list of essential medicines promethazine and fluphenazine have shown in vitro activity against mers-cov and sars-cov and may have value as candidates for repurposing for coronaviral infections 38 benztropine mesylate an approved anticholinergic used to treat parkinsons had activity against mers-cov and sars-cov 38 benztropine was also identified in other screens of clinically approved drugs for antiviral activities against hcv and ebov 100102 although the detailed mechanism of action is unknown hcv studies indicate that benztropine inhibits at a virus entry step while not interfering with viral genome replication transcription or production of viral progeny or virus production of viral progeny 102 it has been argued that a virus entry inhibitor may have value in decreasing the incidence of relapse in chronic hcv patients that receive liver transplants 102 however the peak plasma concentrations of benztropine may be too low to be effective for treating an acute infection 103 benztropine was also independently identified in two drug screens for ebov antivirals 100 101 a recent report suggests that a step after virus attachment but prior to viralcell membrane fusion is targeted by benztropine 104 clomipramine a tricyclic antidepressant and thiothixene a thioxanthene antipsychotic have also been shown to inhibit mers-cov and sars-cov infection in vitro 38 in addition they were found to inhibit evd vlp entry 101 both are approved clinically and clomipramine belongs to the who model list of essential medicines several other neurotransmitter inhibitors astemizole promethazine chlorphenoxamine and fluspirilene were active against mers-cov and sars-cov in cell culture but we were not able to find reports on activity against other viruses 38 astemizole is an h1-histamine receptor antagonist for treating allergic rhinitis that was withdrawn from the market cardiac adverse events due to drug overdose have been reported but are extremely rare 105 recently astemizole has gained renewed interest as an anticancer and antimalarial drug 106 107 chlorphenoxamine is an antihistamine and anticholinergic that is currently in preclinical trials for malaria fluspirilene is an approved antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia it is a known autophagy inducer 108 autophagy is a cellular degradative pathway that viruses exploit for their propagation 109 modulators of autophagy may perturb mers-cov or sars-cov infection and investigation of their broad-spectrum potential for the treatment of coronaviral infections would be interesting 110 several rnadna synthesis inhibitors have broad-spectrum activity against viruses including sars-cov and mers-cov 38 80 111114 inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh inhibitors such as ribavirin mycophenolic acid and mizoribine inhibit an important step in de novo synthesis of nucleic acids although the potency of these drugs against viruses varies ribavirin has been used in combination with ifn in the clinic for treatment of viral infections such as hepatitis c treatment regimens with ribavirin are well characterized and have been used in sars and mers patients with mixed results see 21 ribavirin weakly inhibits mers-cov in vitro and conflicting data have been reported for the activity of ribavirin against sars-cov 80 111 115 many of the studies on ribavirin were performed in vero cells that reportedly have a defect in ribonucleoside uptake which could explain lack of activity for ribavirin in these cells 116 another coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv becomes sensitive to ribavirin when its exoribouclease activity is inactivated in presence of exoribonuclease ribavirin does not inhibit mhv replication 117 the mhv exoribonuclease has been suggested to function as a proofreading viral enzyme that is necessary for high-fidelity replication of mhv similarly the exoribonuclease activity of mers-cov and sars-cov could possibly counteract inhibitory activity of ribavirin mycophenolic acid mpa an immunosuppressant used to prevent organ rejection has broad-spectrum antiviral activities and antifungal antibacterial anticancer and antipsoriatic properties 45 118 119 although mpa has weak inhibitory activity against sars-cov in vitro it has promising activity against mers-cov 80 112 a potential alternative to mpa the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil has improved oral bioavailability 120 mycophenolate mofetil evaluated in the common marmoset model of mers did not reduce disease manifestations compared to that observed in control subjects 121 however the mers marmoset model does not recapitulate human disease due to its rapid onset and pathology associated with exposure methods 122 mizoribine an approved immunosuppressant in organ transplantation with limited adverse side effects has shown in vitro activity against hcv and bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv and was considered as an alternative to ribavirinifn combinations for treatment of hcv infections 123 in vivo analysis of ribavirin and other impdh inhibitors in sars-cov-infected mice have suggested that these agents would be of limited benefit 111 the chemotherapeutic gemcitabine has shown in vitro activity against mers-cov and sars-cov 38 the drugs anti-cancer mechanism is attributed to its ability to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase essential for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis gemcitabine has been shown to suppress influenza virus rna transcription and replication by targeting ribonucleotide reductase and showed anti-retroviral activity in vivo in the mouse model for murine leukemia virus 124 125 mers-cov and sars-cov require activation of their envelope glycoproteins by host proteases for cell entry by the endosomal or the non-endosomal pathways inhibitors of host cell proteases are being investigated as possible antivirals 126 the serine protease tmprrss2 mediates entry via the non-endosomal pathway for both mers-cov and sars-cov 50 127129 camostat mesylate which has been used in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis inhibits tmpssr2-mediated glycoprotein activation of mers-cov sars-cov and influenza virus 126 130132 k11777 a cysteine protease inhibitor is in clinical development for treating parasitic infections k11777 has broad-spectrum activity against coronaviruses mers-cov sars-cov hcov-229e filoviruses ebov marburg virus and paramyxoviruses nipah virus 133 interestingly zhou et al 133 demonstrated that camostat and k11777 had inhibitory activity against sars-cov whereas ebov was only inhibited by k11777 suggesting differential host protease requirements for these viruses 133 e-64-d an inhibitor of an endosomal cysteine protease currently in phase iii trials for the treatment of muscular dystrophy inhibits both mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro 38 e-64-d also inhibits filovirus cell entry 134 135 the dependency of viruses for specific serine or cysteine host proteases must be considered in the selection of protease inhibitors for antiviral therapeutic applications therefore an increased understanding of the relationship between host proteases and viral pathogenesis will determine the most effective treatment options for viral infections lopinavir was identified as an inhibitor of mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro and time-of-addition experiments indicate that the drug acts at an early stage of viral entry 36 lopinavir an inhibitor of the hiv protease is used clinically for the treatment of hiv infections 136 it is given in combination with ritonavir an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 3a4 to increase blood concentrations because of the low bioavailability of lopinavir 136 lopinavir also inhibits human papilloma virus and is currently under development for the topical treatment of cervical cancer 137 treatment with lopinavirritonavir resulted in reduced mortality in a nhp model of mers 121 lopinavir has been shown to target the main protease mpro of sars-cov 138 however lopinavir has also been shown to act on other intracellular processes that are involved in coronavirus replication additional studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of action of lopinavir involving cellular proteases during the 2003 sars outbreak patients in open clinical trials were treated with lopinavirritonavir in combination with ribavirin had a milder disease course and reduction in fatality rate compared to that observed with historical controls 27 28 three protein synthesis inhibitors with activity against coronaviruses were identified emetine anisomycin and omacetaxine mepesuccinate 38 139 emetine a natural plant alkaloid and anisomycin an antibiotic both inhibit protein elongation and were identified as anti-protozoals 140 141 while emetine is approved for amoebiasis treatment anisomycin did not move beyond clinical trials 141 142 dehydroemetine a synthetic emetine derivative has fewer side effects and is available as an investigational new drug 143 144 anisomycin was originally discovered as a peptidyl transferase inhibitor but also activates the map kinase signaling pathway 145 in addition to activity against mers-cov and sars-cov emetine and anisomycin inhibit the animal picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus 146 anisomycin has in vitro activity against poliovirus 147 omacetaxine mepesuccinate a plant-derived alkaloid is an anticancer therapeutic that received fda approval in 2012 for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia omacetaxine inhibits mers-cov bovine coronavirus human enteric coronavirus and hepatitis b virus 139 148 in spite of omacetaxine broad spectrum anti-coronavirus activity the drug had no activity against sars-cov 38 drugs that inhibit coronaviruses by targeting protein synthesis may have potential in the development of combination therapies with drugs that target other antiviral pathways recent investigations have demonstrated the potential of estrogen receptor er antagonists for repurposing as anti-coronavirus compounds 38 for example toremifene citrate and tamoxifen citrate with activity against sars-cov and mers-cov were developed and approved as anticancer therapeutics both drugs have shown activity against hcv replication in vitro 149 150 mechanistic studies revealed that the er is functionally associated with hcv replication 150 er promotes the interaction between the hcv replication complex and the hcv polymerase ns5b ermediated regulation of hcv genome replication is abrogated by tamoxifen toremifene and tamoxifen also effectively inhibit ebov infection in vitro 151 however in contrast to hcv mechanistic studies have shown that toremifene-mediated ebov inhibition is independent of the er pathway as toremifene was still active against ebov in cells that did not express er 151 152 toremifene acts at a late step of virus entry after internalization of ebov and may prevent fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes 151153 based on the chemical structure toremifene is a cationic amphiphilic drug cad that is known to be lysosomotropic and could affect endosomal processes during virus entry 151 154 treatment with toremifene led to 50 survival of ebovinfected mice confirming that this drug has an effect in vivo as well 151 in terms of clinical application toremifene and tamoxifen have good bioavailability safety and tolerability profiles combined with a long history of use in the clinic however prolongation of the qt interval has been noted for toremifene and should not be prescribed to patients with congenital or acquired long qt syndrome uncorrected hypokalemia or uncorrected hypomagnesemia 155 tamoxifen can increase uterine malignancies stroke and pulmonary embolism in women with ductal carcinoma in situ or at high risk for breast cancer 156 despite these side effects the drugs may have substantial value for short-term treatment of acute coronaviral infections advanced patient studies and careful evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profiles may facilitate dosing strategies that limit the risk of adverse events two sterol synthesis inhibitors terconazole and triparanol have shown activity against mers-cov and sars-cov 38 studies with virus-like particles vlps have demonstrated that terconazole inhibits coronavirus cell entry including mers-cov and sars-cov the sterol synthesis pathway has been shown to be required for infection by several viruses including hcv 157 158 terconazole approved for vaginal yeast infections can be administered orally topically or by suppository triparanol was approved for lowering plasma cholesterol but was withdrawn due to numerous side effects both are cads that induce accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes and have been shown to inhibit ebov entry 152 in addition to drug repurposing development of novel antiviral countermeasures is needed for emerging coronaviruses to this end design or development strategies have targeted the viral replication cycle and host pathways essential for viral replication table 4 two nucleoside inhibitors of viral rna-dependent rna polymerases gs-5734 and bcx4430 have potential as broad-spectrum antivirals 159 160 both drugs are active against mers-cov and sars-cov in cell culture but in vivo efficacy remains to be investigated in addition a new class of nucleosides with a flexible purine base has anti-coronaviral activity and further optimization could generate potent inhibitors of the coronaviral polymerase 161 the surface glycoprotein s of sars-cov and mers-cov and other coronaviruses consists of two domains s1 containing the receptor-binding domain rbd needed for extracellular binding and s2 containing the fusion peptide needed for membrane fusion and release endocytosis of sars-cov is facilitated by the binding of rbd with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on host cells membrane-bound cathepsin l cleaves the s protein revealing the s2 fusion protein which fuses with the membrane and releases the viral rna inhibitors of cathepsin l the ace2sarss1 complex or the s2 fusion peptide could be suitable targets to inhibit sars-cov entry 162 results from recent studies have identified inhibitors of viral entry viral proteases and helicases that potently inhibit both mers-cov and sars-cov 162 proteases such as papain-like protease and 3c-like protease could also be useful as antiviral targets for drug development as they are required for cleaving non-structural proteins for viral maturation most protease inhibitors are suicide protease inhibitors that bind to the target irreversibly however reversible protease inhibitors may have greater potential as they are less toxic and better tolerated 113 recent studies with helicase inhibitors show that three domain targets n-terminal metal binding domain a hinge domain and a ntphelicase domain have potential for the development of new drugs 163
 directed rna interference rnai presents a powerful approach for the development of novel virus-specific therapeutics based on gene silencing 164 recent studies have shown that small interfering rnas sirnas or short hairpin rnas can inhibit expression of viral genes and thereby block the replication of sars-cov in cultured cells 165172 intranasal delivery of a combination of small interfering rna sisc2-5 targeting sars-cov open reading frame 1 and s protein decreased sars pathogenesis in nhps 173 potential rnai candidates identified through computational modeling for mers-cov require further in vitro and preclinical investigation 174 several rnai therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections have entered clinical trials including tkm-ebola a sirnalipid nanoparticle platform targeting ebov 164 175 176 this technology has great potential for therapeutics for emerging viruses as viral genome sequencing can now be completed in a very short time frame that is crucial in situations when an epidemic of a novel emerging viral infection unfolds the main obstacle for rnai strategies lies in the identification of suitable viral targets and in the delivery efficiency of nucleic acids to target cells in vivo peptides share common physicochemical properties with cads that facilitate interaction with cell membranes and interference with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes during virus entry researchers are making progress in defining the mechanism of action of peptide entry inhibitors of enveloped viruses such as enfuvirtide an approved hiv inhibitor 177 enfuvirtide is a 36-residue peptide derived from the amphipathic loopc-helix heptad repeat domain of hiv gp41 a rational approach based on scanning fusion protein sequences for amphipathic sequences has led to the discovery of additional peptide inhibitors for other viruses including mers-cov and sars-cov 178180 chemical modifications of peptides have increased their in vivo stability and bioavailability improving their potential for clinical applications as novel broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors 181183 the success of palivizumab for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection has reinvigorated efforts to develop monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics for infectious diseases 184 zmapp a monoclonal antibody cocktail targeting ebov has been tested in nhps with success and was moved to phase i and ii clinical trials in humans during the evd epidemic 185 186 similarly a monoclonal antibody against hendra virus has been administered to humans on a compassionate use basis 187189 these examples demonstrate the potential for antibody therapy to combat emergingre-emerging viruses and similar strategies have been pursued by multiple groups for development of antibodies to mers-cov 190197 monoclonal antibodies to mers-cov have been sourced from humanized mice libraries or human antibody libraries 192 194 197 198 antibodies target the s rbd s1 or s2 subunits and have demonstrated efficacy in animal models as reviewed in ying et al 199 monoclonal antibody therapy can impart a selective pressure for generation of resistant viruses although mutants escaping monoclonal antibody pressure tend to be less fit analysis of the emergence of mutations that confer resistance to the monoclonal antibody will need to be performed an alternative to monoclonal antibody therapy is polyclonal antibody therapy using convalescent sera sera sourced from a nonhuman or humanized animal polyclonal antibodies provide an advantage over monoclonal antibodies in that escape mutants are less likely to emerge 200 201 convalescent sera have been recommended for mers and a phase ii interventional clinical trial is ongoing to determine efficacy 198 however the availability of a suitable donor subject presents a significant complication for this approach nonhuman animal sera has been considered but safety concerns limit this option fractionation of nonhuman sera is an alternative however antibody-mediated clearance can be limited due to failure of the human fc receptors to recognize the antibody heavy chain an alternative is de-speciating the antibodies by using only the fab antibody fragment however cost and sufficient material may make mass production of fab fragments difficult the use of sera from humanized mice or other small laboratory animals is complicated by sample acquisitionvolume restraints larger laboratory animals may provide a potential alternative sab biotherapeutics has developed a trans-chromosomic bovine platform for the generation of human igg antibodies 201 vaccination of trans-chromosomic cattle with s protein nanoparticles or inactivated whole virus generated fully humanized polyclonal antibodies that demonstrated efficacy in the ad-dpp4 murine model of mers despite extensive efforts over the past 30 years a therapeutic or prophylactic hiv vaccine has remained elusive antiviral agents are the only available treatments for aids over 25 antivirals belonging to 6 different drug classes targeting different stages of viral replication are available eg reverse transcriptase protease fusion entry integrase 203 combination treatments with 2 to 3 drugs are effective and result in a sustained virologic response 204 two aspects have been found to be important for avoiding resistance 1 selecting drugs with at least two different targets and 2 selecting drugs that belong to different chemical classes these considerations may also apply for drug combinations with synergistic effects against mers- and sars-cov broad-spectrum antiviral therapies can be of great value for treating emerging infections when it takes time to develop direct-acting antivirals for treatment of chronic hepatitis c clinicians have depended on ifn and ribavirin for a number of years 205 eventually ifn and ribavirin combination was replaced by very effective fixed-combination therapies using direct-acting antivirals that target multiple steps of the hcv life cycle 206 ifn and ribavirin contribute significantly to the treatment of viral infections for which no direct-acting antivirals exist however they have major side effects 207 more options for broad-spectrum antivirals with improved safety profiles would be beneficial for use for emerging coronavirus infections influenza viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate of the rna genome as available vaccines may not be protective against a novel pandemic strain antiviral agents are considered an essential component for preparedness combinations of direct-acting antivirals are under evaluation for additive or synergistic effects and prevention of resistance 208 209 one triple combination oseltamivir amantadine and ribavirin is synergistic and prevents resistance in vivo 210 211 highlighting the potential of combinatorial therapy the recent epidemic of evd in western africa has renewed the urgency for development of treatments against emerging viruses although vaccines and direct-acting antiviral treatment are under investigation none are approved for clinical use 212216 the who prioritized a panel of drugs approved for other indications that were considered for repurposing under fdas emergency use authorization 62 two of these drugs also have activity against mers-cov and sars-cov amodiaquine antimalarial agent and toremifene citrate breast cancer treatment additional broad-spectrum antiviral agents including repurposed drugs should be a top priority for future emerging infections including coronavirus infections a panel of broad-spectrum drugs that have been carefully validated for efficacy and safety and that could be used in combination would supply a minimum of protection for patients and healthcare workers at outbreak locations this panel of drugs could be used in situations of a known re-emerging pathogen for which specific antiviral agents and vaccines has not been approved or of an unknown novel pathogen that could arise effective development of countermeasures depends on developing appropriate animal models that uniformly recapitulate human disease progression and severity of pathological manifestations as with most animal models of human disease no one animal model fully reflects sars or mers therefore researchers are faced with exploring several small animal models or choosing the best-fit model to date animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease thus animal models of mers and sars need further refinement many small animal models have been evaluated as potential mers and sars models including mice hamsters and ferrets for mers and syrian hamsters and guinea pigs for sars 217219 four murine models have been reported for mers the first model that demonstrated promise involved transduction of the respiratory tract with the putative mers-cov receptor human dpp4 or cd26 220 the major indicator of disease in this model is viral load in the lung at 4 days post-inoculation although clinical signs of disease including weight loss were limited in this model it has been used for pathogenesis countermeasure studies 221 222 lethal disseminated mers infection has been demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing human dpp4 223 inflammatory processes were observed in the brains of these mice in contrast to human disease in which cns involvement has not been reported a transgenic mouse mers model was developed in which the mouse dpp4 gene was replaced by the human dpp4 gene under control of the endogenous mouse dpp4 promoter using this model mers-cov-infected mice developed lung pathology 194 in addition administration of human monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein in these transgenic mice provided protection against mers-cov infection 194 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-crispr-associated protein 9 crispr-cas9 gene editing technology was used to modify the mouse dpp4 to match human dpp4 by altering amino acids at positions 288 and 330 interestingly wild type virus infection of these mice did not result in an improved model of mers however serial passage of mers-cov resulted in mers-cov-15 intranasal exposure of mers-cov-15 in 288330 mice led to weight loss and a severe respiratory disease that included ards-like signs and reduced pulmonary function 224 mers-cov infection of rabbits has also been evaluated as a model for mers haagmans et al 225 demonstrated that mers-cov infected rabbits did not develop obvious clinical signs but infectious virus could be detected in the upper respiratory tract 225 furthermore epithelial cells of the bronchioles and terminal bronchioles respiratory tract were positive for mers-cov by immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization which reflects tissue tropism in human disease 225 using the rabbit model houser et al 191 demonstrated that human monoclonal antibody 336 given pre-exposure reduced viral rna lung titer at 3 days post-exposure but not when given post-exposure 191 due to phylogenetic similarities with humans nhp models of disease have long been considered as necessary for evaluation of countermeasures to infectious diseases rhesus monkey and common marmoset have been evaluated as potential models for mers following intratracheal instillation of mers-cov in rhesus monkey models lung pathology was observed 122 226228 experiments using rhesus monkeys have indicated that they develop limited systemic disease and a transient respiratory disease radiologic evaluations have indicated inflammatory infiltrates that develop shortly after exposure analysis of lung tissues by reverse transcriptase- quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated virus replication in the lung similar to mers african green monkeys agms rhesus monkeys cynomolgus monkeys and common marmosets have been identified as potential models for sars 229 smits et al 230 compared sars cov infection in young agms to cynomolgus monkeys they observed that neither species developed clinical signs during a 4-day experiment 230 gross pathology indicated multi-focal pulmonary consolidation with consolidated grey-red firm lungs these lesions affected 30 of the lungs in one subject by comparison the cynomolgus monkeys developed small patchy macroscopic lesions similar to mers-cov infection of nhps viral load decreases from exposure day to day 4 a comparison between agms rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus monkeys further support agms as the best available nhp model for sars 231 agms developed the highest viral load and most disease when compared to cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys lethal disease was not observed in any of these species therefore further development of the sars model is warranted since lethal respiratory tract disease was the hallmark of sars as an alternative to old world nhps many groups have employed marmosets as models of human infectious disease 232234 common marmosets have been evaluated as a mers model 121 122 235 these studies have demonstrated that common marmosets develop disease following exposure to mers-cov as shown by histopathological analysis radiological analysis and rt-qpcr however variable results have been reported and exposure methodology can impact disease progression therefore mock-infected groups must be included to account for pathological artifacts the virus-specific pathology could be quantified using computed tomography and future experiments using large group sizes could be used for countermeasure evaluation greenough et al 236 performed a serial euthanasia study of sars-cov infected marmosets 236 subjects were intratracheally exposed with sars-cov they observed mild inconsistent clinical signs of disease viral loads peaked at day 4 post-infection histopathology indicated interstitial pneumonitis with multinucleated syncytia that were described as mild and not observed in all late time-point subjects overall further research is needed to develop animal models of sars that reflect human disease presentation drugs with repurposing potential discussed here table 3 have the advantage of easy access availability and decreased cost of development and provide a wide array of options for combination studies the pharmacological knowledge available for such compounds may also reduce concerns regarding adverse effects in patients the generation of a translational database encompassing pharmacodynamics data and infectious disease biology data has been proposed and would greatly facilitate decision making to pursue new drug combinations 237 many of the drugs have potential for broad-spectrum antiviral activity and have already been in clinical use for treating other viral infections as novel drugs in development move from the pre-clinical to clinical phase they also become available for combination therapy care should be taken with the pharmacological evaluation of each combination to avoid possible contraindications of the drugs with regards to disease or adverse effects novel broad-spectrum replication inhibitors such as gs-5734 gilead sciences in phase i clinical trial immunomodulators nitazoxanide steroids statins along with direct-acting antiviral agents for coronaviruses that are in development represent interesting partners for combinations combinations can involve broad-spectrum versus specific antiviral agents drugs with different mechanism of action or drugs that target different steps of the viral life cycle identifying one or more potent combinations with activity in an animal model would greatly increase preparedness for the next coronavirus outbreak elucidation of the crystal structure of viral proteins has led to novel approaches for rational drug design rational design investigations using protein structure information and in silico screening for affinity to active sites of viral proteins holds promise hiv-1 protease inhibitors have been one of the big successes of rational drug design only 6 years after the publication of the hiv-1 protease structure saquinavir was developed in record time from bench to bedside and was licensed for use against aids in 1995 238240 in total six antivirals against the hiv-1 protease were designed and approved between 1995 and 2000 similarly for hcv computeraided approaches based on the known crystal structure of a viral protein have successfully guided the design and synthesis of inhibitors for the hcv ns3ns4a proteases such as the peptidomimetics telaprevir and boceprivir 241243 due to the power of computational modeling using crystal structures from known coronaviruses the crystal structures for the viral proteases mpro and plpro of sars-cov and mers-cov were determined relatively quickly 244 these structures have already been used for the discovery of inhibitors with high binding affinity to the active site of the proteases the structures of additional mers-cov or sars-cov viral proteins have yet to be determined and would offer additional viral targets for drug discovery structural design can help with development of inhibitors in preparing for future outbreaks of yet unknown emerging coronaviruses based on the potential of zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses from bats to humans crystal structures for the main protease mpro of different bat coronavirus families have been proposed for screening and identifying broad-spectrum antiviral agents 244 proof-of-principle was shown for the novel protease inhibitor sg85 which inhibits the bat coronavirus hku4 244 in 2012 sg85 was quickly identified as an inhibitor of mers-cov through in silico docking studies with the mpro of mers-cov and the bat coronavirus hku4 several drugs eg toremifene citrate terconazole fig 3 belong to a group of compounds termed cationic amphiphilic drugs cads 100 151 152 154 245 phenothiazines eg fluphenazine chlorpromazine fig 3 are cads that have been shown to inhibit hcv entry at virus-host cell fusion by intercalating into the cholesterol-rich domains of the host cell membrane and increasing membrane fluidity 97 drugs that act through this mechanism may present an interesting new class of broad-spectrum antivirals cads are known to be lysomotropic and accumulate in acidic compartments where their tertiary amine groups are protonated the compounds act as mild bases and can neutralize the low ph of the acidic environment of endolysosomes cads can intercalate into membranes alter the biophysical properties of membranes and thereby could potentially interfere with fusion of virus with the endolysosomal membrane the concept of interfering with virus entry and budding through physicochemical properties of drugs is intriguing many viruses would be susceptible to this type of inhibition and cads could be used as broad-spectrum antiviral agents detailed structure-activity relationship studies on cads will be required to determine the chemical core structures and physicochemical properties important for this type of antiviral agent future investigations regarding the conservation of this mechanism of action to coronaviruses as well as other emerging viruses are warranted approved drugs with activity against mers-cov or sars-cov could be used as lead compounds for further antiviral drug development pharmaceuticals usually have undergone multiple rounds of structure-activity relationship studies generating analogs to improve drug activity against the original indication or target the analogs of drugs with activity against mers-cov and sars-cov may still be available and could be screened to identify other analogs with increased antiviral activity although drug analogs would have to go through the full licensure process there would be little to no added initial cost associated with producing the structure-activity relationship compounds recycling old analogs is one approach that may have value for developing novel drugs for viral infections a more streamlined process is needed for development of effective treatment measures for emerging and re-emerging pathogens the availability of a panel of approved broad-spectrum drugs would clearly be beneficial as they could be used for treating disease symptoms and reducing morbidity until more specific acting antivirals and vaccines are developed a large number of potential drugs and therapeutics for the treatment of mers and sars have been discussed the greatest challenge will be how best to down-select and evaluate the different approaches as we have learned from drug development for aids and hepatitis alleviating disease symptoms and increasing life span may be a more achievable goal rather than looking for a treatment that will provide complete recovery broad-spectrum antivirals specific antivirals and immune modulators each have an important role in treating viral infections either individually or in combination effective communication between the different institute partners government industry academic national and international partners is essential combining these drug discovery efforts will increase the chance of having one or more potential therapeutic agents at an advanced development stage by the time another outbreak of an emerging coronavirus occurs  dj vu stimulating open drug discovery for sars-cov-2 sean ekins melina mottin paulo ramos rps bruna sousa kp bruno neves junior daniel foil h kimberley zorn m rodolpho braga c megan coffee christopher southan ana puhl c carolina andrade horta   the two major ebola virus outbreaks in africa 1 the zika virus in brazil 2 and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3 which was declared by the world health organization who as a pandemic 4 5 have all occurred in the past decade in each case there is a strong sense of dj vu for those scientists involved in drug discovery a lack of available antivirals to treat the infected patients leads to a clamoring to test anything available and some pharmaceutical companies charge in to offer their drugs we also seem to see similar patterns in response across outbreaks there is a rush to be first and this sense of priority might not lead to the best or even any outcome for patients always there is the immediate proposal to create a vaccine and pronouncements that this will be available in a short time or by the end of the year of the actual outbreak in question and it never happens within these optimistic artificial deadlines again we have experienced this with the current outbreak for ebola the vaccine was ready for the second outbreak and has now been approved 6 governments are out to calm their populations while at the same time needing to be seen to do something that will vanquish the virus in the case of sars-cov-2 it results in pneumonia 7 and shares aspects of pathology and pathogenesis with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 8 sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the same family coronaviridae and genus betacoronavirus several drug companies immediately made their antivirals available for example abbvie made their hiv approved drug lopinavirritonavir combination available to the chinese government 9 this drug had previously been suggested as promising based on combination study results from a marmoset study 10 publications have already appeared describing the use of this drug in a patient in korea significantly decreasing the viral load 11 simultaneously gilead made available remdesivir which had previously failed in clinical trials for ebola 12 but had recently shown activity against mers in rhesus macaques 13 remdesivir chloroquine and several other drugs were tested in vitro against sars-cov-2 table 1
 and shown to be active 14 some researchers had also suggested as early as january 2020 what treatment options might be most likely and these included lopinavirritonavir remdesivir favilavir arbidol as well as a broad array of nucleoside analogs neuraminidase inhibitors peptides rna synthesis inhibitors anti-inflammatory drugs and traditional chinese medicines 15 16 17 the need for other treatment options will be important as we learn more about its transmission 18 and as we see increases in the number of travel-related infections 19 already in the past weeks we have seen the rapid spread to italy and from there to many other countries including brazil and beyond such virus outbreaks are greatly straining the healthcare systems of affected countries and will test every aspect of our infrastructure supply chains and preparedness 20 this raises the question of what we can learn from our past drug discovery efforts in an attempt to develop additional drugs for sars-cov-2 more efficiently the acceleration of global sars-cov-2 data generation effectively just in a couple of months has been remarkable however scientific information gaps that impede progress toward small-molecule treatments can still be perceived many of these persist from when they were first outlined for ebola back in 2015 21 we can thus make some then-and-now comparisons see supplementary material figs s1s4 and table s1 online as well as share our own experiences of research on these virus outbreaks our efforts in ebola drug discovery initially started in 2014 with a computational pharmacophore analysis of a small number of in vitro ebola active compounds 22 this was followed by identifying and summarizing all the fda-approved drugs that could be used against the virus 23 24 and highlighting various strategies for the next virus outbreak 21 these steps preceded a pivotal point for us in developing machine learning models for the ebola virus derived from in vitro data 25 26 an early drug 22 identified by these screens was the antimalarial amodiaquine which was subsequently shown to be associated with decreased mortality 27 as the drug artesunateamodiaquine was used for malaria treatment in some ebola patients whereas others took a different malaria medicine artemetherlumefantrine 27 our ebola machine learning models were used to select three molecules for in vitro testing 28 we identified pyronaridine tilorone and quinacrine as having good in vitro activity nm against the ebola virus 28 these preliminary data enabled us to obtain funding from the nih to take one of the compounds through in vivo testing we also leveraged nih support to a collaborator to test the other two compounds as well these molecules were then each tested in the mouse model for ebola infection and demonstrated significant efficacy 29 30 31 pyronaridine is currently being pursued in larger animal models of ebola virus infection working on computational models through to in vitro testing happened in the space of a few months whereas it took several years to obtain funding for our first mouse studies this is by no means a streamlined approach to drug discovery but it was cost effective for the amount of data ultimately generated and led to revitalized interest in these molecules in 2016 we pulled together a team of researchers in brazil and the usa to provide some suggestions for an open drug discovery effort for the zika virus these included various computational strategies to repurpose molecules and docking into the zika proteins 32 we also described resources and molecules that could be prioritized for testing this was followed by our homology modeling of every zika virus protein 33 weeks before the first crystal structures for zika proteins were released all of this work was performed in the open and it attracted the attention of the ibm world community grid team who requested we submit a proposal to them for a zika project using their distributed computing facilities this became the openzika project led by our team in brazil and the usa and it involved the docking of millions of molecules from the zinc database in all zika virus and related flavivirus protein crystal structures 34 we have since also performed further modeling of zika proteins 35 and an analysis of the first 2 years following the outbreak 36 our most recent efforts have led to the discovery of an inhibitor for ns3 helicase 37 what we can learn from the openzika project to streamline future open science projects would be as follows we would pick fewer targets to dock molecules into as the openzika project created billions of docking results for tens of targets that will take many years to process we would also suggest that it is best to work with high-resolution crystal structures versus homology models as soon as possible we would also start with a library of commercially available drugs and antivirals this would massively limit the number of molecules docked to a few thousand because we found that docking of the zinc library available at that time led to compounds that were not readily available focused libraries are interesting options to perform target-directed virtual screening examples are chemdiv 38 and asinex 39 databases which have specific subsets for protease inhibitors for example facilitating and accelerating the experimental screening during openzika we learnt that having multiple biology labs committed to doing testing in vitro is also very important to have access to experimental results more quickly to validate the computational approach working with the ibm world community grid did not include any funding we found it very difficult to obtain nih funding to support this project from the very beginning because it was computational and also attempted small business grants with academic collaborators without success even though we were leveraging massive computational resources through the world community grid we would recommend that open efforts like this need some funding for in vitro validation millions of dollars have been invested by the nih to fund other zika research projects since the 2016 outbreak and there is as yet no small molecule of note in the drug discovery pipeline 36 there is still therefore an unmet medical need for treatments for zika virus and computational efforts could aid this and be cost-effective the whole genome sequences for sars-cov-2 were isolated from patients from several countries such as brazil canada china germany korea and usa and were made rapidly available at the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gsaid platform 40 there were 135 genomes sampled between december 2019 and february 2020 the samples were found to be closely related with few mutations relative to a common ancestor preliminary genetic analysis indicates that the brazilian genome differs by three mutations to the wuhan reference strain 41 two of these mutations are shared with its closest sequencethe germany strain 41 in the space of a few weeks after the acknowledgement of the latest coronavirus outbreak several laboratories started to deposit homology models for the main viral protease 42 43 and then for all the sars-cov-2 proteins using the server i-tasser 44 others performed docking in these models 45 or developed their own models to understand how the virus enters cells by modeling the spike s protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein interaction 46 at the time of writing there were structures available for the sars-cov-2 main protease in complex with an inhibitor n3 pdb id 6lu7 47 and s1 and s2 subunits of spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain up 6vsb the post fusion core subunit 6lxt and the hr2 domain 6lvn 48 49 a useful overview is provided by searching the entire virus sequence against the protein data bank pdb see supplementary material fig s2 online in comparison for zika it took several months from the beginning of the outbreak until there was a single protein available in the pdb 50 the spike glycoprotein is responsible for the fusion of the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane during virus maturation it is cleaved to its subunits s1 which attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with the host receptor and s2 which mediates the fusion of the virion and cellular membranes a recent study reports that sars-cov-2 spike protein binds ace2 with higher affinity than sars-cov 48 because there was only one cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein with low resolution 346  without the human ace2 protein 48 at the time of writing this paper we preferred to build a model by homology modeling see supplementary material methods online using our sars-cov-2 spike protein model and the available sars-cov spike protein crystal structure pdb 2ajf we aligned both structures to compare the residues in the spikeace2 interface residues for both viruses as can be seen in fig 1
 the residues for sars-cov are asn473 tyr475 tyr440 tyr436 tyr484 leu472 tyr442 and asn479 and for sars-cov-2 are asn167 tyr169 tyr133 tyr129 gln178 phe166 leu135 and gln173 moreover some sars-cov-2 residues such as gln178 phe166 leu135 and gln173 are not conserved but have the same physicalchemical features except the residues sars-cov-2 gln178 polar and sars tyr484 hydrophobic fig 1 the main protease mpro of coronaviruses is a cysteine protease that participates in the viral replication cleaving the polyprotein mpro is organized into three domains and is active in a homodimer form 51 we aligned the crystal structures of mpro of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 to compare the structures and the residues of the catalytic site the catalytic site for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are the same his41cys145 52 whereas for mers-cov it is his41cys148 52 fig 2
 this catalytic site is localized between the interface of domain i residues 8101 and ii 102184 the third domain residues 201303 is c-terminal and consists of a loop region required for the dimerization 53 54 55 56 recently it has been reported that the structures of mpro of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have high identity of 96 43 the function and the structural equivalence of mpro of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 demonstrate that the coronavirus proteases are promising targets for development of broad-spectrum antivirals in these viruses drug repurposing offers a potentially faster approach to identify drugs that are already approved for other uses and might work for the disease of interest 57 58 59 this type of strategy was attempted for mers-cov and sars-cov 60 61 and the repurposing of host-based therapies has also been proposed for coronaviruses 62 several studies have screened a few hundred molecules and tested the activity against mers-cov and sars-cov table 2
 63 64 the first screen of 348 fda-approved drugs identified four fda-approved drugs including chloroquine chlorpromazine loperamide and lopinavir 63 at the same time a second study screened 290 compounds and identified 27 fda- and non-fda-approved drugs including chloroquine among the many hits 64 and the abl2 kinase inhibitors such as imatinib which impacts the early stages of infection after internalization and endosomal trafficking this latter molecule appears to work by inhibiting fusion at the viral membrane 65 chloroquine is widely used for malaria and loperamide is used for diarrhea these represent drugs that are readily available in many locations around the world and for which physicians are also familiar with the side-effect profile the ligand datasets from these and other screens can be used to apply machine learning methods to produce predictive models that can then be used to screen compound libraries and suggest new compounds to test as an example we have developed several models for ace2 sars-cov and mers-cov using our assay central software 66 67 68 69 which uses ecfp6 descriptors and the bayesian algorithm fig 3
 the experimental details are described in the supplementary material online the bayesian models are also available at httpmodelscollabchemcom8 the advantage of this approach is that the method is fast does not require crystal structures and it enables small-molecule structures to be scored against many models simultaneously as a well-established principle any sars-cov-2 relevant enzyme assay proteinprotein interaction antagonism or viral infectivity determination can be run against a collection of approved drugs however it is neither trivial to get a definitive list of these structures in silico prepared for docking or to acquire these as a physical collection ready for screening even though there are various repurposing subsets available from vendors notwithstanding an approximation to a definitive approved set can be selected in pubchem as the intersect between curated drug resources such as drugbank drugcentral and the iupharbps guide to pharmacology with totals of 9135 4012 and 7674 molecules respectively the three-way compounds-in-common total is 1119 chemical identifiers cid pubchem indicates that 1197 molecules are available from chemical vendors relaxing the stringency of the repurposing provides triage steps that can certainly be useful for docking andor machine learning or other modeling efforts in this case the union of all three drug curation sources is 16468 other drug-centric solutions include the selection of 9527 international non-proprietary names inn cid the majority of these will have either been progressed to phase i testing or are close to it an alternative to screening every approved drug is to take one class of compounds for example we have now taken the opportunity to dock fda-approved hiv-1 protease inhibitors amprenavir atazanavir darunavir fosamprenavir indinavir lopinavir nelfinavir ritonavir saquinavir and tipranavir and hepatitis c ns34a protease inhibitors asunaprevir boceprevir grazoprevir paritaprevir simeprevir and telaprevir into the mpro structure of sars-cov-2 the docking was performed with two different commercial docking software products biovia discovery studio and schrdinger glide 70 71 72 73 and the best docking results were compared see supplementary material table s2 online the results of both docking approaches indicated that azatanavir and lopinavir could be of most interest for in vitro or in vivo testing fig 4
 atazanavir can interact with mpro by h-bonding at cys145 and the amide group the aromatic ring of atazanavir ligandfit score of 191196 also formed hydrophobic interactions with residues cys44 met49 leu50 tyr54 and cys145 in relation to lopinavir ligandfit score of 175497 h-bonds were established between residues cys145 and glu166 and nitrogen atoms of carbamate groups similar hydrophobic interactions were observed with lopinavir fig 4 in china and south korea lopinavir 200 mgritonavir 50 mg has already been used for the treatment of covid-19 from the day after lopinavirritonavir administration the viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then 11 lopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir is commercially available and known as kaletra around the worldit is on formularies for hiv by contrast atazanavir is less commonly used kaletra can be widely produced and distributed quickly through existing channels but it will be important to ensure hiv patients do not lose access to the medications they need it is also a medication that clinicians are familiar with in terms of side effects unlike other less commonly used medications a broader analysis of all fda-approved drugs docked in this protease structure could point to further drugs worth testing we have also performed docking calculations of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein complexed with the host ace2 protein against all fda-approved drugs 2400 molecules using schrdinger glide software 70 71 72 73 because there was only one cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein with low resolution 346  without the human ace2 protein 48 at the time of doing this analysis we preferred to build a model by homology modeling because lower-resolution structures 3  or higher show the basic contours of the protein chain and the atomic structure must be inferred we built the sars-cov-2 spike subunit s1 model using the swissmodel server 74 the template used was the sars-cov spike s1 protein pdb id 2ghv 75 which has resolution of 22  and 7322 of sequence identity with sars-cov-2 spike protein after the protein refinement we added the human ace2 protein to the model based on the sars-cov spikeace2 structure pdb id 2ajf 76 and built the full sars-cov-2 spike s1ace2 model see fig s5 in supplementary material online the quality statistics of the modeled sars-cov-2 spikeace2 were good 9653 of the residues lie in the most favorable regions of the ramachandran plot and the molprobity score was 166 our sars-cov-2 spikeace2 model is available see supplemental material pdb file online subsequently we performed docking-based virtual screening with a grid centered at the spikeace2 interface as can be seen in table 3
 docking scores indicated that rizatriptan an antimigraine agent glide score  749 kcal mol1 dasabuvir an antiviral for hepatitis c glide score  792 kcal mol1 pravastatin a lipid-lowering agent glide score  781 kcal mol1 and empagliflozin a hypoglycemic agent glide score  709 kcal mol1 could be of interest for in vitro testing details of intermolecular interactions of these drugs with the interface of spikeace2 are shown in fig 5
 in summary these drugs form -cation interactions with lys31a  interactions with phe170b and h-bonds with his34a asp38a gly176b and ser174b in good agreement with our results a previous study suggests that an early and high dose of a statin such as pravastatin could be crucial to surviving mers-cov infection 77 these suggested molecules could be validated in future in vitro experiments modern drug discovery efforts try to eliminate inefficiency by increasing knowledge through extensive utilization of generated data to guide new experiments therefore we have also taken a drug repurposing approach based on polypharmacology using a method called the molecular and biological signature 78 this is a profiling approach guided by artificial intelligence capable of presenting the complex relationships between the chemical substance with molecular targets cells andor organs this could create a more complete understanding of the multi-biological profile caused by the drug analyzed in response to a disease as an example we have applied the drugs ritonavir 9 favipiravir ribavirin and chloroquine as scaffolds to find new potential molecular and biological signature profiles to search for non-obvious mechanism-of-action-based associations between drugs molecular targets and diseases fig 6
 and supplementary material fig s6 and table s3 online comparing the molecular and biological signature of ritonavir with other drugs we found that the drugs cobicistat carfilzomib and ombitasvir presented the highest matching scores 8171 suggesting that those drugs could be of further interest for sars-cov-2 although there are already several drugs being assessed clinically for sars-cov-2 there is still a need to identify additional treatments as alternatives to offset drug shortages and possibly discover molecules with increased efficacy safety and cost-effectiveness we have previously proposed and applied computational drug discovery approaches such as machine learning and docking to aid in the discovery of new candidate molecules for ebola and zika respectively what we have learnt in these efforts can be applied to sars-cov-2 as we have demonstrated here however the research in this case has moved at a much faster pace initially delivering a first crystal structure in just a few weeks after first public notification of the virus companies have mobilized to bring their drugs to patients and clinicians have used prior in vitro research that proposed compounds active against mers-cov and sars-cov to suggest treatments for sars-cov-2 we currently do not clinically use any broad-spectrum antivirals in the usa but they would be invaluable in situations like this for sars-cov-2 and other viruses identifying medications with side-effect profiles known by clinicians that are already produced at scale and available at local pharmacies around the world will allow more patients to be treated especially as travel restrictions and quarantines could reduce production and distribution of certain drugs it will remain important that those who need these medications at baseline such as hiv patients who take ritonavirlopinavir are able to continue to access the medications they need or else there is a risk of poor clinical outcomes and antiviral resistance in these patients although other viruses such as the flu might have killed more patients in the usa this season so far the crippling financial impact of sars-cov-2 remains to be seen globally if past ebola zikv mers-cov and sars-cov outbreaks are anything to go by this sars-cov-2 pandemic will be far more significant having multiple effective treatments available for sars-cov-2 that can be rapidly delivered to patients could save lives we can also supplement these treatments by a combination of computational screening with machine learning and docking to select additional drugs to test as proposed herein and this can be repeated for future virus outbreaks the sense of dj vu will probably be repeated again and again with the next virus outbreaks until we develop broader-spectrum antivirals each time we hope to be better prepared hope however does not save lives effective antiviral treatments do and we need to have them ready in the future se is founder and

victoria fasiku oluwaseun irene mackraj thirumala govender   in december 2019 patients in wuhan china started experiencing a disease with acute respiratory attacks investigations revealed that the disease was due to a novel virus that was later designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the disease was assigned as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and its global spread has led to the world health organization who declaring it as a global pandemic yuen et al 2020 sars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirus family which has threatened the lives and health of millions of people around the world as per the who situational report 143 on covid-19 the number of infection cases globally were over 7273958 the number of deaths is increasing exponentially with over 413372 worldwide thus far who 2020bwho 2020ba who 2020bb d coronaviruses are single stranded positive sense rna viruses with genome sizes of between 28 and 32 kb these viruses have the ability to infect both animals and humans they cause an array of diseases including and not limited to respiratory neurologic hepatic and gastrointestinal disease su et al 2016 based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structure the novel virus belongs to the genera betacoronavirus which has a close similarity to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses sarsr-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov importantly the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 and its replication cycle has been elucidated and together with our evolving understanding of the host immune response these factors have been the basis for investigating diagnostic and prognostic testing epidemiologic tracking and the initiation of therapeutic strategies wang et al 2020a wu et al 2020a the threat of the virus has reached unimaginable proportions and has exposed the unpreparedness of national healthcare systems and has triggered international solidarity despite covid-19 being declared a global pandemic by who no drug regimen has been shown to be effective in the treatment of the virus moreover numerous completed randomized clinical trials have not produced clear guidelines on treatment options and prophylactic therapy yet currently several active clinical trials for treatment are ongoing other emerging non-conventional drug discovery techniques provides alternative faster and less costly routes to discovering potent anti-sars-cov2 drugs furthermore while drugs are being repurposed and discovered for covid-19 novel drug delivery systems will play a paramount role in designing efficient delivery systems that have virus targeting ability improved pharmacokinetic profiles and avoidance of possible drug resistance leading to superior therapies this review summarizes proposed drug targets for therapy and reviews the various clinical trials that have been reported as well as vaccines that are under development it also highlights emerging therapies and future perspectives for the treatment and prevention of covid-19 an understanding of the host response is crucial to implement valid therapeutic strategies as stated previously and it is now apparent that severity of the disease is dependent on both the virus itself and host response host response to sars-cov-2 has been described in the literature however key aspects are still being elucidated notably symptoms of patients range from minimal to severe respiratory failure with multiple organ failure complicating linking pathophysiology with symptoms in a complete picture hence we can report on key findings in each aspect to date berlin et al 2020 magro et al 2020 tay et al 2020 importantly sars-cov-2 is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets with a possible but unproven faecaloral transmission route tay et al 2020 the median incubation period is approximately 45 days before symptom onset with 975 of symptomatic patients developing symptoms within 115 days lauer et al 2020 the most common symptoms of covid -19 are reported to be fever cough fatigue anorexia myalgia and diarrhea cdc guidelines backer et al 2020 cdc 2020 dyspnoea often accompanied by hypoxemia is a common symptom of severe illness wang et al 2020d zhou et al 2020a which may progress to ards other manifestations of severe covid-19 are lymphopenia disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system acute cardiac kidney and liver injury in addition to cardiac arrhythmias rhabdomyolysis coagulopathy and shock berlin et al 2020 notably sars-cov-2 viral load reaches its peak within 56 days of symptom onset and severe covid-19 cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards on average around 89 days after symptom onset tay et al 2020 a timeline for symptoms of the severe disease is described by berlin et al 2020 the virus enters the cells via ace 2 is internalized as described above and triggers a series of events intracellularly leading to disease manifestation based on the targeting of key regulatory pathways cells and organs however the main target is the respiratory tree and lung tissue and therefore this will be described in more detail notably the characteristic pulmonary ground glass opacification is seen even in asymptomatic patients mason 2020 based on the cells that are likely infected covid-19 can be divided into three phases that correspond to different clinical stages of the disease mason 2020 covid-19 confined to the conducting airways should be mild and treated symptomatically at home when it has progressed to the gas exchange units of the lung it must be monitored carefully with the best support mason 2020 
tay et al 2020 describes the chronology of events upon cell entry describing interaction of sars-cov-2 with the immune system leading to either a normal healthy response or a dysfunctional immune response ir in brief the virus enters the cell which has both ace2 and tmprrss2 and replicates leading to more viral release thereafter the cell undergoes pyroptosis and releases damage-associated molecular patterns damps this triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il-6 ip-10 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 mip1 mip1 and mcp1 other immune cells are attracted to the site viz monocytes macrophages and t cells which produce a proinflammatory loop this can lead to viral clearance and minimal lung damage healthy immune response or a series of events which can culminate in multi-organ damage dysfunctional immune response tay et al 2020 an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in cytokine storm damages the lung structure and leads to multi-organ damage as it spreads to other parts of the body the cytokine release syndrome crs or storm is characterized by multiorgan pathology and fever lin et al 2020 importantly non-neutralizing antibodies may further exacerbate organ damage however in a healthy immune response the initial inflammation attracts the following t cells to the site of infection antibodies neutralizing which can block viral infection and alveolar macrophages which phagocytise neutralized viruses and apoptotic cells this contributes to viral clearance minimal lung damage and recovery tay et al 2020 the symptoms and pathogenesis are similar to those of sars-cov and mers-cov infections rockx et al 2020 this has helped in understanding of the disease despite a lack of knowledge on sars-cov-2 data attained based upon the first cases in wuhan china indicate that the incubation time is generally between 2 and 7 days however the longest incubation time was seen to be 125 days backer et al 2020 yuen et al 2020 however data from the united states of america has shown some patients have up to 17 days of incubation lauer et al 2020 based on the life cycle transduction and signaling process of the virus as well as patient responses various targets can be exploited to combat the virus the following section describes the specific targets and highlights the drugs being investigated to exploit them for overcoming viral infection it also describes the possible targets which can be explored to create vaccines against the virus by understanding cellular factors that aid the entry and fusion of the sars-cov-2 virus it has provided therapeutic targets for drug development against the virus the virus has been reported to use the serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming and binding to ace2 for cellular entry a tmprss2 inhibitor can block viral entry constituting a treatment option hoffmann et al 2020b computational methods on repurposing existing candidates have revealed candidate inhibitors for tmprss2 rensi et al 2020 amongst these camostat mesylate a clinically proven inhibitor of tmprss2 was used in japan to treat unrelated diseases zhang et al 2020b it has been associated with reduced lung cell line infection with sars-cov-19 and could therefore be used as a therapeutic option in the management of covid-19 hoffmann et al 2020a sars-cov-2 has utilized protein-mediated cell-viral fusion as an entry mechanism into the cell providing another potential drug target for management of the sars-cov-2 zhu et al 2020 hence another option may be to target ap-2 associated protein kinase 1 aak1 it is a host kinase that is involved in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis yang and shen 2020 based upon artificial intelligence subsets of approved drugs were evaluated the janus kinase jak inhibitor baricitinib is a suitable candidate to inhibit aaki favalli et al 2020 marotto and sarzi-puttini 2020 it demonstrates antiviral as well as anti-inflammatory activity richardson et al 2020a in addition peptides such as the hr2 derived peptides can be potential drug targets for covid-19 as they could inhibit viral entry angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and sars-cov-2 interactions suggest that antihypertensive drugs acei and arbs may reduce the risk and severity of covid-19 as mentioned previously sars-cov-2 exploits ace2 as a co-receptor to gain entry into susceptible cells via the transmembrane spike s glycoprotein and cleavage activates the viral protein for membrane fusion via extensive irreversible conformational changes walls et al 2020 the involvement of raas in attachment makes the system a drug target for management of covid-19 and has raised debates on the benefits and downsides associated with aceiarbs rico-mesa et al 2020 vaduganathan et al 2020 also since ace2 is used for viral entry it has raised concerns on its impact on other components of raas the debates concern firstly a purported upregulation in ace2 due to acei use since their mechanism of action ultimately leads to decreased ang ii the main effector octapeptide of raas the same would apply to arbs this would then predispose the patient to infection due to increased ace2 however a review by vaduganathan et al 2020 reports that animal studies using arbs and acei are found to be inconclusive and not enough data is available to support translation to humans vaduganathan et al 2020 secondly it is contended that since the function of ace2 is to convert ang ii to ang 17 if it is unavailabledownregulated due to viral binding this would then lead to increased ang ii which could then impact on lung pathology this would also lead to lower ang 17 levels notably aceiarbs would then be expected to ameliorate the resultant pathology since it reduces ang ii levels or action the role of ang ii was postulated because of studies for example in patients with covid-19 who appeared to have elevated levels of plasma angiotensin ii which correlated with total viral load and degree of lung injury li et al 2020a the connection between at1ang ii and lung pathology is reinforced by others kai and kai 2020 however others found that restoration of ace2 through the administration of recombinant ace2 appeared to reverse lung-injury in preclinical models of other viral infections gu et al 2016 zou et al 2014 multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trials rcts are currently being conducted to investigate the effects of losartan on mortality and hospital admission in covid-19 patients kai and kai 2020 
vaduganathan et al 2020 do not recommend withdrawal of the drugs by patients of heart failure and myocardial infarction importantly they recommend that until further data are available raas modulators should be continued in patients in an otherwise stable condition who are at risk for being evaluated for or with covid-19 vaduganathan et al 2020 it is clear that more research needs to be conducted into the impact of ace 2 on infectivity within this context the role at ang ii on lung pathology and role of aceiarbs in covid given the complexity of raas from a systemic and tissue specific perspective in addition acei is known to potentiate the vasodilator bradykinin bk roche et al 2020 used established and emerging evidence to propose a testable hypothesis that a vicious positive feedback loop involving dysregulated bk signaling is involved in inflammation which likely responsible for the severe respiratory complications in covid-19 hence they propose the fda-approved molecule icatibant that might be able to interrupt this feedback loop and thereby improve the clinical outcomes roche and roche 2020 it is widely reported that the host cellular entry involves the endocytic pathway and non-endosomal pathway inhibition of the pathway could be a strategy to inhibit the viral entry and infection mechanism of the drug targets could include drugs that have the ability to penetrate the lysosomes accumulating inside and neutralizing the acidic ph of endosomes and lysosome such targets could inhibit the viral entry the second possible mechanism involves protease inhibitors targeting clathrin-mediated endocytosis zhu et al 2020 zumla et al 2016 these targets could play an important role in developing novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of covid-19 multiple antiviral agents are developed in order to disrupt viral replication such as dna methyltransferase mtases polymerases and other entry proteins currently the antiviral with the most potential is remdesivir mahase 2020 it is a synthetic molecule which targets rna synthesis since it acts as an analogue of a dna nucleoside adenosine remdesivir is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine-triphosphate for the incorporation into viral rna strands once it gets incorporated into the viral rna at position i it terminates rna synthesis the anti-viral effects have also been investigated in the rhesus macaque which was infected with mers-cov smith and prosser 2020a beta coronavirus have the ability to infect immune cells such as monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in the activation and secretion of il-6 and other cytokines that have proinflammatory properties severe form of covid-19 disease is characterized by fever and pneumonia that further develops to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards elevation of serum concentrations interleukin-6 il-6 and other inflammatory cytokines results in crs that induces ards a hallmark of sars-cov2 infections developing effective il-6 antagonists inhibits the cytokine-driven hyperinflammatory syndrome for the management of covid-19 moore and june 2020 various parasitic drugs are being investigated at different stages of study for combating sars-cov-2 in a recent study ivermectin which is known to inhibit the in vitro replication of several positive stranded rna viruses such as dengue zika chikungunya and yellow fever could be a potential treatment options for covid-19 leon et al 2020 in vitro data shows 50 inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication after 48 h incubation with vero cells at 28 mml equivalent to a plasma concentration of 2100 mgml a concentration of 50-fold less than the concentration of ivermectin proven to reduce viral replication by half this antiviral activity may lead to carefully conducted controlled trials however ivermectin can cross into the brain and react with gaba-gated chlorine channels causing neurotoxicity this is usually prevented by the blood brain barrier bbb particularly by the p-glycoprotein p-gp hence ivermectin may not be considered a safe drug if the bbb is compromised in the inflammatory state hy et al 1990 due to the leaky bbb caused by sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020b the use of ivermectin in severely ill patients should be administered with caution interestingly if ivermectin is used in combination with other drugs such as ritonavir which is a very good cyp3a4 inhibitor with some effect on the p-gp as well li et al 2019 this can boost ivermectin concentration increasing cmax and causing further toxicity by crossing the bbb leading to accumulation in the brain edwards 2003 kennedy et al 2014 chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq are antiplasmodium drugs approved for malaria treatment they are also a part of the model list of essential medicines declared by who who 2017 cq and hcq antiviral activity is attributed to their ability to elevate the ph of acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes that are known to be essential for viral-host cell membrane fusion the second mode of action of cq has been reported to be via the change of glycosylation of ace2 receptor and spike protein liu et al 2020b chloroquine is currently under intense investigation albeit controversial as a potential covid-19 treatment wang et al 2020b several in vitro in vivo and clinical tests are being carried out for covid-19 in vitro studies using infected vero e6 cells treated with chloroquine revealed that it cq targets the virus at the entry and post-entry stages during infection furthermore an ec90 value of 690 m against the 2019-ncov in vero e6 cells after 48 h in addition an ec50 of 113 m cc50  100 m and si  8850 was reported for cq this was in keeping with clinical studies where the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients were administered a daily dose of 250 mg of cq bjelle et al 1983 rynes 1997 some cytotoxicity studies confirmed the biosafety of chloroquine cortegiani et al 2020 chloroquine may be potentially clinically applicable against the sars-cov-2 because of the cost and a known safety profile due to long usage for malaria treatment but requires intense scientific scrutiny for covid-19 before use the immune-modulating activity of cq was hypothesized to enhance its antiviral effect in vivo however its toxicity and side effects such as prolonging qt interval can trigger tachycardias such as torsades de pointes this was proven in brazil where 81 patients of covid-19 were evaluated viz a high-dose group receiving 12 g of chloroquine over 10 days and a low-dose group of 27 g over 5 days borba et al 2020 twenty five  of high dose cq group displayed 500 ms of qt elongation and in 17 of them the qt interval elongation was fatal in comparison to the lower dosage group the toxic effects resulted in termination of the trial and indicate that higher dosage and long duration of the treatment courses 10-day regimen should not be recommended for management covid-19 hydroxychloroquine hcq a derivative of chloroquine is a less toxic option that has been widely touted as a treatment option for sars-cov-2 based on various recent trials studies and anecdotal reports in one such study the efficacy of hcq was evaluated in a randomized clinical trial of 62 sars-cov-2 patients chen et al 2020c where the experimental group received 400 mgd hcq treatment for 5 days vs control notably more patients treated with hqc had improved pneumonia 25 of 31 vs untreated groups which showed 548 improvement 17 of 31 notably 2 patients reacted mildly to the adverse effect of hcq in the treatment group while 4 patients progressed to severe illness in the control some showed significant relief through reduced cough and fever supporting hcq as an option in sars-cov-2 infections also a key observation in this study is that by administering hcq the time to clinical recovery ttcr was significantly shortened and promoted the resolution of pneumonia in the group administered with hcq however the methodology was not described the study design was questionable and outcomes were subjective based on an individual clinical opinion despite hcq efficacy against sars-cov-2 the low cost and ease to access its potential adverse side effects in viral diseases must also be carefully considered major side effects of hcq includes elongation of the qt interval thus being contraindicated in patients with underling cardiovascular disease other side effects include liver dysfunction cns effects like headache dizziness insomnia peripheral neuropathy retinopathy associated with long-term therapy gastrointestinal reactions and itching bordy et al 2018 leon et al 2020 the combination of azithromycin and hcq has been proposed to have better treatment outcomes creating a buzz in mainstream media after reports that it may be a treatment option for sars-cov-2 gautret et al 2020a gautret et al 2020b however shortcomings included lack of randomization of the groups and a very small patient cohort and the efficacy of the combination is therefore inconclusive in contrast in another study with similar shortcomings that assessed only 11 patients hcq and azithromycin did not show rapid viral clearance with little clinical benefit 10 out of 11 patients had fever and received nasal oxygen therapy 1 patient died 2 were transferred to the icu in one of the patients hcq and azithromycin had to be discontinued after 4 days because of a prolongation of the qt interval nasopharyngeal swabs in 10 patients 56 days after treatment showed that they were still positive of sars-cov-2 molina et al 2020 the side effects associated with hcq treatment are still a major cause of concern on 9th april the le monde newspaper france reported since march 27 of the 54 reported cases of cardiac disorders there were 7 sudden cardiac arrests 37 cases of prolonged qt and 10 arrhythmias accompanied with syncope including 4 fatalities in patients taking hcq and in some cases in combination with azithromycin cabut 2019 based on anecdotal reports hcq is promising for covid-19 however to date there are no robust studies of hcq which adequately demonstrates efficacy absence of toxicity or proper clinical guidelines for usage currently studies examining hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are underway in order to determine the efficacy and safety and it does not seem promising as some institutions like national institute for health are advising against its use in their guidelines for treatment nih 2020 moreover patients currently on hcq and azithromycin treatment need therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid toxic effects associated with the drug based on the pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 and the viral life cycle several antiviral drugs have been screened and repurposed as targets against covid-19 such drugs include remdesivir an analogue of adenosine which interacts with the viral rna chains and leads to premature termination warren et al 2016 the drug has completed phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of ebola thus the data on its safety for use in humans is available and it can be accelerated to clinical trials if preclinical efficacy against sars-cov-2 is proven lu et al 2020 studies have shown remdesivir to have potent antiviral activity against a clinical isolate of sars-cov-2 preliminary trials have indicated that it was effective against sars-cov-19 in vitro 
lai et al 2020
 and in vero e6 cells results indicated that it acted at the post virus entry stage wang et al 2020b an ec50 of 077 m cc50  100 m and si  12987 was reported in vero e6 cells that were exposed to remdesivir treatment the ec90 value of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells was reported to be 176 m this implies that at this concentration remdesivir may work in clinical models and that at 10 m it completely 100 prevented ebola virus infection warren et al 2016 the drug was then accelerated to clinical trials by us food and drug administrations fda and two phase 3 clinical studies began to evaluate the safety and efficacy a clinical trial showed that three quarters of patients that were on the drug had better outcomes than those who were not gilead 2020 however setbacks such as cohort size the duration of the follow up lack of information about the patients initially treated as well as lack of a control group hindered this study in a recent well designed trial that was randomized double-blind and with a placebo control no statistically significant clinical benefits of remdesivir administration was observed when adult patients were admitted to hospital with severe covid-19 wang et al 2020e however there was reduction in time to clinical improvement in patients given early treatment although the study showed optimism there is a need for studies with a larger group of patients to confirm the results another antiviral drug being considered as anti-sars-cov-2 is camostat mesylate cm which is a clinically proven serine protease inhibitor in vitro studies investigated the antiviral efficacy of cm in caco-2 293t vero and vero-tmprss2 cells lines respectively hoffmann et al 2020b its ability to inhibit the entry of sars-cov-2 was shown this inhibitory property of the drug was enhanced when it was combined with a catbl inhibitor e64d indicating that sars-2 can utilize catbl and tmprss2 for priming in these cell lines the study also showed that cm treatment significantly reduced calu-3 infection with sars-cov-2 this suggests that sars-cov-2 can use tmprss2 for s protein priming and that cm is a good inhibitor of tmprss2 as it blocked the lung infection these findings are in keeping with studies where sars-2-cov-2 exploits ace2 receptor for cellular entry zhou et al 2020b these results provide an understanding of the transmissibility and pathogenesis of sars-cov as well as major targets for therapeutic interventions nafamostat mesylate a drug used to treat acute pancreatitis has shown some potential to inhibit fusion of the envelope of the virus to the host cell surface membranes it has been utilized in japan for many years and there is adequate data to ensure safety hoffmann et al 2020b another drug that is fda approved and is currently being considered as a treatment as an anti-sars-cov-2 is lopinavirritonavir ritonavir and lopinavir a combination drug which is sold under the brand name kaletra showed promise as a target of the coronavirus protease enzyme the protease enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of the gag-pol polyproteins which plays an important role in the virus replication cycle cao et al 2020 the main role of ritonavir in the combination is to enhance protease inhibitor pi regimens in order to improve the pharmacokinetics of the lopinavir the bioavailability of the second lopinavir is greatly improved by the interaction with cyp3a4 and twice daily dosing is made possible this boosted pi regimen is evident by high levels of viral suppression among antiretroviral nave and prior pi treated patients zeldin and petruschke 2004 the clinical benefits of administering lopinavirritonavir to patients with covid-19 was evaluated via a clinical trial involving 199 hospitalized adult patients the outcomes of the study showed there was no difference in the mortality after 28 days of treatment in the group receiving lopinavirritonavir and the standard-care groups moreover gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavirritonavir group however serious effects were experienced in the standard-care group lopinavirritonavir treatment was stopped early in 138 of the patients because of adverse events leading to the conclusion that no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment beyond standard-care cao et al 2020 similar results have been reported in other clinical trials colson et al 2020 however more studies involving high sample sizes of patients at different stages of the disease need to be performed to conclusively determine the efficacy of the drug by tampering with vrna synthesis it is possible to eliminate viruses hence therapeutic drugs such as favipiravir which acts by preventing rna strand elongation and viral proliferation via purine nucleoside inhibition furuta et al 2005 is being considered for sars-cov-2 broad-spectrum activity of favipiravir against rna viruses such as west nile virus poliovirus ebola virus and norovirus rocha-pereira et al 2012 makes it a suitable candidate for sars-cov-2 phase i clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy against sars-cov-2 have begun and doses ranging from 30 to 1600 mgkg have shown no serious adverse effects kobayashi et al 2008 unfortunately a more recent study furuta et al 2017 has shown that favipiravir has teratogenic andor embryotoxic effects favipiravir use has been linked with other mild adverse effects such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and elevation of blood acid levels health 2018 based on these studies favipiravir may be recommended for patients whose condition is not complicated a phase ii chinese clinical trial on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of favipiravir was conducted last year and it is envisaged that the results of this study will shed more light on favipiravir for sars-cov-2 combinations of different classes of antiviral drugs are being proposed to manage covid-19 such initiatives include clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol combination against the novel coronavirus infection the outcome of a randomized clinical trial involving 125 participants is expected in may 2020 clinicaltrialsgov 2020a it is proposed and hypothesized that the combination of these drugs will provide better efficacy against sars-cov-2 as a synergistic effect is expected at the moment most of these therapeutic drugs are still under clinical trials and their efficacy against sars-cov-2 have not been determined holistically other drugs that are currently being investigated at various stages of clinical trials for potential application in sars-cov-2 treatment include pirfenidone targets il-1 and il-4 rintatolimod targets tlr-3 plitidepsin targets ef1a anti-sars-cov-2 polyclonal hyperimmune globulin targets immunoglobulin kevzara targets interleukin-6 brilacidin targets immunoglobulin tak-888 takeda and gimsilumab roivant amongst many others driggin et al 2020 most of the proposed treatment approaches have involved targeting the replication cycle of the virus convalescent plasma therapy involves antibodies ab transfusion a person who has recovered into an infected person to initiate an immune system response against the disease the possible sources of sars-cov-2 abs are human convalescent sera obtained from individuals who have fully recovered from sars-cov-2 through humoral immunity monoclonal antibodies or they can be acquired from animal hosts such as genetically engineered cows who produce human antibodies beigel et al 2018 the convalescent blood products are able to cause neutralization of the virus and ultimately lead to eradication from the blood circulatory system through induction of artificially acquired immunity marano et al 2016 there are ongoing trials of convalescent plasma in patients with sars-cov-2 smith and prosser 2020a 2020b notably on the march 24 2020 the fda granted clinicians the permission to make use of investigational convalescent plasma for single patient use under emergency investigational new drug applications fda 2020 eligible patients have to be positive for sars-cov-2 the disease must be severe and life threatening and they must be able to provide informed consent a more recent study on convalescent plasma treatment for sars-cov-2 shen et al 2020 was conducted in 5 patients with sars-cov-2 who were transfused with convalescent plasma containing sars-cov-2 specific antibody igg binding with titer greater than 11000 this was obtained from 5 patients who just recovered from sars-cov-2 and the newly infected patients were administered the convalescent plasma 10 and 22 days after admission observations after treatment included normalization temperature within 3 days in 4 out of 5 patients increased pao2fio2 and decreased viral load which subsequently became negative within 12 days was observed in addition after 12 days ards was resolved in 4 patients and mechanical ventilation was stopped for 3 patients within 14 days three patients were discharged after 55 days in another study in china 10 patients who had undergone convalescent therapy showed a shortening of the duration of symptoms improved oxygen levels and a drop in the viral load duan et al 2020 these results show that the administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody lead to improved clinical status due to the limited sample size it is suggested that these observations be evaluated in randomized clinical trials with a larger number of participants adjuvant therapy refers to treatment that is given in addition to the primary initial treatment to lower the risk of the disease during management covid-19 patients presenting with bacterial co-infection are associated with serious outcomes in a retrospective study on 191 patients from jinyintan hospital and wuhan pulmonary hospital half of the deaths experienced a secondary infection zhou et al 2020a in wuhan china again another cohort of severely ill patients displayed bacterial and fungal coinfections and common secondary infections included a baumannii k pneumoniae a flavus c glabrata and c albicans chen et al 2020b the co-infections have necessitated the inclusion of antibiotics as adjuvant therapy for covid-19 patients which can be utilized based upon institutional antibiograms and as well as after culture sensitivity testing standard therapy has included ceftriaxone 12 g iv daily in combination with azithromycin 500 mg iv for 3 days ruan et al 2020 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids have also been found to be relevant in the symptomatic treatment of sars-cov-2 paracetamol is indicated to manage the high fever associated with sars-cov-2 nsaids such as ibuprofen have been hypothesized to exacerbate the viral activity as it dampens the immune system increases risk of stroke myocardial infarction and nephrotoxicity moreover acute respiratory tract infections are usually associated with increased risk from those effects therefore even short-term use of nsaids by patients with covid-19 was thought to worsen the disease day 2020 however european medicines agency ema has recently stated that currently there is no scientific evidence for the link between the worsening of covid-19 and ibuprofen ema 2020 who supported this after a systemic review o nsaids usage which indicated no evidence of harm in patients with covid-19 who 2020c a coordinated cytokine response forms part an effective host immune response however a dysregulated pathological outcome in some patients manifests as a hyperinflammatory response fig 3 and some patients infected with sars-cov-2 experience this phenomenon known as a cytokine storm li et al 2020b the use of corticosteroids has been pharmacologically effective in reducing the inflammation as of march 2020 there have been no clinical trials on the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of sars-cov-2 however corticosteroids are administered in high doses for a longer treatment duration resulting in side effects yasir and sonthalia 2019 nonetheless in april zhan et al reported the first case of a covid-19 patient with multiple myeloma being successfully treated with tocilizumab zhang et al 2020d the known effects of cytokine storm by sars-cov-2 infection have been attributed to il-6 therefore the management by tocilizumab is considered as a better option than corticosteroids kotch et al 2019 luo et al reports for successful use of tocilizumab in the management of the cytokine storm call for randomized clinical trials with high number of participants so that clinical guidelines can be drawn mehta et al 2020 other immune modulators and viral entry inhibitors include monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in addition sirolimus and everolimus are macrolides that have been used to prevent organ rejection their target protein is the mtor which belongs to the family of protein kinases kindrachuk et al 2014 they may be used to prevent a cytokine storm experienced by sars-cov-19 patients kiniksa pharmaceuticals has announced early confirmation of treatment response with mavrilimumab it is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is still under investigatory stages it has been shown to target granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor alpha gm-csf trus et al 2020 the basis of this is the involvement of gm-csf in the mechanism of over activation cellular immune response in the lungs it is thought to be the major contributor of the mortality associated with the disease recent reports suggest that patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 have higher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as gm-csf and interferon gamma tsantikos et al 2018 kiniksa is on track to begin phase 2 and 3 clinical development of mavrilimumab for sars-cov-2 pneumonia crotti et al 2019 it is intended to be used in patients suffering from severe sars-cov-2 pneumonia and hyperinflammation thus far 6 patients have been treated with mavrilimumab and all the patients exhibited improved oxygenation as well as early resolution of fever in addition none of the patients required mechanical ventilation furthermore mavrilimumab has shown a high therapeutic index as it was well tolerated bloomberg 2020 severe cases of sars-cov-2 have been associated with a cytokine storm that leads to activation of the coagulation cascade leading to thrombotic phenomena henry et al 2020 iba et al 2020 furthermore there are reports of an association between abnormal coagulation parameters that causes coagulopathy and dic which is linked to mortality in covid-19 patients in a clinical trial of 449 patients with severe covid-19 99 of them received low molecular weight heparin lmwh for 7 days or longer the results indicated a better prognosis in severe covid-19 patients with markedly elevated d-dimer on lmwh than non-coagulant users tang et al 2020a the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin has been recommended as it has shown to decrease mortality in covid-19 patients coppola et al 2020 bioinformatics and cheminformatics are newer strategies to screen and design various drug candidates for sars-cov-2 computation chemistry analytical tools have found relevance in predicting the interactions between therapeutic agents and their binding affinitysites within the human body and the disease-causing organisms this strategy could lead to the generation of more accurate approaches and techniques for sars-cov-2 management for instance a simulation study by kadam and wilson revealed that arbidol umifenovir could be a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses kadam and wilson 2017 aribidol is an anti-influenza drug and its anti-sars-cov-2 effects were determined in predictive in silico studies vankadari 2020 and its efficacy was reinforced via in vitro studies wang et al 2020c such predictive studies make it possible for faster and cost-effective development of drugs after efficacy was proved the drug has been registered for clinical trials kadam and wilson 2017 mina et al 2020 moreover it has now been included in guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus by the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china wang et al 2020c baricitinib which is a janus inhibitor was also subjected to molecular modelling predictions for its potential in the treatment of sars-cov-2b richardson et al 2020b amongst the six drugs with high binding affinity to aak-1 baricitinib which also binds the cyclin g-associated kinase endocytosis regulator was shown to be a promising drug target for sars-cov baricitinib is now in clinical trials for sars-cov in a patient population as it has proven to reduce inflammation and inhibit viral entry richardson et al 2020b studies to date indicate that drugs that have a similar grouping to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may have some activity against sars-cov-2 hu and bajorath 2012 chlorpromazine as well as dasatinib have a similar structure to chloroquine both drugs are also chlorobenzenes and thus can be exploited for potential activity against sars-cov-2 combinations of two or more drugs have a higher probability of achieving the desired targets of viral replication entry and modulation of the host immune response another non-conventional method used to search for drug targets of covid-19 is the use of network-based drug methodology for predicting drug targets wu et al 2018 through development of systems biology and network pharmacology there is a paradigm shift in drug discovery from a linear mode of one drug for one target and one disease to mapping multiple drug targets for multiple diseases via the network based method anighoro et al 2014 network based methodologies apply the power of networks to establish correlations between various data sets of interest for drug discovery for sars-cov-2 the methodology can combine systems pharmacology-based network platforms to identify the various interactions between the virus the host cells and proteins that could be possible drug targets zhou et al built the host-virus interactome network of various viruses such as hcov-229e hcov-nl63 mers-cov and sars-cov mouse hepatitis virus mhv avian infectious bronchitis with virus nucleocapsid protein n protein and 119 host proteins associated with corona virus infection signaling pathways obtained from various experimental studies 
fig 2
 zhou et al 2020c the study found that 47 human proteins could be targeted by at least one fda approved and experimental medicines under clinical trials to further refine the results drugtarget networks were built to generate information related to more than 2000 anti cov drugs that are both approved by fda and those in experimental phase from the network 135 drugs were identified as possible candidates to manage the virus from the dataset 200 were further optimized and the top 16 most repurposable drugs for covid-19 with least expected side-effects and targeting specificity were identified the drugs included irbesartan toremefene camphor equilin mesalazine mecaptopurine paroxetine sirolimus carvedilol colcochine dactinomycin melatonin quinacrine eplerenone emodin and oxymetholone most of the drugs that have been shown clinically to have antiviral activity act via different mechanisms moreover integration of drugtarget networks of the top 16 drug candidates produced of potent drug combinations using a complementary exposure technique chen et al 2020b other studies have also shown the potential of using a network based methodology to screen possible drug targets for sars-cov-2 hofmarcher et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 li et al 2020cthe method is a quick way of identifying drug targets however it is not designed to produce drugs but is a useful tool for prediction of new drugs and combinations and reduces the period of drug screening and development once prediction is done extensive in vitro in vivo and human trial studies are still required artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml can contribute to drug development for covid-19 by improving the speed and efficiency of repurposing and proposing new potent molecules to inhibit sars-cov-2 both al and ml can also be employed to predict the spread of the disease application of ai and ml for the development of diagnostic and monitoring techniques for covid-19 has proven to be successful through increasing accuracy speed and protecting healthcare workers from exposure gozes et al 2020 wang et al 2020d with no effective treatment regimen for covid-19 it is paramount to design therapeutic approaches that repurpose clinically approved drugs by designing new therapies via ai and ml zhavoronkov et al recently reported new druglike molecules against sars-cov-2 targets using machine deep learning zhavoronkov et al 2020 ai and ml were used to screen the possibility of repurposing poly-adp-ribose polymerase 1 parp1 inhibitor cvl218 which is currently in phase i clinical trial to inhibit sars-cov-2 ge et al 2020 using ai it was discovered that baricitinib could be used in the treatment of covid-19 and have now started a randomized-controlled trial with the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to evaluate its efficacy to inhibit covid-19 infection and reduce inflammatory damage due to the disease benevolentai 2020 russell et al 2020 google also recently developed a deep learning system alphafold which was released to predict protein structures associated with covid-19 this usually takes several months via conventional experimental methods to determine and has proven to be a valuable resource for developing covid-19 drug targets and vaccines senior et al 2020 with increased amount of research towards covid-19 and the voluminous data being published this information can be crucial in feeding into ai and ml system for developing potent anti- sars-cov-2 drugs presently antivirals are used to attack viruses after the lungs have been affected it would be advantageous to prevent infection rather than to treat it a novel study has taken on an approach that includes a phage capsid that enveloped flu viruses perfectly so that they cannot infect cells lauster et al 2020 the sars-cov-2 needs a protease called mpro or 3clpro to form its viral replication complex this enzyme can be blocked by a drug which provides a complimentary 3d shape scientists at university of lbeck used high intensity x-rays to elucidate the proteases 3d structure the x-ray structures were reported for sars-cov-2 mpro with -ketoamide inhibitor and resulted in a lead compound that was further developed to produce a potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 the inhibitor 13b showed that it could be well tolerated in mice via the inhalation route zhang et al 2020c direct administration of the molecule to the lungs has some possibility however a pharmaceutical input is needed and it may be several years before it can be used as a coronavirus treatment ter meulen et al 2004 walter et al 2020 in addition to the development of new drugs the design of novel drug delivery systems such as nano-sized systems need to be considered as they have been shown to be superior in the treatment of disease conditions and overcoming drug resistance as compared to conventional dosage forms the identification of suitable drugs will therefore require innovative and superior delivery approaches to maximise their therapeutic efficacy nanosystems provide increased drug accumulation at the target site of the disease increase intracellular penetration protect drugs from degradation increase stability and can prevent mechanisms of drug resistance fig 3
 in addition nanosystems have the ability to incorporate different therapeutic agents which can be released in a controlled manner to the specific target site nanosystems being used for various antiviral drugs can be similarly explored for sars-cov-2 s protein of cov forms the characteristic corona of the virus with distinctive spikes on the viral envelope holmes 2003 as well as complex surface projections with sizes of about 2040 nm ksiazek et al 2003 therefore targeting of the s protein of cov using nanosystems with sizes of about 10100 nm may be a promising approach for early diagnosis as well as treatment hence it is highly recommended that alternate drug delivery systems such as the use of nanomaterials be developed in order to more effectively deliver current and new drugs showing promise in eradicating sars-cov-2 fig 3 below shows a possible mechanism by which nanosystems can be used to target specific sites associated with sars-cov-2 infections according to available literature plant based remedies have been used for centuries to tackle respiratory tract infections and may therefore be helpful in the treatment of sars-cov-2 ren et al 2020 chinese plant based therapy consisting of a mixture of chinese herbs such as san wu huangqin decoction lianhuaqingwen capsules and yinhuapinggan granules have shown to display antiviral properties li et al 2020d the mechanisms of action of such plants are associated with inhibition of replication of viral particles as well as blocking proliferation ren et al 2020 diammonium glycyrrhizinate which is an extract of glycyrrhiza glabra liquorice has been recommended to treat covid-19 chen et al 2020a murck 2020 however no official guidelines have been issued yet the other commonly used herbs in covid-19 management include glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma gancao atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma baizhu saposhnikoviae radix fangfeng lonicerae japonicae flos jinyinhua and forsythiae fructus lianqiao astragali radix astragali radix huangqi saposhnikoviae radix fangfeng and atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma baizhu which are all components of a traditional herbal formula called yupingfeng powder xu and zhang 2020 certain studies have demonstrated that yupifeng powder has anti-inflammatory antiviral and immunoregulatory effects li et al 2020a a review conducted by cochrane found that the combination of traditional chinese medicine with western medicine demonstrated a great improvement in symptoms of sars-cov-2 liu et al 2004 2020c stilbene-based natural compounds were reported to be effective in inhibiting spike protein and human ace2 receptor complex sar-cov2 in silico wahedi et al 2020 unlike conventional medicines herbal and plant products are not well understood and must be used with extreme caution to prevent herb-drug interactions as of now there are no rigorous peer reviewed clinical trials of plant-based therapies most approvals and use are based upon anecdotal clinical reports based upon historical records and ethnomedical sources plant-based therapies could be an alternative source of an anti-sars-cov2 potent drug for an innate immune response by the body to viruses to be initiated the cells must have the ability to identify the pathogen trying to invade it currently there are several clinical trials being directed to develop a vaccine based on several different strategies against sars-cov-2 as illustrated in table 2
 such approaches include those that target the spike glycoprotein s protein as the major inducer of the immune response numerous strategies have been trialled which include and are not limited to the use of the full length s protein s1 receptor binding domain rbd dna or viral vectors and finally expression of virus like proteins vlp dhama et al 2020 phase 1 human clinical trials are anticipated to begin in april 2020 and many have commenced the bill and melinda gates foundation have provided a grant to inovio for a large-scale intradermal vaccine entitled ino-4800 on 16th march 2020 moderna inc started phase 1 trials in 45 healthy volunteers at the kaiser permanente washington health research center as of april 2020 there are more than 115 possible vaccine candidates of sars-cov-2 that are being developed globally smith and prosser 2020a le et al 2020 some of the approaches that have been involved in creating a vaccine have also included the development of attenuated vaccines by introducing a mutation into orf1ab polyprotein the lack of virulence of the mouse coronavirus was demonstrated mhv-a59 due to attenuation of the virus liu et al 2020a dna based vaccines include patent wo2005081716 which induces and enhances immune responses in particular against antigens of the sars coronaviruses the immune response is induced by chimeric nucleic acids which encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum polypeptide such as calreticulin employing gene gun delivery to deliver dna-coated gold particles it was shown that vaccinated animals displayed both humoral and t cell mediated immune response liu et al 2020a another approach involves protein-based vaccines capable of invoking an immune response against sars the one patented by glaxosmithkline contains an s protein immunogen together with oil in water emulsion which is also an adjuvant the vaccine showed induction of high levels of anti-sars-cov igg2a and igg2b antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in animal testing virus-like particle vaccines are being tested by moderna they report that mrna-1273 is an mrna vaccine which targets a prefusion stabilized form of an s protein which is associated with sars-cov-2 httpclinicaltrialsgov
clinicaltrials gov 2020b although the use of vaccines is a generally a better preventive approach unfortunately they are currently undergoing development the few that have been developed are still under different stages of pre-clinical and clinical trials this implies that there is no certainty in respect to their efficacy against sars-cov-2 hence the disease is still a threat globally covid-19 is a pandemic which is currently threatening the health of the entire human race in addition to the global economy therefore providing a solution and cure has become a matter of urgency which may not allow for the development and evaluation of new biomolecules the approval of which is a lengthy process hence a better alternative is to repurpose therapeutic drugs or approaches that can target pathophysiological pathways that are associated with the disease several potential therapeutic agents and approaches against sars-cov-2 have been highlighted and discussed in detail various successful and unsuccessful in vitro and in vivo studies have been reported for drugs that are currently repurposed to treat sars-cov-2 some of these repurposed drugs have shown some encouraging clinical outcomes and have been taken further to different stages of clinical trials however due to the dire need for therapeutic options some of the reported studies are preliminary pilot studies with lower sample sizes have a poor study design such as lack of randomization and do not include controls and placebos in the evaluations there is a need for further investigations that include larger number of participants evaluate long-term implications on human health and identify the toxicity profile of dosages proposed to be effective against the virus future newly designed therapeutic agents orand approaches must be target specific effective and safe to treat the infected patient the development of novel drug delivery systems that target the virus could go a long way in preventing possible viral resistance the development of various vaccines against this deadly virus as a preventative therapeutic is also ongoing as the world is desperately in need of a solution to this virus despite significant progress that has been made by scientists based on in vitro animal cohort studies and clinical trials there is currently no definitive cure and vaccine however some studies appear to be very promising a major limitation observed in all of these studies is that no long-term experimental protocol has been undertaken in order to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the proposed anti sars-cov-2 drugs it is therefore strongly advised that long term studies be conducted for each of the therapeutic approaches and vaccines

coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has infected over 2970000 people and killed more than 206000 in 213 countries since the first outbreak in wuhan china 1 was reported in december 2019 to control this disease effective treatments including sars-cov-2 inhibitors are being actively pursued 1 one potentially efficient approach is the repurposing of drugs previously approved to treat other diseases since they are immediately available for use in clinical trials with covid-19 patients and have known safety profiles coronavirus cov has a large genome and its mutation rate is higher than that of other rna viruses 2 3 animal covs cause persistent enzootic infections that inevitably infect new host species and become zoonotic as happened for sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 due to the diversity and relentlessness of these viruses their individual mitigation is difficult 4 and therefore broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic covs are needed especially for those prone to be periodically cycling in and out of humans and livestock therefore the small molecule inhibitors either old drugs or new chemical entities were actively pursued and developed aiming to prevent or cure the sars-cov and mers-cov infections 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 previous work established the clinical efficacy of pegylated interferon--2a ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir for the treatment of the mers-cov 15 16 therefore the strategy of repurposing existing drugs to treat patients infected with novel or zoonotic cov has been validated and merits consideration in the contest of tackling the sars-cov-2 and covid-19 pandemic two representative covs were selected for existing drugs to be tested against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus fipv belongs to the genus alphacoronavirus and causes enteritis in domestic and wild cats approximately 5-15 of infected cats develop feline infectious peritonitis which is usually fatal 17 18 the pathogenesis epidemiology and pulmonary lesions associated with fipv are similar to those associated with human sars 19 human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 belongs to the same viral genus betacoronavirus as sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infects humans and cattle and is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold 20 21 approximately 250 old drugs or pharmacologically active compounds were assessed for their inhibitory activity of fipv 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 of which 23 were found to exhibit some anti-fipv activity and advanced to testing against hcov-oc43 in total 15 exerted an inhibitory effect on both fipv and hcov-oc43 and they turned out are old drugs these included chloroquine which was recently demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting sars-cov-2 in vitro and exhibited some efficacy in the clinical treatment of covid-19 patients 22 moreover gs-441524 the active metabolite of remdesivir 23 24 which is currently being investigated in clinical trials for severe cases of covid-19 24 25 also exerted potent inhibitory activities against both fipv and hcov-oc43 herein felis catus whole fetus-4 fcwf-4 cells atcccrl-2787 were maintained in dulbeccos modified eagles medium

under an atmosphere of 5 co2 for 48 h sixteen h post inoculation cells were infected with fipv ntu156 strain at 300 tcid50 per well and incubated at 37oc after 1 h the supernatant was discarded and a series of 7 concentrations at different dilution of testing compounds in dmem containing 2 fbs added plates were incubated at 37oc under an atmosphere of 5 co2 for additional 48 h then the cells were fixed with 10 formalin and stained with 01 crystal violet the cytopathic effect cpe of the virus was assumed to correlate with the intensity of the crystal violet staining and measured visually for determination of the 50 effective concentrations ec50 cell cytotoxicity was also measured by crystal violet staining the 50 cytotoxicity concentration cc50 was calculated according a reed and muench

anti-mouse immunoglobulin 55499 mp biomedicals irvine ca usa after three washes with phosphate-buffered saline cells were incubated with the fitc-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 60 min at room temperature the cells were washed three times with pbs and the fluorescence intensities measured using either a spectramax paradigm system molecular devices san jose ca usa excitation and emission wavelengths 485 and 535 nm respectively to determine the ec50 for inhibiting nucleocapsid protein expression or viewed by a fluorescence microscopy hoechst 33258 dye h3569 invitrogen waltham

were treated with a series of 5 concentrations of the test compounds at 5-fold dilution and the results of these assays used to obtain concentration-response curves from which ec50 values were determined the  area of immunofluorescent staining of the cells was used to correct for ec50 values since the fluorescence intensity was disproportionately higher when only small portion of the cells were infected for the cytotoxicity assay hct-8 cells cultured in dmem and 10 fbs in 96-well plates were treated with a designed series of 5 concentrations at 5-fold dilution of the test compounds for

cytopathic effects of these 252 23 were also tested for their inhibition of hcov-oc43 by an ifa against hcov-oc43 nucleocapsid protein table 1
 fifteen of these all old drugs exhibited inhibitory activity against hcov-oc43 and exhibited - ec50 values ranging from 11 nm to 75 m for fipv and 62 nm to 48 m for hcov-oc43 table 1 representative results from the cytopathy fipv and ifa assays hcov-oc43 are depicted in figures 1 and 2
 respectively these 15 drugs include 4 antibiotics antimycin a anisomycin valinomycin and oligomycin with ec50 values of 75 m 23 nm 163 m and 1778 m against fipv and 62 nm 02 m 04 m and 52 m against hcov-oc43 respectively emetine a drug used as an anti-protozoal and previously reported to have anti-coronaviral activity potential 28 exhibited ec50 values of 11 nm against fipv and 021 m against hcov-oc43 homoharringtonine a natural plant alkaloid derived from cephalotaxus fortunei and indicated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia cml 29 exhibited ec50 values of 31 nm against fipv and 029 m against hcov-oc43 niclosamide an anthelmintic indicated for the treatment of tapeworm infections exhibited ec50 values of 029 m against fipv and 136 m against hcov-oc43 interestingly niclosamide also demonstrated efficacy against drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus 30 and showed in vitro activity against sars-cov 11 atovaquone a hydroxy-14-naphthoquinone with antipneumocystic activity 31 exhibited ec50 values of 478 m against fipv and 678 m against hcov-oc43 conivaptan a non-peptide inhibitor of the receptor vasopressin and originally approved for hyponatremia 32 exhibited ec50 values of 169 m against fipv and 122 m against hcov-oc43 atovaquone is predicted to inhibit sars-cov-2 through targeting of the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase or 3c like protease 33 chloroquine is being intensively studied in clinical for treating covid-19 and in preclinical for efficacies against sars-cov-2 both in vitro and in vivo 22 but its ec50 values against fipv 279 m and hcov-oc43 274 m were higher than of the compounds mentioned above nonetheless this identified ec50 of 27 m is comparable or better than the clinically used effective dosages of chloroquine 200  1000 mg in qd or bid 34 35 36 in addition we also tested the nucleotide analogue gs-441524 the active metabolite of remdesivir 23 24 and it exhibited an ec50 of 35 m against fipv compared to an ec50 of 677 m against hcov-oc43 gs-441524 has been reported to exhibit good in vivo efficacy against fipv in cats 23 and against sars-cov in vitro 37 but it is not an fda approved drug yet remdesivir gs-5734 the prodrug of gs-441524 has also shown efficacy for the treatment of covid-19 patients 24 25 moreover this identified ec50 3 7 m of gs-441524 is also equivalent or better than the clinically used effective dosages of remdesivir 100200 mg 24 25thus the concentrations tested in this particular study are of clinical significance other drugs which have already been repurposed in the context of covid-19 include ivermectin a type of avermectin used to treat many types of parasite infestations 38 and the combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin 39 therefore all of these above-mentioned drugs are therefore proposed as potential treatments for covid-19in conclusion several existing drugs were identified as having good inhibitory activities against fipv and hcov-oc43 and the doses at which they are currently used for their respective disease indications could be referenced when contemplating their application against sars-cov-2 in patients of covid-19

tu chian-shiu chien aliaksandr yarmishyn a yi-ying lin yung-hung luo yi-tsung lin wei-yi lai de-ming yang shih-jie chou yi-ping yang mong-lien wang shih-hwa chiou   the twenty-first century has experienced the emergence and epidemic of three previously unidentified coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 and 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov later officially named sars-cov-2 in late december 2019 all of them belong to the coronaviridae a family of viruses that possess a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome similar to other rna viruses this family is characterized by significant genetic variability and high recombination rate that enable them to be easily distributed among humans and animals worldwide as a result numerous coronaviruses exist within human and animal populations without causing life-threatening diseases however occasionally the genetic recombination of viruses within random intermediate hosts produces contagious strains that are highly pathogenic to humans whereas sars-cov-2 is genetically and structurally related to sars-cov it is becoming increasingly clear that it has its own unique features that contributed to the rapid spread around the globe since there is currently no effective treatment available for coronavirus infections significant efforts have been made to the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs preclinical evidence has proven the potential of several countermeasures yet large scale trials are still needed here we review the current understanding of sars-cov-2 such as its epidemiological and clinical features as well as its unique contagious characteristics different from sars-cov and mers-cov providing the essential information for adjusting our responses against the sars-cov-2 pandemic we also summarize the state-of-the-art innovations on targeting sars-cov-2 through a biological and pathological point of view as of april 6 2020 a total of 1285257 cases of covid-19 occurring in at least 170 countries and territories were reported with approximately 54  of fatality rate 703441285257 a prior overview from china that included 72314 confirmed suspected and asymptomatic patients revealed several important epidemiological features of covid-19 in general the majority of confirmed cases are aged 3079 years-old 866 1 among the 1023 deaths the majority were among patients of 60 years of age with the 80 age group characterized by the highest fatality rate 203 among all age groups ref 1 relatively fewer cases were reported among young children 0-9 years-old ref 1 while more males were affected by the disease the male-to-female ratio varies when focusing on different population scales 1061 in china overall 1041 in hubei province and 0991 in wuhan city fortunately for the most affected patients covid-19 pneumonia presentation has been mild moreover while this pathogen has been extraordinarily contagious no deaths have occurred in mild or even severe cases as to be expected the fatality rate reached 49 among patients that were classified as critical cases the usual symptoms of covid-19 include fever 8398 cough 5982 shortness of breath 1955 and muscle ache 1144 which are similar to those of sars and mers ref 2 some patients may have sore throat rhinorrhea headache and confusion a few days before the onset of fever indicating that fever is a critical symptom but not the only initial manifestation of infection ref 2 the pattern of fever has not yet been fully understood a small proportion of patients had hemoptysis 34 and a number of cases were found relatively asymptomatic ref 5 covid-19 patients may have normal or lower white blood cell counts lymphopenia or thrombocytopenia with the increased c-reactive protein level ref 234 people who have fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms with leukopenia or lymphopenia should be suspected for this disease especially for patients with travel history to the endemic area or close exposure record however the clinical course of covid-19 pneumonia exhibits a broad spectrum of severity and progression patterns in some patients dyspnea develops within a median of 8 days after the onset of illness range of 513 days while in others respiratory distress may be absent ref 3 around 329 patients may need the admission to the intensive care unit severely ill patients may have poor disease course of rapid progression to multiple organ dysfunction and even death 23 and those who have shortness of breath and hypoxemia can quickly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome ards severe sepsis with shock and even multiple organ dysfunction within one week ref 46 ards was observed to develop in 1729 of hospitalized patients approximately 8 days after symptoms onset and the global mortality rate reached approximately 54 3 it is also worth noting that the gastrointestinal symptoms of covid-19 may be caused by the direct viral damage to the intestine rather than the immunopathogenic response to the lung infection of the host since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the main cellular receptor of sars-cov-2 is expressed in the human gastrointestinal epithelial cells it is believed that the viral shedding at the gastrointestinal tract and fecaloral transmission is highly plausible ref 7 indeed it was reported that the rectal swabs showed positive results even after the nasopharyngeal tests were constitutively negative 8 besides the live virus was also detected in stool samples of diseased patients this evidence strongly indicate that stool can be contagious for a long time after the discharge of patients based on two negative nasopharyngeal swabs thus adding rectal swabs to the discharge criteria should be considered for the prevention of both nosocomial and community spread of covid-19 aside from the gastrointestinal symptoms a retrospective study of 214 patients in china reported that 56  of patients experienced hypogeusia and 51  experienced hyposmia 9 though the loss of olfaction during sars-cov-2 infection could be explained by the swelling of the nasal mucosa a larger population of patients should be included to determine whether hypogeusia and hyposmia could be a common neurological manifestation of covid-19 nevertheless hyposmia and hypogeusia are now being recommended as the early warning signs and an indication for early self-isolation whereas several human coronaviruses that cause mild respiratory diseases such as hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were estimated to circulate in the human population for centuries sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 were zoonotically transferred from other mammalian species in the last 20 years 12131415 horseshoe bats are the natural reservoirs of these novel coronaviruses and the intermediate hosts that transmitted the virus to the human were identified to be the masked palm civet for sars-cov and dromedary camel for mers-cov table 1 the recent metagenomics study has detected the most similar coronaviruses to sars-cov-2 in the malayan pangolin manis javanica one of the species presumably smuggled to the huanan wet market in wuhan 25 the difference in the transmission patterns between sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 is also indicative of the specific intrinsic characteristics of sars-cov-2 12 in the case of sars-cov and mers-cov substantial virus shedding happens only after the onset of symptoms therefore the transmission mainly occurs in a nosocomial manner namely after the infected patients have sought medical help 35 however human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 occurs predominantly in communities and between family members which might indicate that the pathogen could be spread far before the onset of symptoms a recent study suggested that the half-lives of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were similar in aerosols with the median infectious period estimated to be around 11 to 12 hour 27 therefore as an echo to sars-cov the possibility of air-borne and fecaloral transmission of sars-cov-2 cannot be ruled out however more evidence is still needed in addition to the pre-existing factors that contribute to the blind spot of disease control previous studies found that during active surveillance two individuals with close contact history with confirmed cases showed positive results on rt-pcr another report revealed patients that had been proven to recover from covid-19 by two consecutive rt-pcr tests turned out to show positive results a few days later while the patients continued to be asymptomatic and no people within their close contact were infected they were still considered as infectious viral carriers 24 in conclusion the evidence exists that the infected cases can be contagious before the onset and after treatment of covid-19 pneumonia thus current criteria for hospital discharge and discontinuation of quarantine may have to be reevaluated in order to achieve a more intact protocol for adequate disease control table 1 compares different features of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 belong to the coronaviridae family this family of viruses contains a relatively large single-stranded positive-sense rna genome of around 2732 kb ref 36 their genomes are typically composed of a 5-methylguanosine cap at the beginning a 3-poly-a tail at the end and a total of 6-10 genes in between 12 the order of their genes is usually highly conserved with the first one being replication- and transcription-related and the rest structural the replication- and transcription-related gene is translated into two large non-structural polyproteins by two open reading frames ref 12 the two different yet overlapping open reading frames are translated by ribosomal frameshifting on the other hand the structural proteins including the spike s envelope e and membrane m that constitute the viral coat and the nucleocapsid n protein that packages the viral genome are translated from the subgenomic rnas some of these proteins undergo glycosylation in the golgi apparatus to form glycoproteins among all the structural proteins the most important potential therapeutic target is the spike s glycoprotein which is responsible for the binding of the virus to the host cells s protein is primed by the host cell protease and is recognized by the cellular receptor ref 37 the human serine protease tmprss2 is responsible for priming the s protein of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is engaged as a receptor for the entry of these two viruses as for mers-cov it binds specifically to another receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 12 it is worth noting that not only ace2 expression level but also the allele frequency varies among populations as several ace2 variants have been identified the correlation between disease susceptibility and sequence polymorphism has been hypothesized however the previous study on confirmed cases found no heterogeneity among the residues implicated in the viral s protein binding indicating that sars-cov-2 may associate with a highly-conserved site of human genome the indistinguishable susceptibility between individuals can be another reason for the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 across continents and different human populations 38 the characteristics of the cellular receptor ace2 can also explain the pathogenesis features of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it has been reported that the binding of the viral s protein to ace2 induces a negative feedback loop that ultimately results in downregulation of ace2 the decrease of ace2 subsequently directs its substrate angiotensin i towards its related enzyme ace increased ace activity consequently results in the elevated levels of angiotensin ii once angiotensin ii binds to its receptor agtr1a pulmonary vascular permeability is increased 39 it is recommended by the centers of disease control and prevention that health care professionals obtain specimens from both upper respiratory tract either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal and lower respiratory tract either endotracheal tube or bronchoalveolar lavage diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia is primarily based on the rt-pcr analysis of the specimens if rt-pcr is unavailable serology test may also be considered currently the us food and drug administration fda has approved a sars-cov-2 commercial test system from roche cobas sars-cov-2 this qualitative test requires samples from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and it takes 35 h to yield the results based on rt-pcr methodology the cobas sars-cov-2 test is a dual target assay detecting both the specific sars-cov-2 rna as well as the highly conserved fragment of the e gene invariant in all members of the sarbecovirus subgenus the assay has a full-process negative control positive control and internal control to ensure specificity and accuracy on 21 march 2020 fda granted another emergency use authorization to xpert xpress sars-cov-2 from cepheid inc usa which is also a qualitative test that claimed to yield the results within 45 min it can utilize samples from nasopharyngeal swabs nasal wash or aspirate specimens and highlights a hands-off automated sample processing the results should be viewed as positive if more than one targeted gene is present detected while the current screening methods rely on the presence of abundant viral genome at the site of sample collection studies have demonstrated that the levels of igm antibodies were high in both symptomatic and subclinical patients 5 days after onset of illness thus it was proposed that igm elisa assay can be combined with pcr to enhance the detection sensitivity 40 as there is currently no specific treatment for covid-19 pneumonia clinical management emphasizes the importance of supportive care and prevention of complications and nosocomial transmission when patients experience respiratory distress oxygen should be given immediately however if there is no sign of tissue hypoperfusion fluid resuscitation should be relatively conservative as it may result in lung edema and worsen the oxygen status this concept is particularly important in the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections 41 as it could shorten the duration of ventilation systemic corticosteroids are not recommended either considering their potential to delay viral clearance nevertheless exceptions could be made if corticosteroids are indicated for other reasons standard precautions including respiratory and eye protection are recommended for all healthcare professionals caring for patients with known or suspected covid-19 pneumonia removal of droplet precautions can only be considered when two consecutive rt-pcr that are obtained at least 24 h apart from a clinically recovered patient both show negative results however based on the previous discussion even after two sets of negative tests there are still possibilities that the patients become viral carriers later on we thereby suggest that the decision to remove precautions should be based not only on laboratory radiological and clinical evidence but also on the professional assessment by clinicians and other specialized healthcare personnel remdesivir gs-5734 is by far the most promising drug that exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activities against rna viruses it is a prodrug whose structure resembles adenosine ref 42 therefore it can incorporate into nascent viral rna and further inhibit the rna-dependent rna polymerase this results in premature termination of the viral rna chain and consequently halts the replication of the viral genome remdesivir was originally developed by gilead sciences usa against the ebola virus and has undergone clinical trial during the recent ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo 43 although it has not been shown to be effective against ebola in this trial it proved its safety for humans which allowed it to enter clinical trials immediately in the conditions of covid-19 emergency 43 importantly it has been previously shown to exhibit antiviral activities against different coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov in vitro and in vivo 4445 in a recent in vitro study remdesivir was also shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 46 as was reported in the case report of the first covid-19 patient in the usa remdesivir was used on the 7th day of hospitalization without any noticeable adverse effect and the patients condition improved on the 8th day 47 remdesivir is now being tested in multiple trials in different countries including two randomized phase iii trials in china nct04252664 and nct04257656 that are expected to be completed in aprilmay 2020 similar to remdesivir favipiravir developed by toyama chemical division of fujifilm japan functions as an inhibitor of the rna-dependent rna polymerase by structurally resembling the endogenous guanine 48 through competitive inhibition the efficacy of viral replication can be hugely reduced although it is an approved treatment for influenza less preclinical support has been established for favipiravir to treat sars-cov-2 compared to remdesivir nevertheless patients have been recruited to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir plus interferon- chictr2000029600 based on the expected synergistic effect of viral inhibition and immune enhancement indeed in march 2020 favipiravir was approved by the national medical products administration of china as the first anti-covid-19 drug in china as the clinical trial had demonstrated efficacy with minimal side effects ivermectin is an fda-approved anti-parasitic agent which was also proven to exert antiviral activities toward both human immunodeficiency virus hiv and dengue virus 49 it can dissociate the preformed imp1 heterodimer which is responsible for nuclear transport of viral protein cargos 49 as nuclear transport of viral proteins is essential for the replication cycle and inhibition of the hosts antiviral response targeting the nuclear transport process may be a viable therapeutic approach toward rna viruses 5051 recently an in vivo study has proven ivermectins capability to reduce viral rna up to 5000-fold after 48 h of infection with sars-cov-2 52 with an established safety profile for anti-parasitic use the next step to prove ivermectins efficacy on treating covid-19 involves trials to figure out the adequate dosing aspartyl protease is an enzyme encoded by the pol gene of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv that cleaves the precursor polypeptides in hiv thus playing an essential role in its replication cycle the hiv protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir are therefore used in combination as hiv therapeutic drugs although coronaviruses encode a different enzymatic class of protease the cysteine protease theoretical evidence exists that lopinavir and ritonavir also inhibit the coronaviral 3cl1pro protease 53545556 more importantly a number of clinical animal and in vitro model studies performed on sars and mers proved it to be effective against the respective viruses 46474849 lopinavirritonavir combination was engaged in a clinical trial against covid-19 in patients with mild and moderate covid-19 nct04252885 however it showed little benefit for improving the clinical outcome 45 in another trial performed on patients with severe covid-19 chictr2000029308 no benefits of lopinavirritonavir beyond standard care were observed 57 the soluble recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 rhace2 is expected to block the entry of sars-cov-2 by blocking the s protein from interacting with the cellular ace2 indeed in a recent study it was reported that rhace2 could inhibit sars-cov-2 replication in cellular and embryonic stem cell-derived organoids by a factor 1000-5000 times 58 it is believed that the administration of the recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 rhace2 can decrease serum level of angiotensin ii by directing the substrate away from the related enzyme ace like mentioned earlier this could prevent further activation of ace2 receptor and thereby preserve the pulmonary vascular integrity and prevent ards 59 apn01 originally developed by apeiron biologics has already undergone phase ii trial for ards a small pilot study in china nct04287686 is now evaluating the biological and physiological role of rhace2 in covid-19 pneumonia especially as a treatment of ards later apeiron biologics has initiated a placebo controlled double blinded dose-escalation study to access the safety and tolerability of intravenous apn01 it is believed that by measuring plasma level of angiotensin ii and angiotensin 1-7 the bioproducts interfered by the potential drug the biological and physiological role of rhace2 in covid-19 pneumonia could be evaluated as a well-known antimalarial and anti-autoimmune agent hydroxychloroquine can also block virus infection by increasing endosomal ph required for membrane fusion between the virus and the host cell 60 moreover it was shown to specifically inhibit the replication of sars-cov by interfering with the glycosylation of its cellular receptor ace2 61 recently in vitro testing revealed its ability to effectively reduce the viral copy number of sars-cov-2 24 therefore a number of clinical trials have been quickly conducted in china which demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine was to various degree effective in treatment of covid-19-associated pneumonia similarly in a small open-label non-randomized clinical trial from france hydroxychloroquine demonstrated positive effect in combination with azithromycin 62 in the wake of this evidence the us fda issued an emergency use authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19 in the usa it is noteworthy that the latest study found no evidence of clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of 11 patients with severe covid-19 63 thus larger randomized controlled trials are needed for further evaluation approved by russia and china arbidol is an entry inhibitor against influenza viruses and arboviruses 64 targeting hemagglutinin ha the major glycoprotein on the surface of influenza virus arbidol prevents the fusion of the viral membrane with the endosome after endocytosis currently it is undergoing trials as a single agent nct04260594 nct04255017 in a randomized clinical trial aimed at comparing arbidol with favipiravir chictr2000030254 the latter was demonstrated to be far more superior in treatment outcome 65 the highest mortality rate inflicted by covid-19 is observed among the elderly patients which may be explained by the weakening of the immune system with age therefore the approaches aimed at boosting the innate anti-viral immune responses are of great potential natural killer nk cells constitute an important component of the innate immune system that ensures rapid response to viral infection previous study has shown that pulmonary migration of nk cells and macrophages plays a significant role in the clearance of sars-cov 66 the innate response itself without the assistance from the cd8 t cells and antibodies is able to control sars-cov infection by increasing the production of cytokines and chemokines whether the addition of nk cells could help to reach viral clearance in covid-19 pneumonia is under phase i trial nct04280224 in china estimated to be completed by the end of 2020 several companies aim to repurpose their anti-cancer nk-based products to treat covid-19 among them are the jointly developed product from the green cross labcell from south korea with kleo pharmaceuticals from the us the usa-based company celularity has developed the placenta haematopoetic stem cell-derived nk cells cynk-001 type i interferons are secreted by the virus-infected cells when used alone or in combination with other drugs they exert a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against hcv respiratory syncytial virus sars-cov 67 and mers-cov 68 trials are now focusing on their safety and efficacy in treating covid-19 pneumonia nct04293887 mesenchymal stem cells mscs have been proven to exert anti-inflammatory function by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and producing paracrine factors to repair tissues preclinical evidence has also shown that mscs are able not only to restore endothelial permeability but also reduce inflammatory infiltrate 69 while the immunomodulating effects of mscs have been proven on avian influenza viruses 70 their role in covid-19 pneumonia is still under evaluation at present mscs from the umbilical cord and dental pulp are being tested nct04293692 nct04269525 nct04288102 nct04302519 intravenous immunoglobulin ivig has been widely applied in the field of neurology dermatology and rheumatology in a dose-dependent manner ivig exerts diverse effects on the immune system generally at low doses 02-04gkg ivig is used as a replacement therapy for antibody deficiencies while at higher doses up to 2gkg ivig exhibits its immunomodulatory functions such as suppressing inflammatory cells proliferation inhibiting phagocytosis and interfering antibody-dependent cytotoxicity 71 current trials focus on the supplementary effects of low dose ivig 05gkg for 5 days nct04261426 the humoral immune response mediated by antibodies is crucial for preventing viral infections therefore the development of the specific surface epitope-targeting neutralizing antibodies is a more long-term albeit more specific approach to target covid-19 72 abcellera canada and eli lilly and company usa are co-developing a functional antibody that could neutralize sars-cov-2 in infected patients for this purpose they screened through more than 5 million immune cells from one of the first us patients who recovered from covid-19 and identified more than 500 of the potential anti-sars-cov-2 antibody sequences which are currently undergoing screening to find the most effective ones whereas such an approach is time-consuming and effort-demanding it is encouraging that it has been successfully applied to manufacture the specific functional antibodies against the west nile virus 73 vir biotechnology inc immunoprecise mount sinai health system and harbour biomed hbm are also screening to find monoclonal antibodies to tackle sars-cov-2 although all of them are still in preclinical stages eligible candidates are expected to exert both prophylactic and therapeutic effects as complement activation has been demonstrated in acute lung injury c5a the bioactive molecule cleaved from c5 is responsible for the full development of tissue injury the role of c5a includes recruitment of neutrophils and t-lymphocytes and increasing pulmonary vascular permeability 74 it has also been proved that anti-c5a treatment could reduce lung injury by decreasing vascular leakage and neutrophil influx into the alveolar space hence bdb-1 launched by beijing defengrei biotechnology co and ifx-1 produced by beijing staidson biopharma and inflarx are anti-c5a monoclonal antibodies targeting the foundation of the inflammatory response expected to attenuate the level of lung injury caused by sars-cov-2 interleukin il-6 tnf- and il-1 are the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines in the human body specifically il-6 is a predictive factor of poor prognosis in patients with ards 75 recently it has also been reported that the elevated interleukin-6 il-6 is strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation 76 the classical pathway of il-6 signaling occurs through il-6 receptors which are expressed on neutrophils monocytes macrophages and other leukocyte populations 77 besides binding to the membrane-bound il-6 receptor mil-6r cd126 il-6 can also bind to the soluble form of il-6 receptor created by proteolytic cleavage of mil-6r or alternative splicing of mrna an elevated level of circulating il-6 is associated with a faster decline of lung elasticity and more severe bronchoalveolar inflammation hence specific blockade of il-6-regulated signaling pathways represents a promising approach to attenuate inflammation-associated damage 78 moreover it is reported that in the tuberculosis model in mice il-6 blockade did not lead to an increase of bacterial burden in the lung on the contrary neutralizing tnf antibodies resulted in a significant increase in mycobacterial colony units eusa pharma has initiated a study to evaluate the effectiveness of siltuximab a monocloncal antibody against il-6 in treating covid-19 patients with ards on the other hand tiziana life sciences is developing an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tzls-501 to treat the disease from another perspective the company believes that administrating anti-il-6 antibody could result in an inhibition of downstream signaling either membrane bound or soluble il-6 receptors and a reduction in circulating il-6 levels regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi are also conducting a phase ii and a phase iii trial on kevzara sarilumab an il-6 receptor antagonist in severe and critical covid-19 patients nct04315298 though kevzara has proven its efficacy in treating arthritis 79 its efficacy in treating sars-cov-2 is still unknown recently thalidomide has re-emerged as an antiangiogenic anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent through decreasing the synthesis of tnf-alpha thalidomide has been used as a treatment for multiple inflammatory diseases such as crohns disease and behcets disease 80 in addition preclinical studies proved that thalidomide was effective in treating h1n1-infected mice by reducing infiltration of inflammatory cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 81 current studies are focusing on its immunomodulatory effects that could lessen lung injury caused by excessive immune response to sars-cov-2 nct04273529 nct04273581 as was mentioned earlier systemic glucocorticoids are currently contraindicated in sars-cov-2 infection as they may prolong viral clearance however it is also known that the underlying pathogenesis of covid-19 pneumonia is composed of both the direct damage caused by the virus and the excessive immune response from the host thus whether methylprednisolone administration would help suppress the unwanted immune reactions is controversial therefore studies have been initiated to explore its effectiveness and safety nct04273321 nct04263402 fingolimod is an oral immunomodulating agent that is primarily used to treat refractory multiple sclerosis by structurally resembling the lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate s1p fingolimod can act as a highly potent functional antagonist of s1p1 receptors in the lymph node t cells through the effective binding s1p1 receptors are internalized and the lymph node t cells are subsequently sequestered 82 decreased pulmonary influx of t lymphocytes is another approach to attenuate uncontrolled immunopathogenesis nct04280588 elevated vascular endothelial growth factor vegf level is observed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome vegf functions as a mediator that can induce endothelial injury and increase microvascular permeability 83 bevacizumab a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody widely used in treating multiple types of cancers is capable of blocking angiogenesis by specific binding to vegf an ongoing trial is now evaluating the effectiveness of bevacizumab as a unique approach to treat sars-cov-2 infection nct04275414 in early january 2020 soon after the outbreak of covid-19 pneumonia the genome of sars-cov-2 has been sequenced modernas mrna-1273 is a synthetic strand of mrna that encodes the prefusion-stabilized viral spike protein after intramuscular injection to human bodies it is expected to elicit antiviral response specifically toward the spike protein of sars-cov-2 besides unlike conventional vaccines which are either made from inactivated pathogen or small subunits of live pathogen synthesis of the lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mrna vaccine does not require the virus therefore it is relatively safe and ready to be tested if mrna-1273 proves to be safe for humans and pass the phase i trial successive evaluation of its efficacy will be carried out immediately nct04283461 ino-4800 is a dna vaccine candidate created by inovio pharmaceuticals like modernas mrna-1273 ino-4800 is also a genetic vaccine that can be delivered to human cells and translated into proteins to elicit immune responses compared to conventional vaccines genetic vaccines require lower costs of production and easier way of purification the simple structure of nucleic acids also obviates the risk of incorrect folding which could occur in recombinant protein-based vaccines 6869 however the amount of plasmid delivered and the adequate interval and route of administration are the factors that may influence the immunogenicity of genetic vaccines this vaccine created by the university of oxford is composed of a non-replicating adenovirus vector and the genetic sequence of the s protein of sars-cov-2 and has entered a phase iii clinical trial nct04324606 the non-replicating nature of adenovirus in the host makes it relatively safe in children and individuals with underlying diseases besides the adenovirus-based vectors are characterized by a broad range of tissue tropism that covers both respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium the two main sites that express the ace-2 receptor of sars-cov-2 however the possibility of dominant immunogenicity toward the vector genes rather than the transgenes should always be considered 45 enveloped viruses require fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane for infection this process involves the conformational change of the viral glycoprotein from the pre-fusion form to the post-fusion form although the pre-fusion glycoproteins are relatively unstable they are still able to elicit strong immune responses 84 thus the university of queensland is developing a stabilized subunit vaccine based on the molecular clamp technology which would allow recombinant viral proteins to stably remain in their pre-fusion form previously applied to influenza virus and ebola virus molecular clamp vaccines have proved their capacity to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies they were also reported to be potent after two weeks at 37 c nanoparticle-based platforms represent an alternative strategy to incorporate antigens through encapsulation or covalent functionalization nanoparticles can be conjugated with antigenic epitopes mimic viruses and provoke antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation as well as cytokine production in addition mucosal vaccination through intranasal or oral spray can not only stimulate immune reactions at the mucosal surface but also provoke systemic responses 85 this demonstrates the potential of nanoparticle-based vaccines to protect humans against respiratory viruses that cause systemic symptoms novavax inc is producing a nanoparticle-based vaccine using antigens derived from the coronavirus s protein the protein is stably expressed in the baculovirus system and the product is anticipated to enter phase i trial this summer based on the knowledge that antigen-specific t cells are able to eradicate cancer cells as well as viral infections generating large amounts of t cells with viral antigen specificity in a timely manner may well help us withstand the invasion of sars-cov-2 efficient methods to produce massive amounts of t cells include appropriate antigen-presenting cells that can activate effector t cells and the differentiation and proliferation of corresponding effector cytotoxic t cells 24 hence the genetically modified artificial antigen-presenting cells aapcs that express the conserved domains of the viral structural proteins delivered by lentivirus vector are supposed to evoke the nave t cells in the human body and lead to differentiation and proliferation trials are now evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of aapcs alone and in combination with antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells nct04299724 nct04276896 in this article we present an overview of the current state of knowledge on the sars-cov-2 and covid-19 pandemic in addition to an overview of the epidemiological clinical and radiological features of sars-cov-2 figure 1 we also summarize possible therapeutic options currently under investigation and the future outlook for the disease we also speculate on several mechanisms contributing to the novel profile of covid-19 pneumonia including its high transmissibility caused by unvaried ace2 structure at the viral binding site among different populations and its unique progression pattern in which patients could be asymptomatic yet presenting positive radiographic or laboratory findings we summarize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated upon the onset of the pandemic emergency and are currently undergoing as for april 2020 most of them are based on repurposing the therapeutic agents previously designed for other applications these agents can be divided into two broad categories those that can directly target the virus replication cycle and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses whereas the vaccines and therapeutic antibodies aimed to specifically target sars-cov-2 are also being tested this solution is more long-term as they require thorough testing of their safety on the other hand drug repurposing happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety and have demonstrated their action against other viruses including the related sars-cov and mers-cov these drugs target different viral infection response pathways or directly interfere with the virus replication cycle as summarized in figure 2 as for now some of them have already demonstrated promising results in the initial clinical trials performed in the wake of the pandemic and have been approved for a wider use the promising examples include favipiravir an influenza drug that interferes with the viral replication and hydroxychloroquine a repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway by posing a significant challenge toward the public health system and the existing antiviral strategies sars-cov-2 has undoubtedly grabbed the globes attention in the beginning of 2020 we believe this may be a trigger for more systematic approaches to prepare ourselves in advance for any potential future pandemics in the era of big data more systematic approaches to identify the potential agents for drug repurposing can be applied noteworthy is the recent study by zhou et al whereby an integrative analysis of interactome networks associated with human coronaviruses and drugs targeting the components of these networks was applied to reveal 16 novel candidates for drug repurposing 86 we believe that such computational techniques combined with the follow-up experimental studies aimed to test the computationally predicted antiviral agents can help us to have a wider arsenal of potentially repurposed drugs in the case of any future virus outbreaks  old weapon for new enemy drug repurposing for treatment of newly emerging viral diseases deyin guo   emerging and re-emerging viral diseases are a public health concern for the whole world and pose a major threat to human health and life in last decades numerous major outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral diseases with gross public concern were recorded in different regions including ebola in western africa zika in south america h7n9 in china and many asian countries and h1n1 influenza worldwide in particular coronaviruses were once regarded as the ones that just cause mild symptoms like common cold but three new types of coronaviruses which emerged in the 21st century can cause severe diseases with high fatality and morbidity severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov emerged in november 2002 in guangdong china and caused globally 8098 human infections with 774 deaths 96 and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus mers-cov emerged in 2012 in saudi arabia and caused 2494 infections with 858 associated deaths 344 as of november 2019 who 2020a b in december 2019 a dozen of patients with unusual pneumonia were hospitalized in wuhan in central china and the causative agent was identified as a new type of coronavirus zhu et al2020 huang et al2020 the new virus was temporarily named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by the world health organization who as of january 29 2020 7736 confirmed cases of 2019-ncov infection with 170 deaths were reported in china and additional 77 cases in other 16 countries national health commission of the peoples republic of china 2020 who 2020c since the emerging viruses are previously unknown pathogens there are no specific and effective drugs available therefore there is an urgent need for antiviral treatment in fighting the emerging viral diseases however the development of antiviral drugs is time- and resource-consuming and thus repurposing of existing drugs to treat emerging viral diseases represents one of efficient strategies for drug development in a very recent work by a research team led by drs gengfu xiao wu zhong and zhihong hu the antiviral efficiency of the fda-approved drugs including ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine cq and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir rdv gs-5734 and favipiravir t-705 were evaluated against a clinical isolate of 2019-ncov in a cell culture infection model wang et al2020 the authors found that two compounds cq ec50 value  113 moll cc50  100 moll si  8850 and rdv ec50  077 moll cc50  100 moll si  12987 potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index si from the in vitro results these two compounds appear promising to be transformed into clinical drugs for treatment of 2019-ncov infections rdv is an adenosine analogue prodrug and can be incorporated into nascent chains of viral rna resulting in pre-mature termination of rna synthesis rdv has been shown to possess a potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a diverse panel of rna viruses such as sars-cov mers-cov ebola virus ebov marburg virus nipah virus hendra virus and respiratory syncytial virus in cell culture and mouse infection models warren et al2016 sheahan et al2017 lo et al2017 currently it is in clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy against ebola virus infections the study by wang et al 2020 extends its antiviral activity to the new deadly coronavirus 2019-ncov however rdv has not been used in any clinical treatment and the clinical effectiveness and safety needs to be further investigated remarkably cq was identified as a potent inhibitor against 2019-ncov in cell culture infection model wang et al2020 cq a weak base 4-aminoquinolone derivative has been used as a standard antimalarial drug for more than half a century for its rapid schizonticidal activity against all malarial parasite infections cq also has anti-inflammatory properties and has been approved for the clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis rainsford et al2015 recently cq has been proven to have a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of viruses including sars-cov mers-cov ebov influenza a virus chikungunya virus human immunodeficiency virus dengue virus west nile virus crimean congo hemorrhagic fever virus and hepatitis a virus garca-serradilla et al2019 it is not surprising that cq can suppress the infection of a diverse group of viruses cq can efficiently enter the cells and accumulate in acidic compartments like lysosomes endosomes and trans-golgi network vesicles consequently raising their ph value while many viruses need the acidic endocytic organelles at some stages of their replication such as viral uncoating and cellular entry via membrane fusion cq is also able to impair the maturation of viral proteins and post-translational modification viral receptors like ace2 for sars-cov by inhibition of ph-dependent enzymes such as proteases or glycosyltransferases savarino et al2003 in view of its antiviral activity to sars-cov and mers-cov it is not unexpected that cq possesses an antiviral activity against 2019-ncov however this finding is clinically important and timely as the 2019-ncov is currently spreading rapidly in china and causing severe respiratory diseases and deaths of many patients as cq is the first-line drug for the treatment of malaria and other illnesses with a proven safe record for several decades it most likely represents the best candidate to be applied and evaluated immediately in the clinical treatment of acute 2019-ncov infections for benefits of 2019-ncov patients it is suggested that the potential clinical use of cq be exploited and its efficacy evaluated during the 2019-ncov epidemics all the repurposed uses of cq in the treatment of viral diseases should comply with the regulations of the administrative authorities and medical ethics although cq belongs to the safest antimalarial drugs ever discovered adverse effects of cq alone or in combination with other drugs were also observed among some patients who showed mild symptoms such as dizziness nausea and diarrhoea chattopadhyay et al2007 in rare occasions long-term use of cq may be associated with neuromyopathy and retinopathy chattopadhyay et al2007 cq is considered safe for use during pregnancy but its administration is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity severe renal and hepatic diseases a history of epilepsy and psoriasis therefore when used in the control of viral diseases contraindication of cq should be taken into account by evaluation of the physical condition underlying diseases and comorbidities of the patients it is hoped that cq and many other approved clinical drugs can be repurposed to the antiviral treatment of emerging viral diseases that do have other effective antiviral treatment  network medicine framework for identifying drug repurposing opportunities for covid-19 deisy gysi morselli talo do valle marinka zitnik asher ameli xiao gan onur varol helia sanchez rebecca baron marlene dina ghiassian joseph loscalzo albert-lszl barabsi  the covid-19 pandemic demands the rapid identification of drug-repurpusing candidates in the past decade network medicine had developed a framework consisting of a series of quantitative approaches and predictive tools to study host-pathogen interactions unveil the molecular mechanisms of the infection identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurpusing candidates here we adapt the network-based toolset to covid-19 recovering the primary pulmonary manifestations of the virus in the lung as well as observed comorbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases we predict that the virus can manifest itself in other tissues such as the reproductive system and brain regions moreover we predict neurological comorbidities we build on these findings to deploy three network-based drug repurposing strategies relying on network proximity diffusion and ai-based metrics allowing to rank all approved 1 arxiv200407229v1 q-biomn 15 apr 2020 drugs based on their likely efficacy for covid-19 patients aggregate all predictions and thereby to arrive at 81 promising repurposing candidates we validate the accuracy of our predictions using drugs currently in clinical trials and an expression-based validation of selected candidates suggests that these drugs with known toxicities and side effects could be moved to clinical trials rapidly  the speed and the disruptive nature of the covid-19 pandemic has taken both public health and biomedical research by surprise demanding the rapid deployment of new interventions the development and testing of an effective cure and vaccine given the compressed timescales the traditional methodologies relying on iterative development experimental testing clinical validation and approval of new compounds are not feasible a more realistic strategy relies on drug repurposing requiring us to identify clinically approved drugs with known toxicities and side effects that may have a therapeutic effect in covid-19 patients in the past decade network medicine has developed and validated a series of computational tools that help us identify drug repurposing opportunities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  here we deploy these tools to analyze the molecular perturbations induced by the virus sars-cov2 causing a pathophenotype disease known as covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 and to identify potential drug repurposing candidates we start by characterizing the covid-19 disease module fig 1a  representing the network neighborhood of the human interactome perturbed by sars-cov2 and its integrity in 56 tissues to identify the tissues and organs the virus could invade we then explore multiple network-based strategies to prioritize existing drugs based on their ability to interact with their protein targets and thereby perturb the disease module network proximity-based methods that use a graph theoretic repurposing strategy 2  diffusion-based methods to capture node similarity 8  and approaches relying on artificial intelligence network ai-net that embed all available data to detect efficacy 5 6  these three predictive approaches offer us twelve ranked lists normally applied independently and validated on different datasets here we combine them using a rank aggregation algorithm 9  allowing to exploit their relative advantages and to obtain a final prioritized ranking of drug repurposing candidates that offers higher accuracy than any of the pipelines alone after eliminating drugs based on toxicity delivery and appropriateness of their use in covid-19 patients we selected 81 approved drugs as candidates for drug repurposing finally we integrate experimental data from in vitro models to help identify the networkbased mechanism of action for selected compounds and offer further validation using existing gene expression data fig 1b 10 11  sars-cov2 infects human cells by hijacking the hosts translation mechanisms to generate 29 viral proteins which bind to multiple human proteins to initiate the molecular processes required for viral replication and additional host infection 12  gordon et al 13 expressed 26 of the 29 sars-cov2 proteins and used affinity-purification followed by mass spectrometry to identify 332 human proteins to which the viral proteins bind table s1 13  we mapped these 332 proteins to the human interactome consisting of 18 508 proteins and 332 749 pairwise interactions between them see methods of the 332 viral targets 239 proteins form a multiply connected subnetwork of viral targets  fig 2a  and 93 viral targets do not interact with other targets but only with other human proteins we find that 208 viral targets form a large connected component lcc fig 2a  to test whether the observed lcc could have emerged by chance we randomly placed 332 proteins in the interactome while matching the degrees of the original viral targets the obtained random lcc of size 18323  1493 proteins and the comparative z-score 165 indicates that the sars-cov2 target-proteins aggregate in the same network vicinity 3 14  defining the location of the covid-19 disease module within the human interactome potential drug repurposing candidates must either target proteins within or in the network vicinity of this disease module previous work indicates that the expression of a gene associated with a disease in a particular tissue is insufficient for a disease to be manifest in that tissue but a statistically significant disease lcc for must be expressed 15  we therefore measured the statistical significance of the covid-19 lcc in 56 tissues using data from gtex 16  with gtex median value  5 only 10 823 58 of the 18 406 proteins in the interactome are expressed in lung 15 16  while of the 332 viral targets fig 2c  214 64 are expressed we find that 182 viral targets form a tissue specific lcc and given the random expectation of 15561  1482 for this lcc we obtain a z-score 178 for the lung larger than the z-score 165 of the lcc in the full-network overall in 30 tissues the lcc exceeds the z-score of the full-network helping us to identify tissues where the virus-induced disease could be manifested  table 1  the list contains pulmonary and cardiovascular tissues supporting the clinical observations that covid-19 manifests itself in the respiratory system 17 18  but infected patients often present significant cardiovascular involvement 17 19  and patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases show increased risk of death 20  interestingly table 1 indicates that the lcc is also expressed in the multiple brain regions likely explaining the recently reported neurological manifestations 21-23 of the disease we also observe multiple tissues related to the digestive system colon esophagus pancreas in this analysis again consistent with clinical observations finally equally unexpected is the fact that table 1 indicates expression in multiple reproductive system tissues vagina uterus testis cervix ovary as well as spleen potentially related to disruptions in the regulation of the immune system 24 25 table 1  pre-existing conditions worsen prognosis and recovery of covid-19 patients 26  previous work has shown that the disease relevance of the human proteins targeted by the virus can predict the symptomssigns and diseases caused by a pathogen 14  prompting us to identify diseases whose molecular mechanisms overlap with cellular processes targeted by sars-cov2 allowing us to predict potential comorbidity patterns 27 28 29  we retrieved 3 173 disease-causing genes for 299 diseases 30  finding that 110 of the 320 proteins targeted by sars-cov2 are implicated in disease however the overlap between sars-cov2 targets and the pool of the disease genes is not statistically significant fishers exact test fdr-bh p adj -value 005 we therefore evaluated the network-based overlap between the proteins associated with each of the 299 diseases and the targets of sars-cov2 using the s vb metric 30  where s vb  0 signals a network-based overlap between the sars-cov2 viral targets v and the gene pool associated with disease b we find that s vb  0 for each disease indicating that sars-cov2 disease module does not directly overlap with any major disease module  fig s1 and table s2  the diseases closest to the covid-19 proteins smallest s vb  include several cardiovascular diseases and cancer whose comorbidity in covid-19 patients is well documented 19 31 32 fig 3  the same metric predicts comorbidity with neurological diseases in line with our observation that the viral targets are expressed in the brain table 1  in summary we find that the sars-cov2 targets do not overlap with disease genes associated with any major diseases indicating that a potential covid-19 treatment can not be derived from the arsenal of therapies approved for specific diseases these findings argue for a strategy that maps drug targets without regard to their localization within a particular disease module however the diseases modules closest to the sars-cov2 viral targets are those with noted comorbidity for covid-19 infection such as pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases and cancer we also find multiple network-based evidence linking the virus to the nervous system a less explored comorbidity consistent with the observations that many infected patients initially lose olfactory function and taste 33  and that 36 of patients with severe infection requiring hospitalization have neurological manifestations 21  traditional repurposing strategies focus on drugs that target the human proteins to which viral proteins bind 13  or on drugs previously approved for other pathogens the network medicine approach described here is driven by the recognition that most approved drugs do not target directly disease proteins but bind to proteins in their network vicinity 34  hence our goal is to identify drug candidates that may or may not target the proteins to which the virus binds but nevertheless have the potential to perturb the network vicinity of the virus disease module to achieve this end we utilized several network repurposing strategies a network proximity strategy identifying drugs whose targets are in the immediate network vicinity of the viral targets 2  a diffusion-based strategy 8  and an ai-net based strategy that uses machine learning to combine multiple sources of evidence 56 fig 1b  we test the predictive power of each method independently using a list of drugs under clinical trial for covid-19 and combine the evidence provided by each method arriving at a ranked list of drug repurposing candidates derived from the complete list of drugs in drugbank see methods proximity-based methods allow us to measure the distance between two sets of nodes in a network also determining the statistical significance for the observed proximity here we use proximity to explore the distance between the viral protein targets approximating the covid-19 disease module and i the targets of approved drugs and ii the differentially expressed genes induced by each drug arriving at three drug ranking lists  pipeline p1 for each drug we measured the network distance to the closest protein targeted by covid-19 and applied a degree-preserving randomization procedure to assess its statistical significance expecting a z-score 0 for proximal drugs for example chloroquine a rheumatological and antimalarial drug currently in clinical trial for covid-19 has z-score182 indicating its proximity to sars-cov2 targets in contrast etanercept another anti-inflammatory drug with no supported covid-19 relevance has a z-score129 indicating that the drugs protein targets are far from the sars-cov2 viral targets fig 4a  we tested the proximity of 6 116 drugs with at least one target in drugbank identifying 385 drugs with z-scores 2 and 1 201 drugs with z-scores 1 representing potential repurposing candidates fig 4b   pipeline p2 we computed the proximity z-score after disregarding for each drug the targets that are enzymes carriers or transporters these are proteins targeted by multiple drugs and are often unrelated to the known pharmacological effects of the profiled drugs of the 5 550 drugs obtained after the filtering the metric identified 165 drugs with z-scores 2 and 541 with z-scores 1 using this measure chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are less proximal to covid-19 targets while ribavin an antiviral drug in clinical trial gain more proximity fig 4c   pipeline p3 the effect of a drug is rarely limited directly to the target proteins but the drug can activate or repress biological cascades and biochemical pathways that change the expression patterns of multiple proteins in the network neighborhood of the drugs targets drugbank compiles 17 222 differentially expressed genes degs linked to 793 drugs in multiple cell lines we measured the proximity between degs and covid-19 targets for 793 drugs finding 18 drugs with z-scores  2 and 82 drugs with z-scores  1 in summary each of the pipelines p1-p3 offer a list of drug candidates ranked by the proximity z-score of the respective pipeline diffusion state distance dsd methods rank drugs based on the network similarity of their targets to covid-19 protein targets the similarity of two nodes captures the overlap of two global network-wide states following the independent perturbation of the two nodes we implemented three statistical measures that resulted in five ranking pipelines see methods  pipeline d1 l1 norm manhattan distance calculates similarity through the sum over the absolute value of differences between the elements of the two vectors providing a symmetric measure whose lower values reflect higher similarity  pipeline d2  as the l1 norm may result in loss of information 35  we also implemented the kullback-leibler kl divergence 36  which calculates the relative entropy of the vector representation of the two nodes reporting the average asymmetric similarity value over the minimum pairwise similarity values kl-min and resulting in values between 0 and 1  pipeline d3 we deployed the kl divergence measure discussed above but reporting the average similarity value over the median pairwise similarity kl-median  pipeline d4 we implemented jensen-shannon js divergence 37  a modified symmetrized and smoothed version of the kl divergence reporting the average over the minimum value of pairwise similarities js-min  pipeline d5 similar to d4 but we report the average over the median value of pairwise similarities js-median we used these five metrics to rank 3 225 drugs as potential treatments for covid-19 baricitinib for example is a rheumatological drug currently in trial for covid-19 and all diffusion-based pipelines rank it higher than tocilizumab a drug also indicated for rheumatological and severe inflammatory diseases with no proven covid-19 relevance we adopted machine learning tools previously developed for drug repurposing using the protein-protein interaction network as input 38 39  resulting in the ai-net pipeline that exploits the power of ai in a network context 39 see methods the method learns how to represent ie embed the multimodal graph into a compact low-dimensional vector space such that the algebraic operations in the learned embedding space reflect the topology of the input network fig s4a  and specifies a deep transformation function that maps drugs and diseases to points in the learned space termed drug and disease embeddings as diseases are not independent of each other and genes are often shared between distinct diseases the method embeds diseases associated with similar genes close together in the embedding space similarly the effects of drugs are not limited to proteins to which they directly bind but effects spread throughout the protein-protein interaction network to capture these effects the method embeds closely together drugs whose target proteins have similar local neighborhoods in the underlying protein-protein interaction network we use the learned embeddings to generate four lists of candidate drugs for covid-19 each ranked list containing 1 607 treatment recommendations to obtain the four rankings we use four distinct decoders which decode the structure of small network neighborhoods around a drug or a disease node from the learned embeddings  pipeline a1 we search for drugs that are in the vicinity of the covid-19 disease module by calculating the cosine distance between covid-19 and all drugs in the decoded embedding space 40  the decoding is based on the n  10 nearest neighboring nodes in the embedding space with a minimum distance between nodes of d  025  pipeline a2 to prevent nodes in the decoding embedding space to pack together too closely we choose d  08 and keep n unchanged pushing the structures apart into softer more general features offering a better overarching view of the embedding space at the loss of the more detailed structure  pipeline a3 alternatively to force the decoding to concentrate on the very local structure to the detriment of the overall goal of the exercise we choose n  5 to explore a smaller neighborhood while setting the minimum distance at a midrange point d  05  pipeline a4 instead of focusing on the finer local structure we specify the decoder such that it preserves the broad structure n  10 d  1 offering a broader view of the embedding space at the loss of detailed structure by inspecting the 20 highest ranked drug candidates offered by the ai-net pipeline table s4 we observe that several drugs in covid-19 clinical studies eg chloroquine ritonavir other top-ranked drugs include anti-malarial medications and drugs used to treat autoimmune pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases the predictive pipelines discussed above offered altogether twelve rankings each reflecting a different network-based criterion to estimate a drugs likelihood to show efficacy in treating covid-19 patients as they all start from the same list of drugs and drug-targets and operate on the same ppi network the rankings provided by them are not expected to be fully independent to quantify the similarity between them we measure the kendall  rank correlation of the rankings provided by each pipeline we find that two of the target proximity-based pipelines p1 and p2 show high correlation between each other as do the four ai-net pipelines a1-a4 and the five diffusion-based pipelines d1-d5 yet the correlations across the three basic methods are much lower and p3 relying on gene expression patterns is also somewhat uncorrelated with other pipelines indicating that the different methods offer complementary ranking information fig 5a  to evaluate the predictive power of the pipelines we test their ability to recover the drugs currently in clinical trials as covid-19 treatment for this purpose we obtained a list of 67 drugs currently undergoing clinical trials from clinicaltrialsgov table s5  we use the resulting list and the ranking predicted by each pipeline to compute the roc receiver operating characteristics curves and the auc area under the curve scores for model selection and performance analysis measuring the quality of separation between positive and negative instances as fig 5b shows the best individual roc curves of 086  087 are obtained by the four ai-net based methods note that the performance of the four ai-net pipelines is largely indistinguishable in line with the finding that the ranking lists provided by them are highly correlated fig 5a  the second-best performance of 070 is provided by the proximity method p3 close behind is p1 with auc  068 and we find that eliminating some drug targets in p2 decreases the auc to 058 as a group the diffusion methods offer roc between 055-056 their lower performance is somewhat unexpected as diffusion-based methods should capture higher order correlations compared to the proximity methods thus one would expect a performance between the proximity-based and the ai-net methods which successfully integrate high order correlates each method extracts its own network-based signal for prioritizing drugs however the scores of each method are biased differently offering different rankings we used a rank aggregation algorithm 9 to combine the 12 ranking lists aiming to maximize the number of pairwise agreements between the final ranking and each input ranking this objective known as the kemeny consensus is np-hard to compute 41 42  hence we used an algorithm to approximate it see methods we first tested whether combining the ranking within each method class could improve the predictive power of the list provided by the individual pipelines fig 5c  the joint performance of the ai-net group is 087 the same as a3 we do observe however an improvement for the proximity pipelines in the joint ranking increasing performance from 070 for 072 interestingly the combined diffusion pipelines have lower performance 054 than the best diffusion pipeline of 056 observed for d1 d2 and d4 what is particularly encouraging however is that when we combine all 12 pipelines we obtain a roc of 089 the highest of any individual or combination-based pipelines confirming that the individual pipelines offer complementary information that can be harnessed by the combined ranking it is this combined list therefore that defines our final ranked list of predicted drugs for repurposing finally we manually inspected the joint ranking list removing drugs with significant toxicities eliminating those not appropriate and removing lower-ranked members of the same drug class with some exceptions through this process we arrived at a list of 86 drugs selected from the top 10 of the total combined rank list representing our final repurposing candidates for covid-19  table 2  the selection contains drugs that are used for disorders of the respiratory eg theophylline montelukast and cardiovascular eg verapamil atorvastatin systems antibiotics used to treat viral eg ribavirin lopinavir parasitic eg hydroxychloroquine ivermectin praziquantel bacterial eg rifaximin sulfanilamide mycotic egfluconazole and mycobacterial eg isoniazid infections and immunomodulatinganti-inflammatory drugs eg interferon- auranofin montelukast colchicine anti-proteasomal drugs eg bortezomib carfilzomib and a range of other less obvious drugs that warrant exploration eg aminoglutethimide melatonin levothyroxine calcitriol selegiline deferoxamine mitoxantrone metformin nintedanib cinacalcet and sildenafil among others  table 2  our final list includes 11 previously proposed 1343 potential drug-repurposing candidates for covid-19 and 21 drugs that are currently being tested in clinical trials  table 2  the drug repurposing list provided in table 2 ranks drugs based on their network-based relationship to the viral targets however for a drug to be effective it may not be sufficient to be proximal-it also needs to induce the right perturbation in the cell suppressing for example the expression of proteins the virus needs and activating the expression of proteins essential for the cell function and survival that are suppressed by the virus in this section we use expression data to understand how the drug affects the activity of proteins within the covid-19 disease module offering insights about the mechanism of action of selected drugs connectivity map we retrieved gene expression perturbation profiles for 59 of the 81 repurposing candidates from the connectivity map cmap database 1011  altogether including 5 291 experimental instances combination of different drugs cell lines doses and time of treatment to evaluate the degree to which each of these drugs modulate the activity of covid-19 targets we measured the overlap between the perturbed genes and covid-19 targets for example for mitoxantrone an antineoplastic drug table 2 we find that 75 22 of the covid-19 targets have a significant overlap with the 2 440 genes highly perturbed by the drug 333m  in the lung cell line hcc515 fishers exact test fdr-bh p adj -value  005 fig 6a  when evaluated across all experimental instances we find that for 43 of the 59 drugs there was a statistically significant overlap of the perturbed genes with the covid-19 targets fig 6b  for random selections of 59 drugs from the pool of all drugs only 13  7 drugs on average have statistically significant overlap between perturbed genes and covid-19 targets fig s5  indicating that the repurposing candidates effectively perturb the network of the covid-19 disease module we observed the highest number of perturbed covid-19 targets for carfilzomib 162 p adj -value  0004  ha1e 100m  flutamide 162 p adj -value  0003 mcf7 004m  and bortezomib 162 p adjvalue  002 ha1e 200m  for cell lines derived from lung tissues a549 and hcc515 the drugs with the highest overlap with covid-19 targets are mitoxantrone and ponatinib these results can help us extract direct experimental evidence that the drug repurposing candidates selected by our methods modulate processes targeted by the virus and offer mechanistic insights into the biological processes affected by these drugs for example we find that mitoxantrone huvec 10 m  24h perturbs covid-19 targets related to cell cycle viral life cycle protein transport and organelle organization suppressing covid-19 induced expression we next asked whether the selected drugs can counteract the gene expression perturbations caused by the virus ie whether they down-regulate genes up-regulated by the virus or vice versa for this analysis we begin with the 120 differentially expressed genes degs in the sars-cov2 infected of the a549 cell line 44 and compare the list with the drug perturbation profiles for example bortezomib treatment of the cell line yapc 20 m  counteracts the effects of the sars-cov2 infection for 65 genes fig 6c  resulting in an inverted expression profile spearman correlation   058 fig 6c  we measured the spearman correlation  between the perturbations caused by the drug and perturbations caused by the virus in the a549 cell line where negative correlation values indicate that the drug could counteract the effects of the infection we find that 22 of the 59 drugs profiled in the connectivity map have negative correlation coefficients spearman   0 fdr-bh p adj -value  005 indicating that they could beneficially modulate the effects of the virus infection again for random selections of 59 drugs from the pool of all drugs only 3  2 drugs on average have statistically significant negative correlation coefficients fig s6  supporting once again the covid-19 relevance of the repurposing list among the 22 drugs with significant perturbation overlap with both covid-19 targets and degs in sars-cov2 infection we find ivermectin and carfilzomib each in clinical trial for covid-19 table s5  altogether these results provide in vitro experimental support for the selected repurposing candidates as possible modulators of the biological processes targeted by the virus it also indicates how network-based tools can utilize gene expression profiles to explore the potential efficacy of drugs in this study we took advantage of recent advances in network medicine to define a list of 81 drug repurposing candidates for the treatment of covid-19 and using in vitro data we show that these drugs do affect biological processes targeted by the virus the accuracy of our predictions will further improve as the input or validation data improve for example we relied on the results of gordon et al 2020 13  for the map of interactions between the virus and human proteins there are however additional interactions not detected in the study 13  for example the ace2 4546 protein has been recently linked to initial viral association on airway epithelial cells but in the current data set 13 no viral proteins target it note that the utilized predictive pipelines select drugs that by the virtue of the networkbased relationship between their targets and the sars-cov2 viral targets are positioned to perturb effectively the covid-19 disease module some of the perturbations may block the virus ability to invade the host cells or limit the molecular level disruption caused by the infection potentially alleviating the disease symptoms and shortening the timeline of the disease others however may cause perturbations that aggravate the symptoms and the seriousness of the phenotype therefore in ordinary circumstances we would need molecular experiments to test the efficacy of these drugs for covid-19 infected cell lines table 2  yet as many of these drugs have well-known side effects and toxicities given the imminent need for a cure it may be possible to move those drugs directly into clinical trials while we are currently pursuing this possibility releasing the list could offer opportunities for other groups with appropriate resources and toolset to move some of these drugs into screening or directly to rapid clinical trials we are of course cognizant of the remote yet real possibility that these approved drugs with known side effects may exert unique toxicities in the setting of this novel infection an outcome that can only be identified in clinical trial our study focused on ranking the existing drugs based on their expected efficacy for covid-19 patients this does not mean that drugs that did not make our final list could not have efficacy or that they must be excluded from further consideration as the input data improves other currently highly ranked drugs could move to a lower ranking developing a case for experimental testing and clinical trial and vice versa the proposed methodology is general allowing us to profile the potential efficacy of any drug or a family of drugs whether or not they are included in our current reference list normally bioinformatic validation would be followed by experimental screening and potentially clinical validation before publication we are currently pursuing these avenues from screening in human cell lines to clinical trials we feel however that given the strength of the bioinformatics validation and the obtained auc generating confidence in our methodologies and the urgency of the covid-19 crisis there is an imminent need for disclosure to offer rationale and guidance for upcoming clinical trials the human interactome was assembled from 21 public databases that compile experimentallyderived protein-protein interactions ppi data 1 binary ppis derived from high-throughput yeast-two hybrid y2h expereriments hi-union 47 56  for differentiating binary interactions among the several experimental methods present in the literature-curated databases specifically for inweb interactions with curation scores  0175 75th percentile were not considered all proteins were mapped to their corresponding entrez id ncbi and the proteins that could not be mapped were removed the final interactome used in our study contains 18 505 proteins and 327 924 interactions between them we retrieved interactions between 26 sars-cov2 proteins and 332 human proteins that were detected by gordon et al 13  and drug-target information from the drugbank database containing 26 167 interactions between 7 591 drugs and their 4 187 targets we used the gtex database 16  which contains the median gene expression from rna-seq for 56 different tissues assuming that genes with a median count lower than 5 are not expressed in that particular tissue the lcc was calculated using a degree preserving approach 2  preventing the repeated selection of the same high degree nodes by choosing 100 degree bins in 1 000 simulations given v  the set of covid-19 virus targets the set of drug targets t  and dv t the shortest path length between nodes v  v and t  t in the network we define 2 we also determined the expected distances between two randomly selected groups of proteins matching the size and degrees of the original v and t sets to avoid repeatedly selecting the same high degree nodes we use degree-binning 2 see above the mean  dvt  and standard deviation  dvt  of the reference distribution allows us to convert the absolute distance d c to a relative distance z dc  defined as the diffusion state distance dsd 8 algorithm uses a graph diffusion property to derive a similarity metric for pairs of nodes that takes into account how similarly they impact the rest of the network we calculate the expected number of times hea b that a random walk starting at node a visits node b representing each node by the vector 8 which describes how a perturbation initiated from that node impacts other nodes in the interactome the similarity between nodes a and b is provided by the l1 norm of their corresponding vector representations  inspired by the dsd we developed five new metrics to calculate the impact of drug targets t on the sars-cov2 targets v the first pipeline d1 is defined as where dsds t represents the diffusion state distance between nodes t and v since the l1 norm of two large vectors may result in loss of information 35  we also used the metric pipeline d2 and pipeline d3 where kl is the kullback-leibler kl divergence between the vector representations of the nodes t and s finally to provide symmetric measures we tested the measures pipeline d4 and pipeline d5 where js is the jensen shannon js divergence between the vector representations of nodes t and s all five measures consider t  v we designed a graph neural network for covid-19 treatment recommendations based on a previously developed graph convolutional architecture 38  the multimodal graph is a heterogeneous graph g  v r with n nodes v i  v representing three distinct types of biomedical entities ie drugs proteins diseases and labeled edges v i  r v j   r representing four semantically distinct types of edges r between the entities ie protein-protein interactions drug-target associations disease-protein associations and drug-disease treatments covid-19 treatment recommendation task we cast covid-19 treatment recommendation as a link prediction problem on the multimodal graph the task is to predict new edges between drug and disease nodes so that a predicted link between a drug node v i and a disease node v j should indicate that drug v i is a promising treatment for disease v j eg covid-19 our graph neural network is an end-to-end trainable model for link prediction on the multimodal graph and has two main components 1 an encoder a graph convolutional network operating on g and producing embeddings for nodes in g and 2 a decoder a model optimizing embeddings such that they are predictive of successful drug treatments overview of graph neural architecture the neural message passing encoder takes as input a graph g and produces a node d-dimensional embedding z i  r d for every drug and disease node in the graph we use the encoder 38 that learns a message passing algorithm 65 and aggregation procedure to compute a function of the entire graph that transforms and propagates information across graph g the graph convolutional operator takes into account the first-order neighborhood of a node and applies the same transformation across all locations in the graph successive application of these operations then effectively convolves information across the k-th order neighborhood ie embedding of a node depends on all the nodes that are at most k steps away where k is the number of successive operations of convolutional layers in the neural network model the graph convolutional operator takes the form where h is the hidden state of node v i in the k-th layer of the neural network with d k being the dimensionality of this layers representation r is an edge type matrix w k r is a edge-type specific parameter matrix  denotes a non-linear element-wise activation function ie a rectified linear unit and  r denote attention coefficients 66  to arrive at the final embedding z i  r d of node v i  we compute its representation as i  next the decoder takes node embeddings and combines them to reconstruct labeled edges in g in particular decoder scores a v i  r v j  triplet through a function g whose goal is to assign a score gv i  r v j  representing how likely it is that drugs v i will treat disease v j ie r denotes a treatment relationship training the graph neural network during model training we optimize model parameters using the max-margin loss functions to encourage the model to assign higher probabilities to successful drug indications v i  r v j  than to random drug-disease pairs we take an end-to-end optimization approach that jointly optimize over all trainable parameters and propagates loss function gradients through both encoder and the decoder to optimize the model we train it for a maximum of 100 epochs training iterations using the adam optimizer 67 with a learning rate of 0001 we initialize weights using the initialization described in 68  to make the model comparable to other drug repurposing methodologies in this study we do not integrate additional side information into node feature vectors instead we use one-hot indicator vectors 69 as node features in order for the model to generalize well to unobserved edges we apply a regular dropout 70 to hidden layer units eq 10 in practice we use efficient sparse matrix multiplications with complexity linear in the number of edges in g to implement the model we use a 2-layer neural architecture with d 1  32 d 2  32 d i  128 hidden units in input output and intermediate layer respectively a dropout rate of 01 and a max-margin of 01 we use mini-batching 71 by sampling triples from the multimodal graph that is we process multiple training mini-batches mini-batches are of size 512 each obtained by sampling only a fixed number of triplets resulting in dynamic batches that change during training we retrieved drug perturbation profiles from the connectivity map cmap database 10 11 using the python package cmappy 72  for each perturbation profile we calculated the significance of the overlap of perturbed genes z  score   2 and sars-cov2 targets derived from gordon et al 13 using fishers exact test we also retrieved gene expression data of the cell line a549 after infection with sars-cov2 44  the correlation between the perturbation scores provided in cmap and the gene expression fold change caused by sars-cov2 infection was evaluated using the spearman correlation coefficient in both cases we applied the benjamini-hochberg method for multiple testing correction fdr  005 we used crank algorithm 9 to combine rankings returned by different methodologies into a single rank for each drug which then determined the drugs repurposing priority the rank aggregation algorithm starts with ranked lists of drugs r r  each one arising from a different methodology r each ranked list is partitioned into equally sized groups called bags each bag i in ranked list r r has attached importance weight k i r whose initial values are all equal crank uses a two-stage iterative procedure to aggregate the individual rankings by taking into account uncertainty that is present across ranked lists after initializing the aggregate ranking r as a weighted average of ranked lists r r  crank alternates between the following two stages until no changes are observed in the aggregated ranking r 1 first it uses the current aggregated ranking r to update the importance weights k i r for each ranked list for that purpose the top-ranked drugs in r serve as a temporary gold standard given bag i and ranked list r r  crank updates importance weight k i r based on how many drugs from the temporary gold standard appear in bag i using the bayes factors 7374  2 second the ranked lists are re-aggregated based on the importance weights calculated in the previous stage the updated importance weights are used to revise r in which the new rank rc of drug c is expressed as indicates the importance weight of bag i r c of drug c for ranking r and r r c is the rank of c according to r by using an iterative approach crank allows for the importance of a ranking not to be predetermined and to vary across drugs the final output is a global ranked list r of drugs that represents the collective opinion of the different repurposing methodologies the python source code implementation of crank is available at httpsgithubcommims-harvardcrank in all experiments we set the number of bags to 1000 the size of the temporary gold standard to 05 of the total number of drugs in r and the maximum number of iterations to 50 in all cases the algorithm converged in fewer than 20 iterations we employed different methodologies to rank drug candidates since we lack ground-truth labels for drugs being effective against the disease we rely on clinical trials to gather names of drugs currently in trial we made an assumption that all the drugs tested in clinical trials are relevant and based on prior in vitro or in vivo observations we used this information and the ranking of each method to compute roc receiver operating characteristics curves and auc area under the curve scores for model selection and performance analysis auc score measures the quality of the separation between positive and negative instances for the ranked list we applied different thresholds to compute false-positive and true-positive rates to plot roc scores of auc range between 0 and 1 where 1 corresponds to perfect performance and 05 indicates the performance of a random classifier some methods fail to provide a ranking for each drug or to provide a fair comparison between methods we assumed all the missing ranks should be listed at the bottom of the ranking we use the python package scikit-learn 75 for computing auc scores and plotting roc curves for the ground-truth list we consider the clinicaltrialsgov website the primary source of ongoing trials of drugs fo covid-19 we are cognizant of its limitations primarily being one of time lags between the implementation of a trial and its appearance on the site we also quantified the performance of models under different

arrow is larger than expected by chance c similarly the lung-based lcc is also greater than expected by chance we measured the network proximity between covid-19 targets and 299 diseases the figure represents each disease as a circle whose radius reflects the number of disease genes associated with it 30  the diseases closest to the center whose names are marked are expected to have higher comorbidity with the covid-19 outcome the farther is a disease from the center the more distant are its disease proteins from the covid-19 viral targets table s5  c the performance of the overall

outbreak in 2019 researchers are trying to find effective drugs against the sars-cov-2 virus based on de novo drug design and drug repurposing while the former approach is very time-consuming and needs extensive testing in humans drug repurposing is more promising as the drugs have already been tested for side-effects etc currently there is no treatment for covid-19 that is clinically effective but there is a huge amount of data from studies that analyze potential drugs we developed cordite to efficiently combine state-of-the-art knowledge on potential drugs and make it accessible

available at httpscorditemathematikuni-marburgde  cordite aggregates all available knowledge on potential drugs for sars-cov-2  cordite represents the largest curated database for drugs and interactions  cordite makes the data accessible via a webserver and an open api  cordite support researchers for meta-analyses design of new clinical studies or literature search  coronaviruses can cause major outbreaks with fatal pneumonia eg the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 with a fatality rate of around 10 lee et al 2003 or the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 with a fatality rate of 35 de groot et al 2013  in 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused the disease covid-19 and led to a pandemic zhu et al 2020  the common symptoms of covid-19 include fever cough shortness of breath and dyspnea a more severe progression of the covid-19 disease may lead to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndromes unfortunately there are no specific drugs or vaccines approved for the treatment of covid-19 yet huang et al 2020  traditionally de novo drug design and drug repurposing are the common strategies scientists use to combat viral diseases however designing a new drug is very time-consuming and needs extensive testing before clinical use in humans in contrast the repurposing of approved drugs or drugs in clinical trials is more promising in particular since these have already been tested for side-effects toxicity bioavailability etc at the moment there is a huge amount of data from studies that analyze potential drugs based on computer simulations in vitro studies case studies or clinical trials however none of the proposed treatments for covid-19 have been proven to be clinically effective yet potential drugs can target viral proteins or human proteins at the time of writing the most important viral target molecules that have been investigated for drug repurposing are sars-cov-2 spike protein main protease 3clpro mpro papain-like proteinase plpro and rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp out et al 2020 zhang et al 2020  while the main targets on the human cell membrane are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 aronson and ferner 2020  besides these targets several other candidates have been investigated as potential targets such investigations occurred on both viral and human sides eg the methyltransferase and furin respectively bestle et al 2020 khan et al 2020  also several potential drugs were announced at the beginning of the pandemic which later proved to be insufficiently effective or even harmful to patients such as hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate for instance gautret et al 2020 reported a significant decrease in viral load in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to controls however others have shown that these potential drugs can have severe side effects such as cardiac toxicity and also increased mortality mehra et al 2020  nevertheless some of those studies showing higher mortality were later retracted because of a lack of transparency concerning the data mehra et al 2020b  other potential drug candidates such as a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir also known as kaletra was first considered a promising candidate jeon et al 2020 but later shown to be ineffective for sars-cov-2 cao et al 2020  nevertheless many new drug candidates have been proposed by using different computational approaches which address different viral and human targets it is expressed as a membrane-bound protein in the lungs heart kidneys stomach spleen intestine bone marrow kidney liver brain testis and placenta shenoy et al 2011 donoghue et al 2020 soler et al 2020  moreover hoffmann et al 2020 showed that sars-cov-2 depends on tmprss2 which therefore can serve as a target in therapy as well tmprss2 primes the spike protein of sars-cov-2 to enable cell-entry on ace2 the authors further suggested that ace-2 binding to the spike protein might have a higher affinity compared to sars this may explain the infection of the upper respiratory system by sars-cov-2 which has not been observed in sars since in the upper respiratory system less ace2 is expressed structurally each virion is approximately 50-200 nm in diameter chen et al 2020  like other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 has four structural polyproteins known as the s spike e envelope m membrane and n nucleocapsid proteins the latter n protein holds the rna genome while the s e and m proteins together are part of the viral envelope upon successful attachment of the virus to the membrane of the host cell via the spike protein the virus fuses with the membrane wu et al 2020  hoffmann et al 2020  next the endosome sees a drop of ph and the genomic rnass is released into the cells cytoplasm yang et al 2004  as shown in figure 1 the knowledge from the life cycle of the sars-cov-2 virus offers a great potential to find suitable drugs for the already known targets to combine the large amounts of current knowledge we centralize the aggregated information from published articles and

covid19 treatment by repurposing drugs until the vaccine is in sight mrudula phadke sujata saunik   on the backdrop of novel coronavirus covid19sarscov2 creating a pandemic situation and creating some desertion of the city of wuhan china the epicenter it is an emergent need that the medical and scientific community undertake quick measures this virus has made social political economic financial medical and scientific fraternity to go in a state of emergency the spread of the virus has been as fast as the dissemination of fear and false news rapid isolation measures taken have restricted the spread yet it may be premature to say if they were delayed who declared coronavirus disease covid19 outbreak as pandemic on march 12 2020 the virus responsible for covid19 disease is sarscov2 it was on february 11 2020 that the international committee on taxonomy of viruses announced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as the name of this new virus earlier called novel coronavirus ncov coronavirus belongs to the family of coronaviridae in the order nidovirales there are four groups of coronaviruses zhu  zhang 2020 alphacoronaviruses infect mammals human coronavirus nl63 betacoronaviruses infect mammals sars cov mers cov bat cov gammacoronaviruses infect birds avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus deltacoronaviruses infect both birds and mammals porcein delta cov four viruses 229 e alpha uc 43 beta nl 63 alpha and hku1 beta cause common cold symptoms covid19 is a betacoronavirus zhu  zhang 2020 bat coronavirus hku4 is also a betacoronavirus it is a large 2732 kb enveloped positivestranded rna virus its viral genome is packed inside a helical capsid formed by nucleocapsid protein and is surrounded by an envelope the virus has four proteins membrane protein m envelope protein e spike protein s and nucleocapsid protein n spike forms large protrusions on viral surface giving it a crownlike appearance and hence the name corona spike protein mediates the entry of the virus into host cells lellan  wrapp 2020 it is also the critical determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism and is a major inducer of host immune response li 2016 spike protein is in charge of receptor binding and subsequent viral entry into the host cells therefore it can be the major therapeutic target it binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp 4 or cd 26 the former is more for sars and the latter is for mers cd 209 l is the alternative receptor with lower affinity to respiratory tract song et al 2019 scientists wan shang graham baric  li 2020 have analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019ncov based on the knowledge on sequencing of sarscov they have found that the sequence of 2019 ncov receptor binding motif rbm that directly contacts ace2 receptor is similar to that of sarscov and suggest that 2019ncov wuhan uses ace2 as its receptor their structural analysis predicted that the wuhan coronavirus uses ace2 as its host receptor they have further stated that a single mutation significantly enhances the ability of ncov wuhan to bind with human ace2 zhu  zhang 2020 spike protein has s1 and s2 subunits a minimal receptorbinding domain rbd is located in the s1 subunit and can combine with host cell receptor ace2 on the rbd rbm is located which is responsible for complete contact with ace2 there is no definite treatment for covid19 the most important method is to prevent viral transmission by rapid isolation and disease containment measures as the spread of covid19 is mainly respiratory in origin by droplet infection utmost care is required with the use of personal protective gadgets masks assessment and notification of true picture and prevention of spread by controlling travel and isolation screening of individuals and so forth treatment of pneumonia and acute lung injury is largely empiric there is an urgent need to device and develop various treatment modalities in the form of vaccine newer drug molecules or repurpose some of the existing drugs the health care community and biotech industry need to take an urgent call and undertake quick clinical trials on humanitarian grounds various modalities of treatment can be triedantiviral drugsviral polymerases and protease inhibitors which are components of the hiv and hcv antiviral regimen find an immediate place lopinavir and ritonavir which are protease inhibitors and oseltamivir neuraminidase are under study remdesivir which interferes with viral polymerase can be tried it has shown efficacy against mers wan et al 2020vaccine trials need to be started antibodies raised against the s1 subunit can be protective so can antibodies against the rbd fragment spike proteinbased vaccine will also produce antibodies and will offer protection passive antibody transfer from convalescent sera of recovered patients will have polyclonal antibodies and their plasma can be transfused a new idea of target viral receptor protein on cell surface ace2 and rbd protein can be attached to an fc fragment and can be used to attack the virus extracellular domain of ace2 protein fused to a human immunoglobulin g fc domain may hold promise david fedson 2016 ace2 fc fusion protein against covid may neutralize the virus and prevent lung injury it can also be used to give passive immunity to health care workers all these are still highly experimental an interesting paper hoffmann et al 2020 mentions the use of a drug called camostat acting on tmprss 2 protein which could prevent viral entry as the virus uses the proteinbased on the structure of the virus the presence of ace2 as the receptor which facilitates entry of the virus and based on work done in sars ards and sepsis by fedson 2016 some treatments can be hypothesized a large body of experimental and clinical research done on treating patients with pneumonia ards sepsis influenza and ebola with lung injury suggest that statins and angiotensin receptor blockers might be effective in covid19 infection statins are known to have lipidlowering and also antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory activities on cytokines chemokines complement cascade and coagulation factors thus the host response to covid19 resulting in lung injury may be controlled with the use of statins hypercytokinemia is not directly associated with viral replication but it can be variability in host response early use of statins could prove beneficial other antiinflammatory drugs can be used chloroquine is being tried toowe also hypothesize that the use of angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb available for clinical use as antihypertensives can be potential drugs to be given for control of viral spread of novel coronavirus wuhan infection an unpublished observation by one of us mp is that people using losartan or telmisartan arb as antihypertensives get fewer attacks of cold and flulike illnesses both these drugs also do not produce cough as the side effect so commonly seen with ace inhibitors losartan and telmisartan strongly binds to the at1 receptors more than valsartan phadke  saunik 2020 therefore the use of the former could be suitable in the treatment of coronavirus disease the mode of administration in addition to being given orally could be in the form of a nasal spray published literature is scant on this information clinicians and scientists may consider the use of losartan or telmisartan in therapeutic doses for preventing the virus entering the host cell and spread of infection rapid clinical trials are the need of the hour in mice experimentally infected with h5n1 influenza treatment with arb losartan improved survival kruse 2020
 the use of zinc supplement can help intracellular killing and phagocytosis and can modulate immune function and may be tried thus the use of arb telmisartan and losartan to be given in therapeutic doses along with zinc to control viral replication warrants attention ace2 receptors are widely expressed on epithelial cells of alveoli trancheobronchial free and may help virus entry song et al 2019 therefore the use of arbs in the form of nebulization can be tried developing scientific treatment that will target the viruses in the form of vaccines and new molecules is a topdown approach but can be timeconsuming though eventually required however one can think of a bottomup approach by repurposing commonly used lowcost generic drugs such as arb zinc in controlling viral multiplication and statins to control lung injury this if found useful can make an immeasurable contribution to global health equity and global viral security conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest  computational insights into tetracyclines as inhibitors against sars-cov-2 mpro via combinatorial molecular simulation calculations shiv bharadwaj kyung lee eun vivek dwivedi dhar sang kang gu   human coronaviruses hcovs such as middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov also called as sars-cov-2 that emerged from animal reservoirs have aggravate the pandemic with high mortality and morbidity coronaviruses covs are positive-sense single-stranded rna ssrna virus which contain the largest rna genome of 2732 kb with six to ten open reading frames orfs enclosed in an enveloped protein to form spherical particles of 100160 nm size 12 the genetic material of hcovs is highly susceptible to frequent recombination process which has been suggested to direct the establishment of new hcov strains with altered virulence 3 as a result a total of seven main hcovs have been recorded viz hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 these viruses are held accountable for fatal infections in the respiratory system and other system symptoms including diarrhea and nausea 45 hcovs belong to the coronaviridae family of the order nidovirales and classified into four genera    and  6 recently discovered sars-cov-2 belongs to the  genus which shares 795 sequence similarity to sars-related coronavirus and is 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus 78 the genome analysis of coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 genome genbankmn9089473 revealed four non-structural proteins ie papain-like protease plpro 3-chymotrypsin-like 3clpro helicase and rna polymerase four structural proteins viz nucleocapsid n protein membrane m protein envelope e protein spike s protein and accessory proteins 19 10 11 both 3clpro and plpro are reported in transcription and replication of the virus 6 remarkably in vitro inhibition of these proteases by the selected inhibitors has shown antiviral activity against coronaviruses covs 1213 these observations concluded the 3clpro as the main coronavirus protease mpro 14 which is essentially required to conduct the replication cycle of the virus 615 like in other hcovs sars-cov-2 mpro digests the polyprotein at conserved sites it starts with autolytic cleavage from pp1a and pp1ab site encoded by the virus orf1ab which shares 96 sequence similarity with mpro of sars-cov strain 1617 to conquer coronavirus infections the inhibition of viral mpro which is functionally important in the viral life cycle and absence of its human homologues has been approved as conventional antiviral therapeutic strategy 12 in current scenario despite numerous efforts no drug or vaccine is yet approved against the hcovs and expected to take further months to years for the new interventions 11 recently various mpro inhibitors were demonstrated for broad-spectrum in vitro activities against covs via interacting with conserved key residues required for the substrate recognition at respective mpro enzymes 1819 moreover with the urgency of sars-cov-2 outbreak drug repurposing is represented as an effective drug discovery approach from existing drugs to suggestively shorten the time and condense the cost by comparison to de novodrug discovery strategy and randomized clinical trials 20 to facilitate the rapid drug discovery computational drug repurposing approaches have been established as an effective method to reveal the new indications from already known drugs with the aid of computational algorithms such as molecular docking simulation and molecular dynamics simulation to predict the drug-target interactions and binding stability respectively 2122 previously computational drug repurposing approaches were employed to identify the potential drug candidates against viral infections including ebola zika dengue and influenza infections 23 and for hcovs such as sars-cov and mers-cov 24 25 26 also nonpeptidic active-site-directed inhibition of sars-cov mpro was discovered by a combination of screening and docking methods 27 likewise bifunctional aryl boronic acid compounds were discovered to inhibit the sars-cov mpro using combination of experimental and computational methods 28 after sars-cov-2 outbreak computational drug repurposing was also applied to find the potential drugs and some of the investigations are already reported 29 30 31 in area of drug repurposing antibiotics from tetracyclines and its derivatives have been repurposed against viral infections 3233 these antibiotics are well designated as broad-spectrum bacteriostatic inhibitors which selectively inhibit the microbial protein synthesis only including naturally occurring polyketide compounds chlortetracycline oxytetracycline and tetracycline and their semisynthetic derivatives minocycline doxycycline and methacycline 32 notably tetracycline derivatives ie doxycycline was reported to exert antiviral effects against antimurine retrovirus 34 chikungunya infection 33 and blockage of dengue virus replication in infected cell lines 3536 besides demeclocycline is known to exert anti-viral activity on west nile virus wnv 37 and included in the list of antiviral compounds 38 another broad spectrum tetracycline derivative minocycline was initially reported against human immunodeficiency virus hiv type 1 infection 39 and later studied for other viruses such as wnv japanese encephalitis virus jev simian immunodeficiency virus siv sindbis human t-lymphocytic virus type-1 htlv-1 rabies and reoviruses 40 moreover tetracyclines eg tetracycline doxycycline and minocycline which are known as zinc chelating agents were postulated to inhibit covid-19 infection by restricting viral replication in the host 41 additionally synthetic halogenated tetracycline eravacycline was demonstrated with inhibitory effect against sars-cov sars-cov-2 mers-cov and hepatitis c virus hcv using computational studies 42 hence under the impression of tetracyclines and their derivatives inhibits viral infections we hypothesized that antibiotics reported for antiviral activities may be helpful in the sars-cov-2 inhibition by blockage of its main protease viz mpro thereof we employed structure based molecular docking for selected four tetracyclines ie doxycycline tetracycline demeclocycline and minocycline known for antiviral activities against other viruses with mpro from sars-cov-2 similar virtual screening approach was recently applied to identify the tetracycline derivatives as flavivirus inhibitors 36 following docked protein-antibiotics complexes were evaluated for the complex stability via classical molecular dynamics simulation the binding affinity and stability of selected viral protease-antibiotics complexes were also compared to the docked complexes of protease with native ligand n3 inhibitor to generate a comparative study as mentioned in fig 1

mpro and atoms of tetracycline fig 2cd similarly sars-cov-2 mpro-demeclocycline complex exhibited significant docking score of 74 kcalmol along with formation of three hydrogen bonds at essential residues asn142 303  gly143 280  and gln189 374  of sars-cov-2 mpro additionally the respective complex was noted for hydrophobic interactions leu27 met49 leu141 cys145 and met165 polar interactions

mpro-minocycline complex showed substantial binding energy of 71 kcalmol followed by formation of three hydrogen bonds with the residues asn142 264  gly143 254  and glu166 284  in the active pocket of viral protease other intermolecular interactions viz hydrophobic interactions leu27 met49 pro52 tyr54 leu141 cys145 and met165 polar interactions thr25 thr26 his41 ser46 asn142 ser144 his164 and gln189 negative interactions glu166 and asp187 positive interactions arg188 and glycine interactions gly143 were also observed for sars-cov-2 mpro-minocycline docked complex fig 2gh the substantial docking energy and formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the atoms of respective antibiotics with active residues of sars-cov-2 mpro indicate the substantial stability of docked protease-antibiotics complexes furthermore the docked poses of the antibiotics with sars-cov-2 mpro were also compared to the sars-cov-2 mpro-n3 inhibitor docked complex fig s2 the comparative docking analysis includes docking energy and intermolecular interaction profiling between the selected complexes from molecular docking simulation analysis n3 inhibitor 76 kcalmol showed relatively similar docking energy by comparison to selected antibiotics maximum docking score 76 kcalmol logged for sars-cov-2 mpro-doxycycline complex moreover sars-cov-2 mpro-n3 inhibitor complex exhibited formation of four hydrogen bonds with residues cys145 201  glu166 216  and gln189 230 and 306  along with other intermolecular interactions fig s2 interestingly in sars-cov-2 mpro-antibiotic complexes doxycycline also generated five hydrogen bonds and minimum of three hydrogen bonds were noted for the minocycline docked at the active pocket of viral protease besides both antibiotics and n3 inhibitor exhibited significant hydrophobic polar negative positive and glycine interactions with common residues of the sars-cov-2 mpro figs 2 s2 interestingly selected antibiotics docked with

inhibitors 43 as the antibiotics were logged for intermolecular interaction with residues of active site and substrate-binding pocket located between the clefts of domain i and domain ii of vial main protease suggested to inhibit the proteolytic function of sars-cov-2 mpro which is required for the viral replication and pathogenesis 43 moreover interacted residues of sars-cov-2 mpro in the antibiotics docked complexes are highly conserved as substrate-recognition pocket of the covs suggested the selected screened antibiotics can be employed for the development of broad spectrum of antiviral drugs against hcovs hence molecular docking simulation analysis for the screened antibiotics with respect to n3 inhibitor suggested that the selected drug molecules have the potential to inhibit sars-cov-2 mpro by interacting with its catalytic dyad and substrate binding residues to quantify the degree of conformational changes in protein and ligand of the docked complexes initially rmsd for protein c backbone side-chain and heavy and fit ligand on protein were calculated from 100 ns simulation trajectories for each complex the c atoms of sars-cov-2 mpro docked with selected antibiotics and n3 inhibitor showed acceptable fluctuations mean  180 to 211  with equilibration till end of simulation figs 3
 s5 likewise backbone side-chain and heavy atoms of sars-cov-2 mpro from respective complexes were noted for stable deviations 3  except for receptor complex with tetracycline 45  showed fluctuation around 2040 ns followed by state of equilibrium till end of 100 ns simulation fig s6 besides rmsd of the four antibiotics fit on protein exhibited acceptable deviations fig 3 notably tetracycline and minocycline showed maximum variation 105  between 40 and 60 ns interval followed by equilibrium at 58  and 22  respectively at the end of 100 ns simulation fig 3 while rmsd for the n3 inhibitor fit on protein showed variations 6  between 40 and 60 ns and then higher deviations 9-18  after 80 ns till end of 100 ns interval fig s5 these results indicate that antibiotics docked protease complexes have attained the equilibrium during 100 ns simulation while n3 inhibitor docked complex required longer simulation interval to achieve the complex stability thereof based on mean of the rmsd trajectories the selected antibiotics were concluded with significant complex stability by comparison to n3 inhibitor docked with sars-cov-2 mpro furthermore flexibility of sars-cov-2 mpro docked with selected compounds was analyzed to monitor the deviations in the protein residues and ligand atoms during simulation fig s7 in all the complexes acceptable rmsf values for the protein residues were recorded with respect to time where residues on the n-terminal 2  exhibited low fluctuation compared to the c-terminal last 10 residues with variation of 45  besides ligands were also monitored to have significant contacts with the residues in -strands containing active pocket of the protein supports the integration of the docked ligands with residues on the active region of sars-cov-2 mpro fig s7 moreover intermolecular interactions of the ligands with secondary structure elements -helices and -strands of the protein indicate induction of slight rigidity in the protein structure hence these acceptable rmsf values for protein structure and residue-ligand contact mapping suggested the structural stability of sars-cov-2 mpro complexes with antibiotics by comparison to native ligand n3 inhibitor of crystal structure during 100 ns simulation likewise rmsf calculated for the selected antibiotics fit on sars-cov-2 mpro with respect to simulation time suggested the acceptable deviations 35  in mean structure of the ligand expect for tetracycline atoms at position 19 to 28 and minocycline atoms at position 19 to 28 fig s8 these variations in heteroatoms of the ligands were also concluded to contribute in relatively higher ligand fit on protein rmsd against other antibiotics during simulation furthermore rmsf calculated for the n3 inhibitor fit on sars-cov-2 mpro exhibited higher deviations 510  fig s8 which were suggested to contribute higher rmsd in the fit ligand on protein during md simulation fig s5 in conclusion rmsd and rmsf indicate the acceptable changes in the antibiotics docked sars-cov-2 mpro complexes by comparison to sars-cov-2 mpro-n3 inhibitor during 100 ns md simulations the protein sse -helices and -strands were monitored for sse distribution and sse composition analysis for the respective residue index during the simulation to observed changes in the domains of sars-cov-2 mpro docked with respective ligands fig s9 the selected complexes of sars-cov-2 mpro with antibiotics and n3 inhibitor exhibited only -helix structures in the c-terminal region 201303 which formed the domain iii of the viral protease while n-terminal region showed both -helices and -strands 1200 which constitute the domain i and domain iii for the viral protease defined in the crystal structure for the formation of active pocket 43 these observations concluded the secondary structure of sars-cov-2 mpro complexed with all the selected ligands total sse  45  12 interestingly -strand total 25  11 secondary structures in the active pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro were monitored to be significantly occupied by selected antibiotics and n3 inhibitor fig s9 furthermore torsion angle potential plot was also studied for all the selected ligands which exhibits the relation between the torsion angle of the respective ligands to their respective potential energy 49 the torsion angle provides the necessary information for the number of rotatable bonds in the ligand molecule fig s10 here doxycycline tetracycline demeclocycline minocycline and n3 inhibitor were predicted with 6 6 7 6 and 22 rotatable bonds in their structures the torsion potential and histogram relationships provide a standard method to get an insight into the conformational strain introduced in the ligands during simulation which assisted to understand the protein-bound ligand conformation these results indicate that ligand with a smaller number of rotatable bonds showed stronger rigidity and vice-versa may contribute to generate optimum geometry for the ligand in the active pocket to attained higher stability this can be correlated with the docking score and number for intermolecular interactions in the respective docked complexes figs 2 s2 moreover modifications introduced in the fit ligand on protein during md simulation were also calculated in terms of ligand rmsd radius of gyration intra-molecular hydrogen bonds molecular surface area molsa solvent accessible surface area sasa and polar surface area psa fig s11 these results suggested the stability of selected antibiotics at the active pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by comparison to n3 inhibitor the binding mode of ligand with the active pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro can be further analyzed for the atomic level interactions which includes hydrogen bond formation hydrophobic contact ionic interaction and salt bridge formation during md simulation hence these protein-ligand interactions were extracted from 100 ns simulation trajectories to support the respective complex stability during md simulation all the antibiotics by comparison to n3 inhibitor showed significant interactions with the essential catalytic residues ie his41 and cys145 in addition to other substrate binding residues in the active pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro figs 4
 s12 these residues were also recorded for the intermolecular interaction with the ligands during molecular docking simulation figs 2 s2 interestingly all the antibiotics were observed for higher number of interactions with residues in protein-ligand mapping and formation of hydrogen bond with active residues of the protein for 30 of the simulation interval with an exception in sars-cov-2 mpro-tetracycline complex fig 4 however only asn142 and glu166 were predicted with substantial hydrogen boning and water bridges formation in sars-cov-2 mpro-n3 inhibitor complex from protein-ligand interaction mapping data analysis fig s12 furthermore total number of contacts and their density with respect to time were also calculated fig s13 again these plots suggested the multiple interactions of the selected antibiotics by comparison to n3 inhibitor with the essential residues his41 asn142 gly143 cys145 glu166 and gln189 in the active pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro these observations suggested the substantial protein-ligand intermolecular interactions and stability of four antibiotics by comparison to n3 inhibitor throughout the 100 ns md simulations hence based on docking score and simulation trajectory analysis selected four antibiotics are predicted as potential sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitor in the order viz doxycycline minocycline demeclocycline and tetracycline to challenge the sars-cov-2 infection by comparison to n3 inhibitor recently combinational therapy of lopinavir with the other potent compounds against sars-cov-2 virus has been suggested to increase synergy and decrease the effective concentration of lopinavir 50 for instance triple antiviral therapy composed of interferon -1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin against sars-cov-2 mpro was reported as superior and safe against lopinavirritonavir alone to reduce the virus shedding lessening symptoms and facilitating discharge of infected patients with mild to moderate degree of sars-cov-2 infection 51 in this regard based on our computational studies the selected antibiotics ie doxycycline minocycline demeclocycline and tetracycline may be helpful as combinational therapy with lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin against sars-cov-2 infection this study was aimed to repurpose the antibiotics with known anti-viral activity as potential inhibitor against sars-cov-2 mpro with the aid of molecular simulation approaches a total of four potent antibiotics viz doxycycline tetracycline demeclocycline and minocycline were evaluated as sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitor by comparison to native ligand of sars-cov-2 mpro crystal structure n3 inhibitor molecular docking simulation for the selected antibiotics showed docking score 7 kcalmol and interaction with catalytic dyad of sars-cov-2 mpro ie his41 and cys145 these complexes were further analyzed for structural stability by 100 ns classical molecular dynamics simulation suggested the considerable stability of sars-cov-2 mpro docked complexes with antibiotics by comparison to n3 inhibitor of sars-cov-2 mpro via strong multiple intermolecular interactions from the binding mode analysis before and after molecular dynamics simulation analysis followed by interaction profiles collected during the simulation interval supported the selected antibiotics for substantial stability on the active pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro in conclusion based on docking score and molecular dynamics simulation trajectory analysis selected four antibiotics can be used as potential sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitor in the order viz doxycycline minocycline demeclocycline and tetracycline to challenge the sars-cov-2 infection hence the screened and computationally validated antibiotics can be further evaluated for in vitro sars-cov-2 mpro inhibition and viral infection as single dose or in synergistic concentrations for the drug development and combinational therapy against sars-cov-2 infection  a data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting covid-19 yiyue ge tingzhong tian suling huang fangping wan jingxin li shuya li hui yang hong lixiang nian wu enming yuan lili cheng yipin lei hantao shu xiaolong feng ziyuan jiang ying chi xiling guo lunbiao cui liang xiao zeng li chunhao yang zehong miao haidong tang ligong chen hainian zeng dan zhao fengcai zhu xiaokun shen jianyang zeng  the global spread of sars-cov-2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of covid-19 we developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against sars-cov-2 the retrospective study using the past sars-cov and mers-cov data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-adp-ribose polymerase 1 parp1 inhibitor cvl218 currently in phase i clinical trial may be repurposed to treat covid-19 our in vitro assays revealed that cvl218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect in addition we showed that cvl218 is able to suppress the cpg-induced il-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by sars-cov-2 infection further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of cvl218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 infection moreover molecular docking simulation suggested that cvl218 may bind to the n-terminal domain of nucleocapsid n protein of sars-cov-2 providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action we also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of parp1 inhibitors against sars-cov-2 based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature in summary the parp1 inhibitor cvl218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of covid-19  the outbreak of the pneumonia named covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 2019-ncov has infected over 110000 people worldwide by 8th march 2020 apart from china other countries or regions including south korea iran and europe have reported a rapid increase in the number of covid-19 cases implying that this novel coronavirus has posed a global health threat under the current circumstance of the absence of the specific vaccines and medicines against sars-cov-2 it is urgent to discover effective therapies especially drugs to treat the resulting covid-19 disease and prevent the virus from further spreading considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy ie finding the new uses of old drugs 1 2 3 to identify the potential antiviral effects against sars-cov-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials those existing drugs with potent antiviral efficacy can be directly applied to treat covid-19 in a short time as their safety has been verified in principle in clinical trials in this study we applied a data-driven framework that combines both machine learning and statistical analysis methods to systematically integrate large-scale available coronavirus-related data and identify the drug candidates against sars-cov-2 from a set of over 6000 drug candidates mainly including approved investigational and experimental drugs our in silico screening process followed by experimental validation revealed that a poly-adp-ribose polymerase 1 parp1 inhibitor cvl218 currently in phase i clinical trial may serve as a potential drug candidate to treat our in vitro assays demonstrated that cvl218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner and with no obvious cytopathic effect in addition we found that in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs cvl218 is able to suppress the cpg-induced production of il-6 which has been reported previously to be of high relevance to the viral pathogenesis of covid-19 especially for those intensive care unit icu patients infected by sars-cov-2 further in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies in rats and monkeys showed that cvl218 was highly distributed in the lung tissue and no apparent sign of toxicity was observed which makes it an appealing potential drug candidate for the treatment of the novel pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 infection moreover our molecular docking study suggested that cvl218 may bind to the n-terminal domain of nucleocapsid n protein of sars-cov-2 providing a possible mode of its antiviral action against sars-cov-2 based on the data present in this study and previous known evidences reported in the literature we also discussed several putative mechanisms of the anti-sars-cov-2 effects for cvl218 or other parp1 inhibitors to be involved in the treatment of covid-19 overall our results indicated that the parp1 inhibitor cvl218 identified by our drug repositioning pipeline may serve as an effective therapeutic agent against covid-19 the overview of our data-driven drug repositioning framework is shown in figure 1a  we first constructed a virus related knowledge graph consisting of drug-target interactions protein-protein interactions and similarity networks from publically available databases methods three different types of nodes ie drugs human targets and virus targets within the knowledge graph were connected through edges describing their interactions associations or similarities to establish bridges of information aggregation and knowledge mining we then applied a network-based knowledge mining algorithm to predict an initial list of drug candidates that can be potentially used to treat sars-cov-2 infection  figure 1b and methods next we further narrowed down the list of drug candidates with the previously reported evidences of antiviral activities based on the text mining results from the large-scale literature texts which were derived through a deep learning based relation extraction method named bere 4  figure 1c and methods followed by a minimum of manual checking after that we used the connectivity map analysis approach 5 with the gene expression profiles of ten sars-cov-infected patients 6 to further refine the list of drug candidates against sars-cov-2  figure 1d  table 1 table s1 and methods the above screening process revealed that a poly-adp-ribose polymerase 1 parp1 inhibitor pj-34 could potentially have the antiviral activities against sars-cov-2 to demonstrate that our computational pipeline for drug repositioning can yield reasonably accurate prediction results we also validated our network-based knowledge mining algorithm  figure 1b using the retrospective data of the two coronaviruses that are closely related to sars-cov-2 and had been relatively well studied in the literature ie sars-cov and mers-cov with the aid of our developed text mining tool bere we found that many of the drugs that had been reported previously in the literature to have antiviral activities against the corresponding coronavirus were also among the top list of our predicted results  table 2  for example chloroquine an fda-approved drug for treating malaria 7  which was previously reported to exhibit micromolar anti-sars-cov activity in vitro 8  was also repurposed for targeting the same virus by our prediction framework gemcitabine which was originally approved for treating certain types of cancers 9  was also predicted for targeting sars-cov with validation by previous in vitro studies 10  cyclosporine a calcineurin inhibitor approved as an immunomodulatory drug 11  was observed to block the replication of sars-cov 12  and also successfully predicted by our approach among the predicted top list for mers-cov miltefosine which was approved for treating leishmaniasis 13  was previously identified to have anti-mers-cov activity 14  chlorpromazine and imatinib which were used for treating schizophrenia 15 and leukemia 16  respectively were also selected by our computational pipeline as anti-mers-cov drugs and can be validated by previous in vitro experiments 10  thus the above retrospective study illustrated that our computational framework is able to predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus as pj-34 is still currently in the pre-clinical trial stage drugbank id db08348 17  we selected two parp1 inhibitors including olaparib and mefuparib hydrochloride cvl218  figure s1  that are currently fda-approved and at phase i clinical trial respectively for our initial study we first conducted a pilot experimental test in vitro methods on the anti-sars-cov-2 activities of olaparib cvl218 and several other related drugs figure 2a  we found that both parp1 inhibitors olaparib and cvl218 exhibited inhibitory effects against sars-cov-2 replication nevertheless cvl218 showed a much higher inhibition rate than olaparib more specifically olaparib inhibited sars-cov-2 replication by 1548 at a concentration of 32 m while cvl218 reached 3516 reduction at a concentration of 3 m notably the antiviral efficacy of cvl218 even surpassed arbidol which is one of the standard treatments for covid-19 in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 6 promulgated by the chinese government httpwwwnhcgovcnyzygjs7653p2020028334a8326dd94d329df 351d7da8aefc2filesb218cfeb1bc54639af227f922bf6b817pdf in particular arbidol inhibited sars-cov-2 replication by 2173 at 3 m much lower than that of cvl218 at the same concentration  figure 2a  in contrast oseltamivir zanamivir drugs used for preventing influenza virus infection and baricitinib jak12 inhibitor which was recommended in 18 to treat showed no inhibitory activities against sars-cov-2 at the concentration of 3 m or 32 m based on the above pilot experimental results we then chose cvl218 for subsequent experimental studies our further in vitro assays methods showed that cvl218 exhibited effective inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner with an ec 50 of 512 m  figure 2b  we also assessed the cytotoxicity of cvl218 by the cck8 assay methods and found that cvl218 had a cc 50 to systematically assess the inhibitory activities of cvl218 against sars-cov-2 we also performed a time-of-addition assay methods to determine at which stage cvl218 inhibits viral infection remdesivir which has entered the clinical trials for the treatment of covid-19 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct0425765 6 was also tested in this assay for comparison in particular as compared to the dmso control group both cvl218 and remdesivir showed potent antiviral activities during the full-time procedure of the sars-cov-2 infection in vero e6 cells figure 2d  the results of the time-of-addition assay indicated that cvl218 can partially work against the viral entry and significantly inhibit the replication of virus post-entry while the remdesivir can only function at the post-entry stage  figure 2d  2e all together the results of these in vitro assays indicated that cvl218 can be further evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent for treating covid-19 recently it has become evident that interleukin-6 il-6 is one of the most important cytokines during viral infection 19  and emerging clinical studies in humans and animals have linked the excessive synthesis of il-6 with the persistence of many viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv 20  foot and mouth disease virus 21 and vesicular stomatitis virus vsv 22  in addition an in vivo study in the friend retrovirus fv mouse model showed that il-6 blockage can reduce viral loads and enhance virus-specific cd8 t-cell immunity 23  these findings supported a hypothesis that rapid production of il-6 might be a possible mechanism leading to the deleterious clinical manifestations in viral pathogenesis 24  recently published researches on the clinical characteristics of severe patients with sars-cov-2 infection showed that il-6 was significantly elevated especially in those icu patients which caused excessive activated immune response 25 26 27 28 29  the pathological role of il-6 in sars-cov-2 infection indicated that il-6 blockade may provide a feasible therapy for the treatment of covid-19 to test whether cvl218 is able to regulate the il-6 production in vitro we stimulated the il-6 production of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells pmbcs by cpg-odn 1826 which is an effective stimulator of cytokines and chemokines incubation of pbmcs with 1 m cpg-odn 1826 for 6 h methods induced il-6 production by 40 when compared to untreated cells  figure 3  in the presence of cvl218 the stimulatory effect of cpg-odn 1826 was counteracted further study showed that cvl218 inhibited the cpg-induced il-6 upregulation in a time-and dose-dependent manner  figure 3  more specifically exposure with cvl218 at concentrations 1 m and 3 m for 12 h attenuated the cpg-induced il-6 production by 50 and 7265 respectively these results provided an in vitro evidence to support cvl218 as a potential therapeutic agent for treating pro-inflammatory response caused by sars-cov-2 infection table s2  which was also previously reported in 30  among seven tissues ie lung spleen liver kidney stomach heart and brain we observed that lung had the highest cvl218 concentration which was 188-fold higher compared to that of plasma  table 3  the observation that lung had the highest concentration of cvl218 was in line with the fact that the sars-cov-2 virus has the most pathological impact in lung with high viral loads which suggested that cvl218 has the potential to be used for the indications of the lung lesions caused by sars-cov-2 infection if its antiviral profile can be established in animal models and clinical trials furthermore we compared the pharmacokinetic data between cvl218 and arbidol a broad-spectrum antiviral drug commercialized in china since 2016 had been recommended to treat the sars-cov-2-infected patients by the chinese government we found that the pharmacokinetic parameters of cvl218 and arbidol were comparable with similar plasma concentrations and drug exposures table s3  arbidol was mostly distributed in stomach and plasma post administration in rats in contrast higher distributions of cvl218 in tissues especially in lung rather than plasma compared to those of arbidol indicated a superior pharmacokinetic profile of cvl218 which may render it as a better potential antiviral treatment of sars-cov-2 infection in lung in rats after being orally administrated 2060160 mgkg of cvl218 for 28 consecutive days and followed by 28 more days without drug administration methods we observed no significant difference in body weight of rats among different dosage and the control groups  figure 4a  we next conducted a toxicokinetic analysis of cvl218 in rats methods in particular rats were given cvl218 2060160 mgkg by oral gavage once a day for consecutive 28 days followed by 28 days without cvl218 administration to investigate the reversibility of the toxic effects of the compound and examine whether there is any potential delayed-onset toxicity of this drug in rats the results showed that the maximum tolerable dose mtd and the no-observed adverse effect level noael were 160 mgkg and 20 mgkg respectively the exposure of female rats to cvl218 auc 024  was 7605 hngml in day 1 and 6657 hngml in day 28 while that of male rats auc 024  was 9102 hngml in day 1 and 10253 hngml in day 28 table s4  based on the toxicokinetic results from the repeated dose studies all rats survived after a 28-day treatment period and showed no apparent signs of toxicity monkeys were administered cvl218 5 20 or 80 mgkg by nasogastric feeding tubes with a consecutive daily dosing schedule for 28 days followed by a 28-day recovery period methods only a slight decrease of body weight was observed in the highdose 80 mgkg group and all changes were reversed after a 28-day recovery period overall the above in vivo data showed that cvl218 possesses good pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic characteristics in rats and monkeys and its high-level distribution in the therapeutically targeted tissue ie lung may greatly favor the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection as the previous studies have reported that the parp1 inhibitor pj-34 can target the n-terminal domain ntd of the coronavirus nucleocapsid n protein to reduce its rna binding and thus impede viral replication 31 32 33  we speculated that olaparib and cvl218 may also interact with the n protein of sars-cov-2 to perform the similar antiviral function to test this hypothesis we conducted molecular docking to study the potential interactions between these two drugs and the n-ntd of sars-cov-2 methods the overall structure of hcov-oc43 another coronavirus phylogenetically closely related to sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-2 share similar compositions of secondary structure elements including five conserved  strands and flexible loops  figure 5a  in addition their sequences covering the corresponding binding pocket regions are well conserved  figure 5c  thus their structures may provide common molecular features in terms of interactions with small molecules at this binding pocket therefore we also used the experimentally solved structure of hcov-oc43-n-ntd complexed with pj-34 as a reference to analyze our docking results our docking results more details can also be found in supplementary  in this study we reported a top down data integration approach by combining both machine learning and statistical analysis techniques followed by web-lab experimental validation to identify potential drug candidates for treating sars-cov-2 infection we showed that the parp1 inhibitor cvl218 discovered by our in silico drug repurposing framework may have the therapeutic potential for the treatment of covid-19 although we mainly conducted in vitro assays to experimentally validate the anti-sars-cov-2 effects of olaparib and cvl218 due to limited time it is natural to speculate that other parp1 inhibitors may also have antiviral activities against sars-cov-2 infection based on our computational prediction and experimental validation results based on the data present in this study and the previously known evidences reported in the literature we propose several potential mechanisms to help understand the involvement of parp1 inhibitors in the treatment of covid-19  figure 6  first during the life cycle of the coronavirus parp1 inhibitors may inhibit the viral growth through suppressing viral replication and impeding the binding of the nucleocapsid protein to viral rnas 31 34 35 36  which can also be supported by our molecular docking results see section 26 second parp1 inhibitors have been previously reported to play a critical role in regulating inflammatory response by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as nf-b ap-1 il-6 and downstream cytokines and chemokines 37 38 39 40  also it has been shown that the overactivation of parp1 promotes energy nad  atp consumption and drives cell death exacerbating the inflammation response 37 38 39 41  parp1 inhibitors thus may repress the nf-b-mediated pro-inflammatory signals and reduce energy failure and subsequent cell death induced by necrosis thus providing a clinical potential for attenuating the cytokine storm and inflammatory response caused by sars-cov-2 infection third adp-ribosylation is a conserved post-translational modification on the nucleocapsid proteins across different coronavirus lineages implying that it may have an important regulatory role for the structure packing of viral genome several previous studies have demonstrated that parp1 is critical for viral replication 35 42 43  for example parp1 has been reported to interact with hemagglutinin ha of influenza a virus iav and promote its replication by triggering the degradation of host type i ifn receptor 44  in addition the adp-ribosylation of adenoviral core proteins displays an antiviral defense mechanism 34  therefore intervening the adp-ribosylation mediated interplay between parp1 and viral proteins may be another important pathway for parp1 inhibitors to prevent sars-cov-2 infection of course to throughly understand the anti-sars-cov-2 roles of parp1 inhibitors more experimental studies and direct clinical evidences will be needed in the future considering the pro-inflammatory role of parp1 the therapeutic effects of parp1 inhibitors in inflammatory-mediated diseases have been extensively studied over past two decades 45 46  pj-34 the early generation parp1 inhibitor has been suggested in previous studies to have neuroprotective effects in stroke model and protect mice from necroptosis-associated liver injuries by repressing the il-33 expression 47 48  in addition the fda-approved parp1 inhibitor olaparib has been reported to protect against the lps lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung and kidney injuries in a nf-b-dependent manner in mice 49  numerous pre-clinical studies demonstrated that parp1 inhibitors play an essential role in a range of inflammatory injuries and related diseases especially the lung inflammatory disorders including ards acute respiratory distress syndrome copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma 40 46 50 51  all these studies suggest that parp1 inhibitors are of high relevance to the treatment of the novel pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 infection possibly via their roles in modulating inflammatory response notably current pathological studies have shown that the severe patients infected by sars-cov-2 generally have higher plasma levels of il-2 il-6 il-10 tnf ifn- 25 27 28 29  implying a high risk of the inflammatory-associated cytokine storm after viral infection in addition reduction and functional exhaustion of t cells have also been observed in covid-19 patients 27  therefore blocking the overactive inflammatory response may be an effective strategy for the treatment of covid-19 particularly for those icu patients infected by sars-cov-2 recently tocilizumab a monoclonal anti-body drug targeting il-6 has been recommended for the treatment of covid-19 in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 promulgated by the chinese government httpwwwnhcgovcnyzygjs7653p20 e964pdf which also highlights the vital role of anti-inflammatory response in current therapeutics against sars-cov-2 our in vitro study has showed that cvl218 can effectively inhibit the il-6 production induced by cpg in pbmcs figure 3  this finding indicates that cvl218 may also possess the il-6 specific anti-inflammatory effect that is applicable to those severe patients infected by sars-cov-2 parp1 inhibitors are originally used for targeting homologous recombination repair defects in cancers and mainly categorized as oncology drugs thus it would generally need more safety data to justify any repurposing of parp1 inhibitors for non-oncology indications fortunately there are numerous existing pre-clinical and clinical studies on repurposing parp1 inhibitors into non-oncological diseases including the aforementioned acute diseases eg acute respiratory distress syndrome ards stroke 52 and chronic diseases eg rheumatoid arthritis and vascular diseases 52 53  all these evidences indicate the possibility of repurposing parp1 inhibitors as a safe therapeutic agent to treat the current acute lung disease caused by sars-cov-2 infection in addition our pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic data in rats and monkeys shown in our study indicate that cvl218 may have a relatively acceptable safety profile to be repositioned for the antiviral purpose moreover cvl218 has been approved to enter phase i clinical trial in 2017 by national medical products administration nmpa in china for cancer treatment the preliminary data from the phase i clinical trial have shown that cvl218 is well tolerated in ascending dose studies at doses as high as 1000 mg qd and 500 mg bid and no grade ii and above adverse events have been observed which indicates that cvl218 is also quite safe and well tolerated in human our pharmacokinetic examination in rats has shown that cvl218 has the highest level distribution in the lung tissue 188-fold higher concentration compared to that in plasma such a tissue specific enrichment in lung may bring an extra advantage for cvl218 to be used for the anti-sars-cov-2 purpose as lung is the therapeutically targeted tissue for covid-19 moreover high level distribution in lung may also suggest that only low dosage is needed in order to ensure the therapeutic efficacy of cvl218 against sars-cov-2 which may further reduce the risk of adverse events thus cvl218 may have great potential to be repurposed as an effective therapeutic agent to combat sars-cov-2 and prevent future epidemic outbreak the virus-related knowledge graph was constructed for predicting the coronavirus related drugs in total seven networks were considered in the constructed knowledge graph figure 1b  including a human target-drug interaction network a virus target-drug interaction network a human protein-protein

fingerprints with a radius of 2 computed using the rdkit tool 65  the protein sequence similarity networks of both human and virus were obtained by calculating the smith-waterman similarities of the amino acid sequences derived from uniprot 66 using a sequence alignment software provided in 67  noted that we collected additional protein sequences of sars-cov-2 from uniprot 66 and added them into the corresponding networks for the final prediction those drugs without drug-target interactions or outside the drug-bank database were removed from the corresponding networks we then constructed the virus-related knowledge graph by merging together all the nodes and edges of the above seven networks  figure 1b  the constructed knowledge graph g  v e is an undirected graph in which each node v  v in the node set v belongs to one of the node types including drugs human proteins and virus proteins and each edge e  e in the edge set e  v  v  r belongs to one of the relation types from the relation type set r including two drug-target interactions two protein-protein interactions and three similarities the initial list of drug candidates targeting sars-cov-2 was first screened using a network-based knowledge mining algorithm modified from our previous work 68 69  the goal was to capture the hidden virus-related feature information and accurately predict the potential drug candidates from the constructed knowledge graph which was realized through learning a network topology-preserving embedding for each node more specifically our model used a graph convolution algorithm 70 to gather and update feature information for each node in the constructed heterogeneous knowledge graph network from neighborhoods so that the network topology information can be fully exploited suppose that we perform t iterations of graph convolution at iteration 1  t  t  the message m t v passed to node v can be expressed as where a vur stands for the weight for edge e  u v r a uvr  avur u avur  w t r  r dd and b t r  r d stand for the learnable parameters relu x  max0 x and n r v  u u  v u  v u v r  e denotes the set of adjacent nodes connected to v  v through edges of type r  r then the feature h t v of node v is updated by where w t  r dd and b t  r d stand for the learnable parameters and concat  stands for the concatenation operation finally the confidence score s uv of the relation r between node u and node v is derived from the learned node embeddings and the corresponding projection matrices that is where g r  h r  r dk stand for the edge-type specific projection matrices we minimized the bayesian personalized ranking bpr loss 71 for drug-target interaction reconstruction by regarding those edges not in the edge set e as missing values rather than negative samples that is where s uv and s wx stand for the confidence scores of the relation r between u and v and between w and x respectively and  stands for the sigmoid activation function intuitively in the above loss function the confidence scores of the node pairs u v in the edge set ie u v r  e were encouraged to be higher than those of unseen pairs w x ie w x r   e we predicted the confidence scores under the relation of virus target-drug interactions for each virus target-drug pair using equation 3 then the confidence scores were averaged across all the proteins of a certain virus eg sars-cov mers-cov or sars-cov-2 and the corresponding p-values were obtained by z-test for each virus we selected those predictions with a p-value  005 as drug candidates we used a deep learning based relation extraction method named bere 4 to extract the coronavirus related drugs from large-scale literature texts more specifically the sentences mentioning the two entities of interest ie name or alias of a coronavirus or coronavirus target or name or alias of a drug were first collected using a dictionarybased name entity recognition method string matching for each pair of entities e 1  e 2  there are usually more than one sentence describing the underlying relations therefore we used a bag of sentences s e 1 e 2  denoting the set of all the sentences mentioning both e 1 and e 2  to predict the relation between these two entities we first encoded each sentence s  s e 1 e 2 in a semantic and syntactic manner using a hybrid deep neural network h  s  r d  including a self-attention module 72  a bidirectional gated recurrent unit gru module 73 and a gumbel tree-gru module 4 74  each sentence representation hs was then scored by a sentence-level attention module to indicate its contribution to the relation prediction that is where s  r stands for the weight score and w s  r d1 stands for the learnable weight parameters finally the relation was predicted by a binary classifier based on the weighted sum of sentence representations that is r e 1 e 2  classifier where r e 1 e 2 stands for the probability of the relation of interest between entities e 1 and e 2 mentioned by the bag of sentences s e 1 e 2  the training corpus we used was curated automatically from nearly 20 million pubmed httpwwwpubmedgov abstracts by a distant supervision technique 75  in detail the names or aliases of drugs or targets in sentences were first annotated by a dictionary-based named entity recognition method string matching in which the name dictionary was derived from drugbank version 510 17  with ambiguous names eg common words removed next the label for each bag of sentences co-mentioning a drug-target pair of interest was annotated automatically by the known drug-target interactions in drugbank the unlabeled corpus that we used in this work for text-mining the coronavirus related drugs was obtained from approximately 22 million pmc full-text articles with entities of interest annotated using the aforementioned named entity recognition approach a coronavirus related drug was extracted as a hit candidate if the model found a bag of sentences describing a relation between this drug and a target in the coronavirus of interest we used the transcriptome analysis approach to further filter the potential drug candidates for treating the covid-19 patients infected by sars-cov-2 due to the lack of gene expression data from the sars-cov-2 infected patients we used those from the sars-cov infected patients to screen the potential therapeutic drug candidates against covid-19 such a strategy is reasonable as sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are two closely related and highly similar coronavirus first the genome of sars-cov-2 is phylogenetically close to that of sars-cov with about 79 of sequence identity 76  and the m membrane n nucleocapsid and e envelope proteins of these two coronaviruses have over 90 sequence similarities 77  in addition the pathogenic mechanisms of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were highly similar 78  in particularly we collected the gene expression profiles of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from ten sars-cov infected patients geogse1739 6  the raw gene expression values were first converted into logarithm scale and then the differential expression values z-scores were computed by comparing to those of

santosh kumar kaining zhi ahona mukherji kelli gerth   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a current emerging infectious disease it has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization who covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 dr zhengli shi the most famous scientist in the field of sars has proposed that the origin of sars-cov-2 could be from bats in yunan province which is 2000 km away from wuhan in hubei province 2 based on the history of sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and swine acute diarrhea syndrome sads two of which originated from china through bats researchers in china in early 2019 speculated that sars- or mers-like coronaviruses are likely to originate from bats in china 34 although the immediate origin and transfer to humans is debatable rapid human-to-human transfer has been widely confirmed covid-19 causes symptomatic severe acute respiratory disease in approximately 15 of infected individuals and fatality in approximately 4 though these rates vary from country to country 1 the previous two zoonotic coronaviruses that caused a worldwide pandemic are mers and sads which appeared in 2012 and 2017 respectively 5 compared to these coronaviruses and other related viruses like ebola 2003 and h1n1 2009 sars-cov-2 has emerged as the most resilient with a perfect combination of ease of transmission late incubation period symptomatic nature and morbidity and mortality 6 statistically a very small percentage of viruses even among coronaviruses will have the right combination of infection rate incubation period and morbidity and mortality 7 sars-cov-2 is transmitted human-to-human through air droplets that result from sneezing coughing or even breathing and speaking this has led to the transmission of this virus among large populations worldwide within a few months its long incubation time 510 days makes it difficult to detect early symptoms thus asymptomatic persons can inadvertently spread the virus to others the covid-19 mortality rate appears to be lower than with other recent viral outbreaks however it is essential to note that its mortality rate is difficult to measure accurately as the data is still being collected importantly it attacks vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised and elderly individuals as well as those with underlying conditions such as heart and lung conditions diabetes and kidney disease 1 covid-19 is especially deadly among these populations 8 in many countries anti-hiv drugs lopinavirritonavir and saquinavir antimalaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and other drugs have been tested in clinics some of these drugs have shown potential in reducing the symptoms or treating covid-19 91011 novel drugs and vaccines are also being developed by many institutions as well as by biotech and pharmaceutical companies across the world 1213 however it is likely to be at least one year before drugs andor vaccines become available for administration to covid-19 patients therefore until we find drugs andor vaccines for covid-19 repurposing existing drugs is likely to play a significant role in reducing symptoms or treating the disease in patients it is however important to note that social distancing and taking extra precautions are the principle ways one can mitigate the worldwide spread and morbidity and mortality caused by sars-cov-2 infection 14 in this review we will first briefly describe the structural and genetic features of sars-cov-2 current and predicted epidemiology of covid-19 worldwide current treatment options potential targets in the sars-cov-2 life cycle for drug development andor repurposing of existing drugs manufacturing feasibility and regulatory affairs the main theme of this review however is the repurposing of protease inhibitor pi drugs which are currently used to treat human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis c virus hcv and other rna viruses in the treatment of covid-19 although severe cases of covid-19 remain the most contagious both asymptomatic and recovered patients impede efforts to control the spread of the virus unique among infectious diseases patients who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection continue to exhibit positive real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr tests 15 thus the center of disease control cdc guidelines suggest social distancing of at least 6 ft as the primary means of controlling viral spread 16 a significant loss of human life has already occurred around the world and new modeling predicts that further substantial loss is on the horizon since the initial outbreak in wuhan in december of 2019 over 83000 cases of covid-19 were confirmed across mainland china as of 15 april 2020 15 the world health organization who declared covid-19 a pandemic on 11 march 2020 17 while china has seen rates of infection peak and subside dramatically confirmed cases are now experiencing exponential growth in europe and the united states with an increasing number of cases now observed on the indian subcontinent and in south america 18 as of 15 april 2020 the johns hopkins center for systems science and engineering csse has tracked over 2 million cases worldwide including 345000 cases in the united states alone additionally over 133000 deaths and over 350000 recoveries have been observed worldwide the united states now leads the world in the total number of confirmed cases 19 assuming that full social distancing is enforced in the united states through the end of may 2020 modeling from the university of washingtons institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme predicts that daily deaths will peak on 16 april 2020 at 2644 deaths per day the curve will decay through may and june and will not flatten until july by 4 august ihme projects a total of 93531 deaths from covid-19 in the united states alone 20 it is important to note that the total number of confirmed cases worldwide may not reflect the actual number due in part to limitations in testing and undetected cases 2122 therefore a high likelihood that large numbers of cases remain undetected only increases the urgency of facilitating widespread testing and finding sustainable treatment strategies for covid-19 similar to other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 is a spherical particle approximately 50 nm in diameter it contains a membrane envelope protein nucleocapsid and most importantly spike protein projecting from its surface as well as single-stranded rna ssrna 23 the sars-cov-2 spike protein binds to a receptor on the human cell surface called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is most abundant in the type ii alveolar cells of the lungs 2425 latching of the spike protein onto human cells causes them to undergo a structural change that allows the viral membrane to fuse with the host cell membrane viral genes then enter into the host cells and translate into polypeptides which further mature into the individual proteins required to form the viral core and surface protein spike the virus then matures produces multiple copies and escapes from the host cells to infect new cells the genome of sars-cov-2 is 796 identical to other coronaviruses genomes with as much as 95 identity at a certain part of the genome of other coronaviruses and with bat coronaviruses 2 sars-cov-2 encodes four structural genes spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid the largest gene in sars-cov-2 is orflab open reading frames 1a and 1b encoding the pplab peptide pheromone encoding lipoprotein a and b and 15 nsps viral nonstructural proteins this also encodes for the ppla protein peptide pheromone encoding lipoprotein a which contains 10 nsps the absence of 8a protein and fluctuation in the number of amino acids in the 8b and 3c proteins in sars-cov-2 differentiates it from other coronaviruses the major factor which makes sars-cov-2 more infective than other coronaviruses is its spike protein which is highly specific to binding human ace2 enzyme 26 a single n56it mutation significantly enhances the binding affinity of spike protein of sars-cov-2with ace2 based on the known life cycle of sars-cov-2 the who has proposed several targets for drug development as well as the repurposing of existing drugs 27 the first target is attacking the virus with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma plasma obtained from recovered patients the second target is inhibition of ace2 by using novel or existing drugs which may have cross-reactivity with other aces the third target could be the inhibition of viral endocytosis by using antimalaria drugs eg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine the fourth potential and important target could be inhibition of proteolysis of polypeptides using general or specific proteases many anti-hiv anti-hcv and other antiviral and antiretroviral drugs have been developed to target proteases 2829 finally the fifth target could be the inhibition of rna polymerization using rna polymerase developed for other rna viruses this could inhibit the formation of multiple copies of rna and ultimately viral replication in this technique plasma or purified monoclonal antibodies produced against covid-19 are obtained from recovered patients and given to new patients as treatment in a recent study convalescent plasma treatments were administered to five critically ill covid-19 patients in shenzhen china from 20 january to 25 march 2020 34 in this study patients received convalescent plasma with a sars-cov-2-specific antibody between 10 and 22 days after admission among the five patients four of them showed a decreased score in sequential organ failure assessments and viral loads their viral test also became negative within 12 days after the transfusion these four patients were also removed from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment finally three patients were discharged from the hospital in approximately 50 days although this trial has a very small sample size the results of convalescent plasma treatment are still encouraging this method has been proposed as a treatment option in the us 35 tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized antihuman il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody it was originally developed to treat rheumatoid arthritis based on its specific binding to sil-6r and mil-6r and inhibition of signal transduction 36 more importantly humans have a very high tolerance for tocilizumab there were no reported significant abnormalities in clinicopathological studies or histopathological evaluations scientists and physicians in china suspect that il-6 may play a role in the treatment of covid-19 their findings concluded that tocilizumab is an effective treatment in patients with severe cases of covid-19 thalidomide is an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent it was designed to boost t cells treat inflammation inhibit cell proliferation and reduce lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis 32 in covid-19 its main role is to protect the lungs from damage caused by immunological reactions however thalidomide needs to be used with other antiviral agents since it does not eliminate or suppress viral load a case report from wenzhou medical university has proved that thalidomide has adjuvant effects in covid-19 treatment remdesivir was originally developed to combat ebola and related viruses it works by inhibiting rna-dependent rna polymerase 37 since the target is similar both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the drug can inhibit the coronaviruses that cause sars and mers 38 the first covid-19 patient from washington us was given remdesivir when his condition worsened and the case report suggests that his condition improved 39 another late-stage patient from california also survived upon receiving remdesivir case reports alone cannot prove that remdesivir is safe and effective and therefore clinical trials are underway since it is well-tolerated at relatively high doses it is possible that remdesivir is likely to work if given at a high dose and early during the infection without causing significant toxicity the antimalaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown efficacy against covid-19 in patients and in in vitro experiments currently several countries are recruiting patients to test the safety and efficacy of chloroquine including brazil spain norway china and italy the first clinical trial for hydroxychloroquine has been completed in shanghai 40 the drugs generally work by decreasing the acidity in endosomes which ingest outside materials including viruses 41 although the entry mechanism of sars-cov-2 is through the spike-ace2 interaction in vitro studies using cell culture have suggested that chloroquines have inhibition activity against sars-cov-2 at relatively high doses with a potential risk of side effects 42 chloroquines also work by inhibiting cytokine storm which occurs as a result of massive viral replication 43 the usefulness of chloroquines especially hydroxychloroquine may be explained retrospectively by the fact that there is a reduced spreading of sars-cov-2 in malaria-rich regions where hydroxychloroquine has been used on a routine basis hydroxychloroquine may work as prophylaxis for covid-19 depending on the clinical trial results from shanghai 40 opinion among scientists and health care professionals increasingly supports the use of hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic agent as a result the fda and cdc have allowed hydroxyquinoline as potential therapy for covid-19 in the clinics upon physicians prescription with extra precautions earlier literature suggests that protease inhibitors pis including the alcohol-dependence drug disulfiram and antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir have been reported to be active against sars and mers 44 although clinical studies are lacking disulfiram has been reported to inhibit the papain-like protease of mers and sars in cell culture 45 with regard to the hiv pis lopinavir and ritonavir clinical trials in patients infected with 2019-ncov have been initiated in multiple countries 46 lopinavir and ritonavir have initially shown improved clinical outcomes in patients with sars in a nonrandomized trial however it is yet to be determined whether hiv pis could effectively inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like and papain-like proteases of 2019-ncov 47 while hiv protease belongs to the aspartic protease family sars-cov-2 proteases are from the cysteine protease family in a separate study martinez showed that lpvrtv and interferon beta lpvrtv-infb in combination are effective in patients infected with sars-cov 48 the drugs also showed improved clinical parameters in mice infected with mers-cov in some countries including china and india anti-hiv drugs lpvrtv have been used against covid-19 4749 although these drugs showed encouraging results from in vitro studies data from wuhan china using a very small sample size did not show a significant difference 47 the recipients of these drugs and those receiving standard care did not differ significantly in time to clinical improvement median 16 days duration of intensive care unit stay days of mechanical ventilation or days of oxygen support a similar study by bhatnagar et al using lpvrtv for treating covid-19 patients in india is underway 49 if the treatment outcomes amongst initial cases are found to be useful in managing initial covid-19 patients a randomized controlled trial would be performed to guide future therapeutic use of this combination another study from korea by kim et al on the use of lpvrtv in covid-19 patients suggests that the decrease in viral titer may be a result of an antiviral effect the natural cause of viral suppression or both 5051 however the authors are optimistic that lpvrtv administration reduces viral load a limitation of the study is that the patients were given lpvrtv on day 10 when patients have been shown to naturally improve their symptoms including fever the effect of lpvrtv is yet to be seen if the drugs are given early as soon as individuals are infected by sars-cov-2 regardless of the case report the authors believe that lpvrtv are promising anti-hiv drugs for the treatment of covid-19 however prior to its recommendation well-designed studies need to be carried out to gain more evidence although these results are not promising using an in silico protein-drug modeling approach ortega et al determined that the main sars-cov-2 protease is a target for hiv pis 5253 their results showed a strong interaction between hiv pis eg lpv and rtv and the active site of the sars-cov-2 protease they further tested a library of 20 pis which revealed potential interactions between the sars-cov-2 protease and these pis the results suggest development of a series of derivatives with optimized activity against sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses anti-hiv drugs from the pi class could be more effective if targeted at the sars-cov-2-infected cells andor at higher doses however a higher dose of pis if effective for covid-19 would also cause toxicity and severe side effects as most pis are known to be toxic at higher doses 54 in addition being a substrate as well as an inhibitor of a major drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome p450 3a4 cyp3a4 these drugs cause drugdrug interactions ddi with approximately half of all marketed drugs 5556 since covid-19 has elevated symptoms and complications in elderly patients and in patients with underlying diseases such as heart problems diabetes and respiratory complications pis could cause major ddi and ultimately drug toxicity similarly these drugs are substrates and inhibitors of a major drug efflux transporter p-glycoprotein pgp and also have the potential to cause ddi via the pgp pathway 57 therefore there is a need to bypass cyp3a4- and pgp-mediated ddi and reduce toxicity to have an effective covid-19 treatment especially at high doses further a unique drug delivery system which has the ability to target the infected cells would also provide increased drug concentrations at the target cells and reduced off-target effects figure 1 to bypass drug efflux transporters and metabolic enzymes and target the disease site a nano particle-based drug delivery system is highly desirable 57 however the use of chemical-based nanoparticles can be toxic difficult to eliminate from the body and may require fda approval on the other hand extracellular vesicles evs are membrane-derived nanovesicles that are circulated in extracellular body fluids such as plasma and urine 58 therefore for long-term safety and the ability to carry biological and therapeutic molecules to the target site it is highly desirable to develop evs as biological nanoparticles which are capable of delivering therapeutic agents to infected tissues 59 the literature supports the development of an ev-based drug delivery platform for the potential use of therapeutic interventions in suppressing hiv reservoirs in the brain and reducing hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders hand 60 the literature also supports the application of an ev-based drug delivery system for the treatment of many cancers and cns diseasesdisorders 61 extracellular vesicles evs produced from most cellstissuesorgans are natural carriers for biological molecules including dna rna mirna proteins lipids and other small molecules 62 evs are involved in many biological processes via intercellular communications especially in the case of disease conditions such as cancer infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders 63 being natural carriers of biomolecules evs may also be used as unique drug-delivery systems for drugs in a variety of diseases conditions 64 evs have already been used to encapsulate small molecules nucleic acids peptides and proteins to treat different diseases the majority of which are cancers 65 among anticancer agents curcumin doxorubicin and paclitaxel are the top three drugs being investigated for example kim et al developed an ev-encapsulated paclitaxel to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer cells 66 the ev encapsulation improved cytotoxicity more than 50-fold in drug-resistant cancer cells compared with paclitaxel treatment alone more importantly an almost complete localization of ev-encapsulated paclitaxel was detected in a mouse model evs that can be used in drug delivery are mainly derived from the endolysosomal pathway also called exosomes 67 the common features of endolysosomal-derived vesiclesexosomes are that their size varies between 30 nm to 200 nm and they contain endosomal-associated proteins including tetraspanins cd9 cd63 and cd81 68 ev-based drug delivery provides an opportunity for utilization in personalized medicine in which evs can be isolated from the plasma of a patient loaded with the drugs of interest and administered back to the same patient 69 figure 1 this method is referred to as exogenous drug loading and it can also be done in evs isolated from the media of cellscell lines 70 this requires the isolation and characterizations of evs of a particular size 200 nm from plasma or media and it has the ability to interact with and deliver drugs to recipient cells 71 many drugs especially nucleotides mrna mirna sirna and dsdna have been loaded using exogenous techniques 72 this technique utilizes direct incubation sonication electroporation freeze-thaw and extrusion methods 73 a particular loading method is selected and optimized based on each drug of interest in terms of its size shape and needs for treatment outcomes to prepare a larger quantity of ev-loaded drugs for the general population and to target affected cells one can load drugs in evs using the endogenous drug-loading method endogenous loading is a method that uses cells to excrete evs with target drugs encapsulated in them 74 in endogenous loading evs already have target drugs loaded once purified from cell culture media this is done by incubating drugs with cellscell lines that the disease targets using the in vitro method this method has the ability to scale up the technology for preparing a large quantity of drug-loaded evs 64 these drug-loaded evs have the ability to target the diseased tissue which is likely to have increased efficacy and reduced off-target effects compared with free drugs 75 the endogenous drug-loading method has been used to load small molecules especially anticancer agents 76 this method has also been used to load nucleotides for various diseases 777879 there are at least eight pis that have been developed and used alone or in combination with ritonavir for the treatment of hiv 80 some of these pi regimens are still being used as the first line of therapy in some parts of the world 8182 in some cases these pis especially lpvrtv and drvrtv are used as the second line of therapy 83 thus the development of an ev-based drug delivery platform for hiv pis individually and in combination with the pharmaco-enhancer rtv is highly desirable it is also possible that single protease inhibitor-loaded evs are as effective as evs loaded along with rtv rtv strongly inhibits cyp3a4 and increases pi plasma concentrations in principle this would be unnecessary when the drugs are loaded in evs as evs are likely to bypass cyp3a4 if successful this drug delivery technology can be expanded to other existing antiviral and antiretroviral pis or antibacterial drugs which have shown some efficacy for treating covid-19 in the case of covid-19 anti-hiv pis other pis or other antiviral and antibacterial drugs can be encapsulated in vero ccl-81 vero e6 andor stat1 knockout cell lines using the endogenous loading technique these model cell lines have been developed by atcc and can be infected with sars-cov-2 84 drugs loaded in evs and isolated from these cells would have the ability to target these same cells pis can also be loaded in evs isolated from the plasma of patients using the exogenous loading method for personalized therapy the ev-encapsulated drugs can be first tested for efficacy in vero ccl-81 vero e6 andor stat1 knockout cell lines followed by pharmacokinetics tissue distribution and finally efficacy in an animal model the lead formulations can then be used for human clinical trials at multiple sites the clinical trials for repurposing pis and other drugs using evs could be very rapid because the drugs are already fda-approved and evs are natural nanovesicles the literature suggests that evs derived from a particular cell type eg immune cells can seek diseased andor inflammatory immune cells by targeting the cell surface proteins 85 therefore it is likely that evs derived from sars-cov-2 model cell lines eg vero ccl-81 or vero e6 have surface proteins that can recognize sars-cov-2-infected alveolar macrophages and may secrete ev-encapsulated drugs in these cells however it is also possible that ev isolation and drug encapsulation techniques may result in the loss of the functional properties of the evs perhaps by destroying surface proteins thus it is difficult to rule out nonspecific interactions of evs with other cells leading to off-target effects if the off-target effects cause toxicity and suboptimal efficacy evs may need to be engineered to target sars-cov-2-infected cells this can be done by engineering evs isolated from plasma vero ccl-81 or vero e6 cells with surface proteins or antibodies that can bind specific proteins on the target cells in addition new techniques may be developed to encapsulate these evs in another biomimetic nanostructure eg liposomes for the delivery of ev-encapsulated drugs 86 evs have been shown to deliver their biological cargos via multiple mechanisms such as the fusion of evs with recipient cells and engulfing of evs by a variety of recipient cells 87 although the mechanism of drug delivery to recipient cells by evs has not been fully studied it is likely that a similar mechanism to deliver drug-encapsulated evs may also exist in most cases ev-based drug products need to be administered in the form of injections hence the sterility of the drug product is critical evs were recently shown to maintain stability under autoclave temperatures 88 more importantly ev-based drug products were reported to be eligible for sterile filtration using filters with 200 nm pore sizes 87 both autoclave and sterile filtration are fda-approved methods for sterile drug preparation hence ev-based pis will be eligible for sterile drug manufacturing in the case of covid-19 the fda already granted orphan drug approval for remdesivir even though gilead rescinded additionally the fda is granting facilitated regulatory pathways for most clinical trial applications given their background ev-based pis might bypass the preclinical stage and move to phase ii directly because evs are natural carriers with very solid safety data phase i studies might be waived by the fda the facilitated regulatory pathway is a strategy used by most regulatory agencies around the world to resolve pandemic diseases including covid-19 sars ebola etc 8990 such strategies will save time resources and in the best scenario peoples lives ev-based drug products can be prepared through similar methods as lipid nanoparticles using exogenous loading methods a typical life cycle of a potential ev-based drug product under cgmp standards should include production of ev raw materials ev characterization drug loading under cgmp conditions in-process testing fill-finish final-release testing and stability testing similar to lipid nanoparticle-based drug products major quality control focuses on raw ev size distribution postprocessing encapsulated drug amount free drug amount size distribution zeta potential and product stability the scalability of production is not a problem for current technologies the bottleneck of ev-based drug production is drug loading into evs current high-pressure homogenizers can process 100 l of drug liquid 9192 furthermore the ultracentrifugation technique can be used to process the elimination of 10 l of free drugs 93 the university of tennessee health science center has an fda-registered gmp facility named the plough center with one coauthor working in it this facility provides a top tier cleanroom environment and sterile injectable equipment ensuring that ev-based drug production could be rapid feasible and may move forward to clinical stages 94 although evs have the ability to circulate via plasma and deliver their components to distant tissuesorgans some general limitations are important to be addressed before realizing their clinical potential these are 1 interaction of drugs with ev components 2 a robust understanding of how administered evs are transported in vivo 3 in vivo pharmacokinetics of ev-drugs 4 delivery of drugs to the target and 5 immune clearance 9596 importantly evs have similar structures as liposomes with two layers of lipids a hydrophilic surface and core layer with a hydrophobic membrane layer antiretroviral pis are not water soluble and therefore these drugs will mainly reside inside the membrane due to the partition coefficient however unlike liposomes we do not have a comprehensive understanding of how changes in size 30150 nm charge zeta potential 5 to 20 and the presence of specific surface proteins based on the origin of evs affect their systemic circulation overcoming of barriers eg bbb delivery of cargo to targeted tissuesorgans and clearance although evs are expected to have poor entrapment in the plasma and clearance by the phagocytic system which may lead to enhanced distribution and increased half-life their biochemical complexity needs to be considered 7597 furthermore although strong preclinical evidence for systemic circulation and tissueorgan targeting exists for evs eg brain 9899 it is important to fully understand their transport and delivery mechanisms however in the case of covid-19 we may not have sufficient time to perform comprehensive preclinical studies to understand the delivery of antiretroviral pis to target tissues therefore it is important that the fda expedites the approval of an ev-based delivery method for pis to treat covid-19 upon determining its relative safety and efficacy compared with free drugs in a small clinical trial covid-19 is a global risk to humanity and its impacts on health are yet to be determined since the development of new drugs and vaccines will take at least a year it is critical that we consistently work on its mitigation until the world recovers from its spread while the disease is spreading exponentially especially in the us several drugs are being tested to either reduce the symptoms of the disease or treat patients plasma treatment by isolating antibodies from recovered patients and administering it to new patients in a controlled manner is likely to be promising several drugs that were initially developed for other diseases have also been tried with patients as well as tested in cell culture experiments among which several antibody-based immunosuppressive drugs the anti-cov drug remdesivir the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine and the anti-hiv drugs lopinavirritonavir have shown promising results these drugs are therefore the subjects of further investigation in clinical trials for the treatment of covid-19 there is also an initiative to repurpose anti-hiv pis using unique drug delivery systems that utilize natural nanocarriers evs these ev-encapsulated drugs have the ability to bypass liver metabolism and target diseased tissues enhancing their efficacy and reducing off-target effects or drug toxicity  predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 through a drug-target interaction deep learning model bo beck ram bonggun shin yoonjung choi sungsoo park keunsoo kang   coronaviruses covs belonging to the family coronaviridae are positive-sense enveloped rna viruses and cause infections in birds mammals and humans 1 2 3 the family includes four genera such as alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus deltacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus
4 two infamous infectious coronaviruses in the genus betacoronavirus are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 5 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 6 which have infected more than 10000 people around the world in the past two decades unfortunately the incidence was accompanied by high mortality rates 96 for sars-cov and 344 for mers-cov indicating that there is an urgent need for effective treatment at the beginning of the outbreak to prevent the spread 7 8 however this cannot be achieved with current drug development or an application system taking several years for newly developed drugs to come to the market unexpectedly the world is facing the same situation as the previous outbreak due to a recent epidemic of atypical pneumonia designated as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in wuhan china 5 9 sars-cov-2 which belongs to betacoronavirus contains a positive-sense single-stranded rna ssrna genome 29903 bp and contains genes encoding 3c-like proteinase rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 2-o-ribose methyltransferase spike protein envelope protein nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and several unknown proteins according to the genome sequencing data of sars-cov-2 httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenbanksars-cov-2-seqs typical clinical symptoms of covid-19 are fever dry cough and fatigue within 37 days of latency on average after infection this is relatively slower than severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which was caused by sars-cov 10 during the life cycle of coronaviruses the virus replicates via the following processes after entering the host cell 1 translation of genomic rna grna 2 proteolysis of the translated polyprotein with viral 3c-like proteinase 3 replication of grna with the viral replication complex that consists of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase 3-to-5 exonuclease endornase and 2-o-ribose methyltransferase and 4 assembly of viral components 11 these replication-associated proteins are the primary targets of post-entry treatment drugs to suppress viral replication although much intensive effort is being made worldwide to develop drugs or vaccines for sars-cov-2 patients currently suffering from covid-19 cannot expect benefits from them due to the slow development process of novel drugs or vaccines thus a rapid drug application strategy that can be immediately applied to the patient is necessary currently the only way to address this matter is to repurpose commercially available drugs for the pathogen in so-called drug-repurposing however in theory artificial intelligence ai-based architectures must be taken into account in order to accurately predict drug-target interactions dtis this is because of the enormous amount of complex information eg hydrophobic interactions ionic interactions hydrogen bonding andor van der waals forces between molecules to this end we previously developed a deep learning-based drug-target interaction prediction model called molecule transformer-drug target interaction mt-dti 12 in this study we applied our pre-trained mt-dti model to identify commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially disrupt sars-cov-2s viral components such as proteinase rna-dependent rna polymerase andor helicase since the model utilizes simplified molecular-input line-entry system smiles strings and amino acid aa sequences which are 1d string inputs it is possible to quickly apply target proteins that do not have experimentally confirmed 3d crystal structures such as viral proteins of sars-cov-2 we share a list of top commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially hinder the multiplication cycle of sars-cov-2 with the hope that effective drugs can be developed based on these ai-proposed drug candidates and act against sars-cov-2 amino acid sequences of 3c-like proteinase accession yp0097253011 rna-dependent rna polymerase accession yp0097253071 helicase accession yp0097253081 3-to-5 exonuclease accession yp0097253091 endornase accession yp0097253101 and 2-o-ribose methyltransferase accession yp0097253111 of the sars-cov-2 replication complex were extracted from the sars-cov-2 whole genome sequence accession nc0455122 from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database molecule transformer-drug target interaction mt-dti was used to predict binding affinity values between commercially available antiviral drugs and target proteins mt-dti is based on the self-attention mechanism that showed remarkable success in natural language process nlp literature mt-dti is inspired by the idea that for a chemist understanding a molecule sequence is analogous to understanding a language to apply the nlp model to drug-target interaction dti tasks mt-dti is pre-trained with chemical language represented as smiles of approximately 1000000000 compounds similar to the nlp model which successfully extracts complex patterns from word sequences mt-dti successfully finds useful information in dti tasks therefore it shows the best performance and most robust results in diverse dti datasets according to a previous study 12 to train the model the drug target common dtc database 13 and bindingdb 14 database were manually curated and combined three types of efficacy value ki kd and ic50 were integrated by a consistence-score-based averaging algorithm 15 to make the pearson correlation score over 09 in terms of ki kd and ic50 since the bindingdb database includes a wide variety of species and target proteins the mt-dti model has the potential power to predict interactions between antiviral drugs and sars-cov-2 proteins after the mt-dti prediction the raw prediction results were screened for antiviral drugs that are fda approved target viral proteins and have a kd value  1000 nm smiles containing salt forms were excluded from the final results as the prediction is focused to pairs of a single molecule and the target protein in addition remdesivir was also incoprated in the analysis as its therapeutic potential to covid-19 is recently suggested by wang et al 16 and gliead sciences announcements httpswwwgileadcompurposeadvancing-global-healthcovid-19 autodock vina version 112 which is a molecular docking and virtual screening application 17 was used to predict binding affinities kcalmol between 3c-like proteinase of sars-cov-2 and 3410 fda-approved drugs smiles of 3410 fda-approved drugs were converted to the pdbqt format using open babel version 232 18 with the following options --gen3d and -p 74 the hydrogens were added to the 3c-like proteinase model using mgltools version 156 19 then binding affinities between the protein and fda-approved drugs were calculated using autodock vina the exhaustiveness parameter was set to 10 to identify potent fda-approved drugs that may inhibit the functions of sars-cov-2s core proteins we used the mt-dti deep learning-based model which can accurately predict binding affinities based on chemical sequences smiles and amino acid sequences fasta of a target protein without their structural information 12 this deep learning-based approach is particularly useful since it does not require protein structural information which can be a bottleneck for identifying drugs targeted for uncharacterized proteins with traditional three-dimensional 3d structure-based docking approaches 20 neverthless mt-dti showed the best performance 12 when compared to a deep learning-based deepdta approach 21 and two traditional machine learning-based algorithms simboost 22 and kronrls 23 with the kiba 24 and davis 25 data sets taking advantage of this sequence-based drug-target affinity prediction approach binding affinities of 3410 fda-approved drugs against 3c-like proteinase rdrp helicase 3-to-5 exonuclease endornase and 2-o-ribose methyltransferase of sars-cov-2 were predicted to confirm the performance of mt-dti at least in silico we compared the binding affinities of 3410 fda-approved drugs predicted by mt-dti to those estimated by autodock vina a widely used 3d structure-based docking algorithm it was possible since the 3d structure of the 3c-like proteinase protein was recently unveiled by the x-ray crystallography pdbid 6lu7 26 significant negative correlations meaning that the results of both algorithms showed moderate similarities higher is better for mt-dti whereas lower is better for autodock vina were observed in both the antiviral drug dataset r  034 and p-value  00071 and the fda-approved drug dataset r  032 and p-value  22e16 fig 1 while it is not possible to determine which algorithm is more reliable without various experimental evaluations a previous study showed that the mt-dti model is one of the best deep learning-based models that can predict the binding affinity between a given protein and compound 12 therefore we further applied the mt-dti model to repurpose those fda-approved drugs that have the potential to inhibit key proteins of sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2 3c-like proteinase was predicted to bind with atazanavir kd 9494 nm followed by remdesivir efavirenz ritonavir and other antiviral drugs that have a predicted affinity of kd  100 nm potency table 1 no other protease inhibitor antiviral drug was found in the kd  1000 nm range although there is no real-world evidence about whether these drugs will act as predicted against covid-19 yet some case studies have been identified for example a docking study of lopinavir along with other hiv proteinase inhibitors of the cov proteinase pdbid 1uk3 suggests atazanavir and ritonavir which are listed in the present prediction results may inhibit the cov proteinase in line with the inhibitory potency of lopinavir 27 according to the prediction viral proteinase-targeting drugs were predicted to act more favorably on the viral replication process than viral proteinase through the dti model table 2 table 3 table 4 table 5 table 6 the results include antiviral drugs other than proteinase inhibitors such as guanosine analogues eg acyclovir ganciclovir and penciclovir reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors among the prediction results atazanavir was predicted to have a potential binding affinity to bind to rna-dependent rna polymerase kd 2183 nm helicase kd 2592 nm 3-to-5 exonuclease kd 8236 nm 2-o-ribose methyltransferase kd of 39067 nm and endornase kd 5032 nm which suggests that all subunits of the covid-19 replication complex may be inhibited simultaneously by atazanavir table 2 table 3 table 4 table 5 table 6 also ganciclovir was predicted to bind to three subunits of the replication complex of the covid-19 rna-dependent rna polymerase kd 1191 nm 3-to-5 exonuclease kd 5629 nm and rna helicase kd 10821 nm lopinavir and ritonavir active materials of abbvies kaletra both were predicted to have a potential affinity to covid-19 helicase table 3 and are suggested as potential mers therapeutics 28 recently approximately 2 million worth of kaletra doses were donated to china 29 and a previous clinical study of sars by chu et al 30 may support this decision 30 another anti-hiv drug prezcobix of johnson  johnson which consists of darunavir and cobicistat was to be sent to china 29 and darunavir is also predicted to have a kd of 9038 nm against covid-19s helicase table 3 however there was no current supporting literature found for darunavir to be used as a cov therapeutic although remdesivir is not a fda approved drug its predicted potency to covid-19 resulted as follows against rna-dependent rna polymerase kd 2017 nm helicase kd 648 nm 3-to-5 exonuclease kd 4520 nm 2-o-ribose methyltransferase kd of 13439 nm and endornase kd 7027 nm in many cases dti prediction models serve as a tool to repurpose drugs to develop novel usages of existing drugs the application of dti prediction in the present study may be useful to control unexpected and rapidly spreading infections such sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and sars-cov-2 at the frontline of the disease control until better therapeutic measures are developed several recent studies have identified promising drug candidates that may help reduce symptoms of covid-19 by inhibiting some aspects of sars-cov-2 for example remdesivir and chloroquine showed inhibitory effects against sars-cov-2 in vitro
31 another in-vitro study showed that hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine for inhibiting sars-cov-2 32 remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir kaletra also reduced pneumonia-associated symptoms of some covid-19 patients 33 34 however these studies are based on previous knowledge that these drugs showed some inhibitory effects on similar coronaviruses such as sars-cov andor mers-cov in contrast our approach was truly based on a pre-trained mt-dti deep-learning model that understands drug-target interactions without domain knowledge 12 in fact mt-dti successfully identified the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr-targeted drugs that are used in clinics in top-30 predicted candidates among 1794 chemical compounds registered in the drugbank database in a previous study 12 suggesting that 3d structural information of proteins andor molecules is not necessarily required to predict drug-target interactions our results showed the following intriguing findings that need to be tested experimentally and clinically in the near future first mt-dti generally showed similar results overall compared to the conventional 3d structure-based prediction model autodock vina but some differences were observed for example atazanavir remdesivir and efavirenz were the top three predicted drugs that may bind to the 3c-like proteinase of sars-cov-2 this is while saquinavir nelfinavir and grazoprevir were the top three drugs identified by autodock vina fig 1 secondly when the search space was expanded to all fda-approved drugs some immunosuppressant drugs rapamycin and everolimus and a drug tiotropium bromide for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd were identified as promising candidates by mt-dti in contrast autodock vina predicted purmorphanime lumacaftor and verrucarin a were the top three drugs that could bind to the 3c-like proteinase of sars-cov-2 however there is currently no supporting evidence that these drugs may be effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 lastly atazanavir appears to be effective in the treatment of covid-19 by showing overall high binding affinities among tested antivirals for six proteins of sars-cov-2 including 3c-like proteinase and the replication complex components table 1 table 2 table 3 table 4 table 5 table 6 table 6 and s16 but this prediction also needs to be validated in vitro in vivo and in a wide range of clinical trials for efficacy and safety we hope our prediction results may support experimental therapeutic options for china and other countries suffering from the sars-cov-2 pandemic and align with recent clinical trials 35 bo ram beck data curation writing - original draft bonggun shin conceptualization methodology software yoonjung choi methodology writing - review  editing sungsoo park conceptualization methodology data curation software keunsoo kang conceptualization methodology writing - original draft writing - review  editing beck br choi y and park s are employed by company deargen inc shin b is employed by deargen inc as a part-time advisor kang k is one of the co-founders of and a shareholder in deargen inc  pulmonary delivery of nanostructured lipid carriers for effective repurposing of salinomycin as an antiviral agent sai pindiprolu kiran chirravuri kumar s venu kumar golla sampath likitha pindiproli rk ramachandra   coronaviruses covs are enveloped single-stranded rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae within the order nidovirales coronaviruses cov are of four different genera    and  covs among these  covs like sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is responsible for severe and potentially fatal respiratory infections1 2 3

 it was reported that covs enter host cells angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 receptor-mediated endocytosis which is a ph-dependent process in this process spike s protein plays a major role in receptor binding and membrane fusion of sars-cov-2 for entry into host cells it contains a large ectodomain transmembrane anchor and a short intracellular tail the ectodomain of sars-cov-2 consists of two subunits s1 subunit of sars-cov-2 is responsible for binding with the ace-2 receptor for viral entry to host cells following receptor binding the sars-cov-2 enter the cytosol of the host cell by ph-dependent proteolytic cleavage of spike protein by tmprss2 then the fusion of viral and host cell membranes occurs in acidified endosomes allowing viral genomes to affect host cells with the aid of the s2 subunit 1 4 5 coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 was the pandemic affected nearly 1400000 people worldwide as on 7 april 2020 according to who however rapid spread potential mortality and lack of clinically approved drugs and vaccines against covid-19 are the major challenges there is a need therefore for quick discovery of drugs against this emerging infectious disease however the slow phase of discovery and associated costs are the major challenges in discovering drugs against sars-cov-2 drug repurposing using existing drugs is an attractive strategy to accelerate drug discovery against covid-19 recently researchers focused on screening of fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 6 7 8 salinomycin sal is a carboxylic polyether ionophore isolated from streptomyces albus ionophores show a broad spectrum of bioactivity like antibacterial antifungal antiparasitic antiviral and recently they are also used as anti-tumor agents 9 however poor absorption low bioavailability and off-target effects are the potential limitations for effective repurposing of sal as an antiviral agent against sars-cov-2 in the present study we therefore propose the pulmonary delivery of sal using nanostructured lipid carriers nlcs in the present study we proposed to prepare nlcs for intra-pulmonary delivery of sal to prevent sars-cov-2 infection fig 1

 for all enveloped viruses the significant step of entry into host cell is fusion sars-cov-2 fusion occurs in low ph with a half-maximal rate of fusion at ph 55 a compelling body of evidence suggests sal inhibits replication of viral rna in the cytoplasm by altering the ph sal therefore has the potential to prevent the entry of sars-cov-2 into the cytosol and prevent membrane fusion a ph-dependent process 18 it was reported that sal has antiviral propensity by preventing the migration of nuclear protein np to form a viral ribonuclear complex vnp this fails to acidify the endosomal-lysosomal compartments due to cytoplasmic accumulation of np in the host cells 18 19 it was also reported that sal could interact with s- protein and influence ace2 binding and prevent the release of viral rna into the cytoplasm 20 besides a recent drug screen identified sal as a potential antiviral agent against sars-cov-2 ic50024m19 however the clinical efficacy of sal against sars-cov-2 needs to be evaluated pulmonary delivery is an attractive strategy for localized delivery of therapeutics to infection sites besides inhaled nanoparticles overcomes the limitations of poor bioavailability and drug absorption nlcs are biocompatible nanocarriers with good tolerability for pulmonary delivery due to their size in nanometers nlcs can be easily aerosolized into droplets with suitable aero-dynamical properties this enables deep lung deposition of an active compound furthermore nlcs adhere to the mucosal surface of the lung for a more extended period compared to larger particles due to the small size particle adhesion accumulation and retention in the lung as well as prolonged-release due to nlcs results in enhanced and sustained therapeutic effects nlcs have advantage of better patient compliance 21 22 23 24 25 all these advantages of inhaled nlcs play an essential role in the treatment of respiratory infections like covid-19 there are several investigational drugs and drugs under preclinical trials for preventioncurative purposes of covid-19 but still there is no current approved drug sal has the ability to disruption concentration across the cell membrane and prevents virus entry into the host cells by selective targeting of sal encapsulation of sal in nlc for pulmonary delivery is an attractive approach for effective repurposing of sal as an antiviral agent by improving its absorption at the infection site none to declare  fight against novel coronavirus a perspective of medicinal chemists sk amin abdul tarun jha   coronaviruses covs typically cause mild to severe respiratory and intestinal infections in mammals including humans 1 2 it belongs to the family coronaviridae which comes under the order nidovirales 3 4 covs are classified into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus the first two genera ie alpha- and betacoronavirus mainly infect mammals whereas gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses foul avian species more than 60 years have passed since the identification of first human cov hcov was documented as a respiratory tract modulator 5 6 in december 2019 several clusters epidemiologically associated with a seafood and animal market in wuhan china of patients suffering fever illness severe respiratory tract infections and pneumonia of unknown origin were reported 7 8 9 10 11 12 this finally leaded to the isolation of a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and the disease recently named as covid-19 world health organization who already characterized covid-19 as world pandemic 13 this infection has spread over to 216 countries and territories 14 before covid-19 outbreak there were six species of hcovs that were reported for their association with respiratory tract infections table 1
 these six hcovs strains are - a hcov-229e b hcov-oc43 c hcov- hong kong university 1 hcov-hku1 d hcov-nl63 e severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov sars-cov and f middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov mers-cov 15 the seventh strain of hcov is novel coronavirus 2019-ncov aka sars-cov-2 which is taxonomically belongs to the betacoronavirus genre and possesses high nucleotide sequence similarity with sars-cov and mers-cov 16 17 18 19 20 sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses surrounded by an envelope figure 1
 sars-cov-2 about 30000 bp single-stranded rna virus utilizes host cellular components to accomplish its physiological affairs such as viral entry the assembly and budding of virions genomic replication and protein synthesis subsequently executes pathological damage to the host 21 22 23 thus punctuating any juncture of viral life cycle by small molecules peptides vaccines or physical elements may potentially gain therapeutic benefit to host depending on several viral targets figure 1 related to the stages of viral life cycle novel anti-viral agents may be designed and discovered nonetheless different structure-based modeling techniques and numerous ligand-based computational techniques may be fruitful strategy to design newer inhibitors against sars-cov-2 24 25 26 meanwhile the hefty menace posed by current outbreak of covid-19 it is obvious that the scientific community is looking for effective drugs within plausible time the coherent development and well organised strategies remains the only hope to triumph the battle against partially known sars-cov-2 now repurposing of existing anti-viral drugs based on previous ground work of closely related coronavirus and rapid screening of drug databases is one of the strategic and economic ways to eradicate covid-19 pandemic 27 28 29 the traditional bioinformatics and chemo-informatics approaches readily generated new data into sars-cov-2 research at an explosive pace considering the severity of the spread of covid-19 this study is in-line with the concept of finding the chemo-types to expedite the process of anti-hcov drug discovery here an exquisite picture of the recent research including target-based and biological screening is provided we includes virtual in silico as well as experimental in vitro screening approaches in response to sars-cov-2 reported until april 2020 the main aim is to provide the scientific community with an overview of the medicinal chemistry of sars-cov-2 to allow the rapid development of anti-viral agents this work a part of our rational drug design and discovery 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 is an initiative to pave the way of anti-sars-cov-2 drug discovery paradigm that could help to facilitate the global efforts to fight against covid-19 the details structural biology of the sars-cov-2 virus is yet to be discovered it contains a 30000 bp single-stranded positive sense rna genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope figure 1 37 38 39 it recruits multi-subunit replication machinery 40 the genome of sars-cov-2 comprises about 30000 nucleotides with ten open reading frames orfs the 3 terminal regions encodes for several structural proteins including spike s membrane envelope e and nucleo-capsid n proteins figure 1 whereas the 5 terminal orf1ab responsible for two viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b upon proteolytic cleavage of these two viral replicase polyproteins fabricate sixteen non-structural proteins nsp figure 2
 37 currently there are no broad spectrum inhibitors of sars-cov-2 viral proteins are reported mainly five sars-cov-2 targets are being investigated including receptor binding domain rbdspike protein n protein e protein 3clpro and rdrp figure 2 41 42 43 however most of the viral proteins would be potential future targets and detailed understanding of their role is required to stimulate chemotherapeutic arbitration against hcovs a comparative list of reported crystal structures of 2019-ncov is depicted in table 2
as available from protein data bank 44 see table 3 the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus is the main conciliator of entry into the host cells 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 this spike glycoprotein contains i a large ecto-domain ii a single-pass transmembrane anchor and iii a short c-terminal intracellular tail 44 the ecto-domain consists of a receptor-binding unit s1 and a membrane-fusion s2 stalk basically the receptor-binding unit s1 binds to a specific cell surface receptor via its receptor binding domain rbd whereas the trimeric s2 fuses the viral membranes and host cell to enable the entry of viral genomes into host cells figure 2 researchers already identified angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a functional receptor for sars-cov 48 49 50 51 the crowned shaped spike glycoprotein of covs binds directly to ace2 on the host cells surface and plays critically in virus infection ace2 is expressed widely with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom ace2 from fish amphibians reptiles birds to mammals can potentially interact with rbd of sars-cov-2 44 therefore blocking of the rbd and ace2 interaction is an obvious therapeutic intervention to treat diseases caused by covs specific antibodies or small molecular inhibitors can disrupt the interaction of rbd with ace2 among the set of sixteen non-structural proteins nsp5 is identified to play a pivotal role in the life cycle of sars-cov-2 replication as well as maturation figure 2 being a key component the nsp5 is termed as main protease mpro like other rna viruses the functional significance of this mpro or chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro of sars-cov-2 emerges as an attractive drug target for the development of anti-viral agents recently the 3d structure of 3clpro of sars-cov-2 was reported 1 like other coronaviruses mpro it also consists of three domains the domain i comprising of 8-101 amino acids and ii 102-184 amino acids are anti-parallel -barrels resembling the chymotrypsin besides the domain iii 201-306 amino acids essentially comprehended of five -helices and arrayed into a antiparallel globular cluster interestingly a long loop region 185200 residues bridged domain ii and iii the substrate-binding pocket of sars-cov-2 virus mpro is located in a cleft between domain i and ii 1 the binding site possesses a cys-his catalytic dyad with other crucial amino acid residues including f140 l141 n142 g143 s144 m165 e166 q189 and t190 the nsp12 of sars-cov-2 encoded viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 boasts polymerase activity figure 2 rdrp is a pivotal enzyme in the life cycle of all rna viruses including cov human immune deficiency virus hiv hepatitis c virus hcv and zika virus zikv gao and co-workers 40 reported the cryo-em structure of full-length nsp12 of sars-cov in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 the active site domain of the sars-cov-2 rdrp is set up by conserved polymerase motifs a-g in the palm domain 40 rdrp active site is appointing two successive aspartate residues projected from a beta-turn structure making them surface accessible through the nucleotide channel as configured to sars-cov the rdrp of sars-cov-2 contains a larger n-terminal extension and polymerase domain multiple sequence alignment msa of sars-cov-2 rdrp disclosed percent sequence identity against different hcov strains such as the alpha-coronavirus 229e 4855 and nl63 4879 and the beta-coronavirus oc43 5507 hku1 4816 mers-cov 5676 and sars-cov 9018 thus the sars-cov rdrp is the closest strain to the rdrp of sars-cov-2 53 this structural information may furnish a basis for the design of new anti-covid-19 agents or drug repurposing against viral proteins chen and co-workers 44 suggested unique structural features of the spike glycoprotein rbd of sars-cov-2 however the rbds of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share 72 amino acid sequences identity and disclose highly similar ternary structures on the contrary sars-cov-2 exhibits a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in sars-cov molecular modeling study unfolded that a phenylalanine moiety phe486 in the flexible loop involves critically in its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket of ace2 this observation may partially confer a stronger interaction between sars-cov-2 and ace2 of the host cell moreover spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 exhibits higher binding affinity for its receptor in comparison to other covs 44 these suggest the aggressiveness of sars-cov-2 than sars-cov-1 this observation was in line with the analysis of xu et al 44 where the computational model of rbd domain of the sars-cov-2 s protein established strong interaction with human ace2 robson 54 performed a preliminary bioinformatics studies to propose a synthetic vaccine and peptidomimetic antagonist against the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 the author employed q-uel language to perform the bioinformatics approach krsfiedllfnkv was identified as a well conserved sequence motif that corresponds to the known cleavage sites of the sars virus this sequence motif formed the basis for design of specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent 54 a group of scientists from the cairo university egypt predicted covid-19 spike binding site to a cell-surface receptor namely glucose regulated protein 78 grp78 by employing structural bioinformatics in combination with protein-protein docking 55 firstly a homology model of sars-cov-2 spike protein was built by using sars-cov spike pdb 6acd chain c as a template further sequence and structural alignments with the pep42 cyclic peptide hypothesized four cyclic region starting and ending with cysteine residues connected by a disulfide bond of sars-cov-2 spike protein as possible binding sites to grp78 the protein-protein docking by haddock software revealed the involvement of the substrate binding domain  sbd  of grp78 pdb 5e84 and the receptor-binding domain of the sars-cov-2 spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor moreover the favourable binding was observed between regions iii c391-c525 and iv c480- c488 of sars-cov-2 spike protein model and grp78 notably the region iv was supposed to be a pivotal driving force for grp78 binding predicted binding affinity -98 kcalmol prediction of this binding site sheds light on the mode of envelope protein recognition by the grp78 substrate-binding domain for future endeavours 55 in a molecular modeling study to explore potential inhibitors of rna binding to n terminal domain ntd of nucleocapsid protein n protein sarma et al 56 pointed out two potential hits namely zinc000003118440 and zinc000000146942 figure 3
 the authors employed two ntd structures of n proteins namely 2ofz and 1ssk firstly a set of diverse compounds from asinex and maybridge library were docked then 15 compounds for each of the targets were prioritized with significant docking scores further mm-gbsa binding free energy pharmacokinetic properties qikprop drug-likeness swissadme and molecular dynamics md studies were performed to screen the compounds out of these two potential hits one compound was a theophylline derivative since theophylline derivative is commonly used as a bronchodilator hence the author further screened approved bronchodilators against the n protein rna binding site of covid-19 56 the approved bronchodilators showed mm-gbsa binding affinity in the following order formeterol terbutaline  ipratropium bromide tiotropium bromide  theophylline  salbutamol recently native or non-native protein-protein interactions ppis are emerged as a target for structure-based screening of small molecule it may be an alternative drug design paradigm which could accelerate anti-viral drug discovery against various pathogens 57 58 59 since the orthostaticallosteric stabilization of non-native ppis of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein results abnormal protein oligomerizaion and finally leading to loss of viral activity scientists from national chung hsing university taiwan acclaimed non-native ppis of n-terminal domain of the mers-cov nucleocapsid protein mers-cov n-ntd 60 they reported a crystal structure of mers-cov n-ntd in a non-native dimeric configuration which turned a target for virtual screening of orthosteric stabilizers from acros and zinc drug databases this finding provides valuable insight and further motivations into the design of new anti-virals based on stabilizing a non-native protein interaction interface of n protein 60 gupta and co-workers 61 employed computational techniques to explore the best possible structure of the sars-cov2 e protein present in the pdb database the author reported that e protein of sars-cov-2 is a pentameric protein comprised of 35 -helices and 40 loops near about 8000 compounds were docked whereas 700 compounds were prioritized with significant affinities or docking scores the docking study with e protein of sars-cov-2 and phytochemicals like belachinal macaflavanone e vibsanol divulged that amino acids such as v25 and f26 play crucially in the binding interactions the functional behaviour of e protein of sars-cov-2 after 200ns molecular dynamics studies revealed that -helix and loops of e protein escapades random movement and modulates normal ion channel activity to succour the pathogenesis in human and other vertebrates unlikely the random manoeuvre of the e protein of sars-cov-2 gets reduced after binding with inhibitors 61 khan et al 62 pinpointed three fda-approved drugs such as remdesivir saquinavir and darunavir and two small molecules flavone and coumarin derivatives as possible inhibitors of 3clpro by target-based virtual screening a number of 8000 compounds were docked and top 700 primary hits were distinguished by significant affinities or docking scores then the binding interaction between the active site residue of 3clpro and the selected compounds were extensively scrutinized using the plif module in moe further md simulation and binding free energy calculations were recorded to evaluate the dynamic behaviour stability of protein-ligand contact and binding affinity of the hit compounds 62 kandeel and al-nazawi 63 reported statistics of pairwise sequence comparison matrix among the main protease mpro of covs a high pairwise sequence alignment identity 9608 was found between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 mpro whereas only 5161 identity was exposed for sars-cov-2 and mers-cov mpro in consequence the number of amino acid differences between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 mpro was only 12 while it was 153 between sars-cov-2 and mers-cov mpro an early virtual screening vs study of fda approved drugs retrieved from selleckchem inc against the first resolved sars-cov-2 mpro crystal structure pdb 6lu7 was performed that helps the repurposing of already approved drugs to eradicate covid-19 63 fda approved drugs were de-slated and optimized using opls2005 force field by the aid of ligprep software similarly the protein was optimized by protein preparation module in maestro software package schrodinger llc ny usa the standard precision sp docking of schrodinger glide docking module was employed for vs depending on the highest docking score top 20 fda approved drugs were highlighted including chromocarb a vasoprotective ribavirin antiviral agent telbivudine anti-hepatitis b virus vitamin b12 and nicotinamide vitamin aminophylline bronchodilator triflusal cardiovascular drug bemegride cns stimulant aminosalicylate sodium and pyrazinamide antituberculosis agents temozolomide anticancer methazolamide used in glaucoma tioxolone anti-acne agent propylthiouracil antithyroid agent cysteaminehcl nephropathiccystinosis methoxamine hydrochloride alpha-adrenergic agonist zonisamide anticonvulsant --octopaminehcl adrenergic agonist amiloride hydrochloride diuretic detailed scanning of the binding mode of these drugs with sars-cov-2 mpro conferred that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions were the main imperators for binding interestingly telbivudine figure 3 an anti-hepatitis b virus agent bind with the sars-cov-2 mpro through hydrogen bond interactions with amino acid residues s49 and q189 moreover a broad spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin figure 3 interacted with the sars-cov-2 mpro by forming hydrogen bonds with side chain amino acid residue q189 and the backbone amino acid residue t25 ribavirin is officially approved against respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection it is also used in combination with interferon 2b against hepatitis c virus moreover it also exhibited potency against sars-cov infection 63 in a study to distinguish potential active herbs against 2019-ncov ma et al 64 performed molecular docking based virtual screening of traditional chinese medicine database tcmd 2009 by cdocker program against 3clpro and papain-like protease plpro of sars-cov-2 the vs study against mpro screened 12322 active components on the other hand vs approach against plpro screened 11294 potential ingredients and representative active ingredients included ginger ketophenol ginkgol alcohol ferulic acid etc 64 deep docking dd methodology that enable fast prediction of docking scores and expand the repertoire of structure-based vs of billions of compound in a very short time a group of scientists from the university of british columbia canada 65 applied dd method to screen 13 billion compounds from zinc15 library and recognized top 1000 hits against mpro of sars-cov-2 pdb 6lu7 upon careful observation of the interaction between zinc000541677852 figure 3 and sars-cov-2 mpro conferred that the p1 p2 and p3 groups occupied the binding pocket by forming hydrophobic interactions in addition it formed hydrogen bond interactions with three backbone amino acid residues c145 l141 h164 and one side chain amino acid residue q192 65 shah and co-workers 66 selected sars-cov-2 mpro proteins pdb 5r7y 5r7z 5r80 5r81 5r82 having resolution  2  r-value free  030 r-value work  025 to perform molecular docking study of 61 anti-viral agents the maestro interface schrdinger suite llc ny was used to perform the molecular docking study compounds exhibited dock score of 65 or less were taken as promising molecules this comparative analysis suggested that asunaprevir indinavir galidesivir lopinavir remdesivir ritonavir abt450 cgp42112a and marboran methisazone interacted with 2 sars-cov-2 mpro structures moreover an anti-hiv drug lopinavir showed binding affinities for all five structures with a dock score of less than 65 whereas indinavir and ritonavir figure 4
 interacted with 4 out of 5 proteins in addition methisazone an inhibitor of protein synthesis cgp42112a an angiotensin at2 receptor agonist and abt450 an inhibitor of the non-structural protein 3-4a may be emerged as a new hits against sars-cov-2 66 a scientist from cairo university egypt performed homology modelling of sars-cov-2 rdrp by the aid of swiss model a automated homology modelling web server using sars-cov-1 rdrp pdb 6nur chain a as a template 52 the resulted sars-cov-2 rdrp homology model expressed 9708 sequence identity to the template the model was validated based on the ramachandran plot which showed 100 of the residues in the allowed regions 975 in the most favoured region further the molecular docking was employed by utilizing autodock vina to test some direct-acting antiviral daa drugs including sofosbuvir ribavirin remidisvir idx-184 against covid-19 rdrp a grid box was chosen at the sars-cov-2 rdrp by utilizing the autodock tools using x y z coordinates of 1421 1387 1500 respectively in 30  30  30  dimensions the active site aspartates d255 and d256 were kept flexible during the docking study the optimization of the ligands were performed using mm3 and pm6 force field after that further optimization was carried out through b3lyp functional of density functional theory dft based quantum mechanics the binding energies and interaction complexes formed after docking conferred that idx-184 sofosbuvir and ribavirin can tightly bind to the rdrp of sars-cov-2 interestingly guanosine derivative idx-184 sofosbuvir and ribavirin interacted with rdrp through multiple hydrogen bonding additionally sofosbuvir and idx-184 form metal interaction through the mg2 with e702 and d652 respectively sofosbuvir exhibit two hydrophobic interactions with d651and y510 whereas idx-184 form a salt bridge d514 which referred for the increased stabilization of the interactions hence strong binding with sars-cov-2 rdrp these agents can contradict the function of rdrp in the life cycle of 2019-ncov viruses leading to viral eradication 52 in another study elfiky 67 reported sars-cov-2 rdrp targeted molecular docking study of some anti-polymerase drugs which have been approved for use against various viruses not surprisingly ribavirin remdesivir sofosbuvir galidesivir and tenofovirexhibited promising binding affinity against sars-cov-2 rdrp these results were also consistence with previous one 52 guanosine derivative idx-184 setrobuvir yak has potential to block the sarscov-2 strain since these drugs have already passed the adme and toxicity measurements these may be used as a new therapeutic drug candidate against sars-cov-2 lung and co-workers 68 identified theaflavin a polyphenolic constituent present in black tea against rdrp after screening eighty-three chemical structures from traditional chinese medicinal compounds along with their similar structures retrieved from zinc15 database the three-dimensional rdrp structures of sars-cov-2 ncbi yp0097253071 sars-cov np8288691 and mers-cov yp0090472231 were modelled using modeller 7 after molecular docking with idock httpsgithubcomhongjianliidock the theaflavin showed promising binding energy against rdrp of sars-cov-2 idock score -911 kcalmol mers-cov idock score -826 kcalmol and sars-cov idock score -803 kcalmol hydrophobic interactions were found to be the driving force in binding theaflavin formed hydrogen bonds with d452 r553 and r624 of sars-cov-2 rdrp additionally a -cation interaction was found with r553 68 calligari et al 69 cashed in the molecular docking technique to examine the affinity of several inhibitors previously developed for another viral pathogen to sars-cov-2 viral proteins the main 3c-like protease s protein rdrp nucleocapsid protein hiv inhibitors saquinavir db01232 autodock vina scoring -93 kcalmol indinavir db00224 vina scoring 87 kcalmol tipranavir db00932 vina scoring 86 kcalmol ritonavir db00503 vina

db01264 vina scoring 76 kcalmol fosamprenavir db01319 vina scoring 72 kcalmol were identified as promising molecules against sars-cov-2 mpro this results were also consistence with hepatitis c virus hcv inhibitors faldaprevir db11808 vina scoring 84 kcalmol and asunaprevir db11586 vina scoring 81 kcalmol surprisingly hcv ns34a protease inhibitor simeprevir db06290 autodockvina scoring 100 kcalmol was recognised as the best autodock vina scoring drug in spite of hcv main protease measure very low identity with the sars-cov-2 homolog only 75 thus this finding was thunderbolt 69 therefore it may be inferred that the similar topology of active site of both proteases was the main driving force in binding of simeprevir it fitted well into the two hydrophobic pockets fringed the catalytic dyad h41-c145 of sars-cov-2 mpro it was also fitted into the hydrophobic loop f181-f185 moreover the binding of simeprevir to sars-cov-2 protease was anchored by three hydrogen bonding interactions with e166 g143 and n142 69 in the same article the homology modelling of sars-cov-2 s protein by the aid of itasser server was done by using sars-cov spike pdb 5wrg 5  58 5xlr as a template global pairwise sequence alignment measured that sars-cov-2 s protein shares about 76 of its primary sequence with its homolog in addition an overall similarity of 87 autodock vina molecular docking of the homology modelled structure of s protein predicted umifenovir db13609 enfuvirtide db00109 and pleconaril db05105 as potential inhibitors 69 in a study to repurposing existing drugs against current pandemic covid-19 wu et al 70 predicted some potential drugs acting on a certain target or multiple targets of sars-cov-2 bioinformatics based homology modelling was utilised to build possible targets such as viral mpro plpro rdrp helicase spike etc next these modelled proteins and human relative proteins including human ace2 and type-ii transmembrane serine protease enzymes were forwarded to systematically analyse and screen zinc drug database zdd along with database of traditional chinese medicine and natural products and the database of commonly used 78 anti-viral drugs 70 this study seems to be very interesting due to its deep discussions and vast target predictability the lead candidates emerged from this study required in vitro and in vivo studies for further conformations the new drug discovery and development takes more than five to ten years of investigations as well as cost billions of dollars thus drug repositioning is the only cheap strategy to respond immediately fda-approved drugs justify safe alternatives if at least modest anti-sars-cov-2 activity can be achieved currently academia and industry personnel are involved in the testing of  i approved drugs andor ii drug candidates in clinical trials the in vitro screenings of fda approved drugs as well as the compounds which are currently under clinical trials phases were well documented 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 and the need for further in vivo testing to facilitate drug discovery efforts against sars-cov-2 nafamostat figure 5

 has been used for more than 70 years 82 now found to shows clinical potency against covid-19 the molecular mechanism of chloroquine against sars-cov is known 83 84 very recently wang et al 72 reported time-of-addition assay that explained the function of cq ec50  113 m cc50 100 m si  8850 at both entry as well as at post-entry stages of the novel corona virus infection in vero e6 cells the same group of researches further evaluated the in vitro anti-sars-cov-2 effect of hydroxychloroquine hcq figure 6 sulphate a derivative of cq in comparison to cq 73 hydroxychloroquine sulphate 85 was introduced long before first synthesized in 1946 73 upon introduction of a hydroxyl group into cq resulted in about 40 less toxic agent than cq in animals both cq and hcq are weak bases and restrict the virus infection by- i triggering endosomal ph which is essential for viruscell fusion and ii interfering with the glycosylation of ace2 receptor and spike protein of coronavirus 73 additionally both cq and hcq obstructed the sars-cov-2 transport from early endosomes ees to endolysosomes els jinand co-workers 1 executed structure-assisted drug design molecular docking virtual screening as well as high-throughput screening to pinpoint new leads by targeting the 3clpro of sars-cov-2 the same study first time reported the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro pdb 6lu7 in complex with a mechanism-based inhibitor n3 figure 7
 a molecular docking study with pdb 6lu7 suggested that the ligand ie cinanserin a serotonin antagonist figure 7 adequately fitted into the substrate-binding site and formed two cation- interactions with his41 and glu166 of sars-cov-2 mpro this in silico observations was found in agreement with the in vitro sars-cov-2 inhibition assay where cinanserin exhibited ic50 value of 12493 m further a combination of sars-cov-2 mpro structure-based vs and high-throughput screening of more than 10000 compounds containing approved drugs clinical trials compounds and other pharmacologically active compounds picked six lead molecules as promising sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitors ic50 range 067 to 214 m among these identified inhibitors disulfiram and carmofur are fda-approved drugs whereas ebselen tideglusib shikonin tdzd-8 and px-12 are undergoing currently in preclinical studies figure 7 besides ebselen also possessed effective anti-viral activity in cell-based assays this interesting study done by jin et al 1 not only demonstrated a robust screening strategy but also open a new panorama to rapid discovery of lead molecules targeting sars-cov-2 mpro an attempt was made by su and collaborators to introduce the first sars-cov-2 mlpro crystal structure complied with a non-covalent inhibitor named baicalein 43 this compound exhibited promising sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitory activity ic50  094 m along with a dose-dependent inhibition on the replication of sars-cov-2 ec50  169 m at the receptor binding site baicalein forms interaction with catalytic glu166 and oxyanion loop residues 138145 more interestingly it exhibited very distinct binding mode than the other covalent or peptidomimetic 3clpro inhibitors 43 
in vitro screening of 48 drugs was screened against hcovs infection 71 immunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for the viral n protein of sars-cov-2 was scored for each drug treated cells the dose-response curve drc was developed after analysing the confocal microscope images of both viral n protein and cell nuclei remdesivir sars-cov-2 ic50  1141 m lopinavir sars-cov-2 ic50  912 m and chloroquine sars-cov-2 ic50  728 m were used as reference drugs consequently 24 drugs showed good activities with ic50 ranges of 01 to 10 m an anti-helminthic drug niclosamide and a corticosteroid used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis ciclesonide emerged as sars-cov-2 inhibitors with ic50 of 028 m and 433 m respectively notably niclosamide reduces mers-cov replication by inhibiting skp2 activity leading to enhancement in autophagy 86 thus a similar mechanism may be introduced by niclosamide to hamper sars-cov-2 infection 71 zhang et al 87 reported structure-based design synthesis and activity assessment of -ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication these showed good inhibitory properties against the isolated proteases viral replicons virus-infected huh7 cells near-equipotency against the enteroviruses alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses was observed upon optimization of the p2 substituent of the -ketoamides the cyclopentylmethyl and cyclohexylmethyl at the p2 substituent disposed low-micromolar ec50 values against the three virus genera in cell cultures compound 11r was found promising against mers-cov in virus-infected huh7 cells 87 by dint of high similarity among the 3clproteases of coronavirus it is awaited that compound 11r is expected to display good anti-viral activity against covid-19 in near future meanwhile the clinical trial studies of some molecules have been started against covid-19 mainly through drug repurposing 88 those are depicted in table 2 the medicinal chemistry of sars-cov-2 infection is still in its infancy with target specific lead molecules are yet to identify this study deals with the information currently available on potential targets for therapeutic invention and screening of new compounds or drug repurposing against sars-cov-2 figure 8
 as the 3d structure of the sars-cov-2 3c-like protease bears 96 identity with its ortholog from sars-cov interestingly the residues involved in the catalysis substrate binding and dimerization of 3clpro are 100 conserved in addition the polyprotein pp1ab sequences are highly similar 86 identity depending upon the alike substrate specificities and high identities we are of the opinion that the previous progress of specific sars-cov inhibitors development can undertaking a course of action on the design and discovery of inhibitors against sars-cov-2 our group have already explored the structural properties important for sars-cov viral 3clike protease inhibitors 30 recently in a collaborative work our research team suggested the implications of naphthyl derivatives against sars-cov-2 plpro enzyme though in-depth ligand-receptor interaction analysis 89 we have already predicted some in-house glutamine-based molecules to use as a seed for drug design and optimization against plpro of sars-cov-2 90 in fact some other anti-viral drugs can also be taken into consideration in this regards target-based vs is one of the most important approaches used for drug repurposing the computational analyses are not subordinate but are a right choice to enrich the basal knowledge during the long process leading to drug development figure 8 until any clear-cut treatment approach is prescribed for covid-19 the use of already approved drugs is only alternative strategy howbeit relatively limited computational resource or biased in silico screening may scattered the linearity of drug discovery of novel coronavirus in the near future the virtual hits may serve as a promising drug like molecule against sars-cov-2 after details in vitro and in vivo laboratory investigations moreover the availability of x-ray crystal structures of the important viral proteins will trigger more exhaustive docking calculation of diverse chemotypes it is crystal clear that the prevention of covid-19 requires strong and sustainable global collaborative work 91 data sharing is exigent to fill the knowledge gaps on this global pandemic further progress of the scientific understanding regarding the structural and molecular biology of sars-cov-2 will legitimate the shape of lead compounds to achieve therapeutic goals the development of medicinal chemistry

disease for developing appropriate therapeutic interventions may prevent end organ damage and long-term functional disability in those who survive severe disease autopsy and minimally invasive biopsy studies indicate that covid-19 is a multi-system disease the lungs in particular manifest significant pathological lesions such as alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation menter t et al 2020 tian s et al 2020  significant proliferation of type ii alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar and bronchial epithelia and hyaline membrane formation j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f are seen xu et al 2020  with predominantly macrophage and monocyte immune cell infiltration in alveoli with multinucleated giant cells lymphocytes mostly cd4-positive t cells and some eosinophils and neutrophils the blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested edematous and widened with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes hyaline thrombi in microvessels and focal hemorrhage in lung tissue organization of exudates and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis have been observed furthermore degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells and formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels were observed in other organs and tissues menter t et al 2020 tian s et al 2020  immunohistochemical staining showed alveolar epithelia and macrophages positive for sars-cov-2 antigen evidence of sars-cov-2 antigens in other organs and tissues has been detected which suggests that host immune responses evoked by sars-cov-2 infection are involved in the pathogenesis of multi-organ injury yao et al 2020  covid-19 like mers and sars is a systemic illness with multi-organ involvement sars-cov-2 enters the host cells via the cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the target cell surface  ace2 as a cardio-regulator so there are numerous cells with ace2 receptors in blood vessels alveolar type ii cells at2 in the lungs and several other organs such as heart kidneys it appears that all three lethal zoonotic coronaviruses mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cv-2 seem to induce excessive and aberrant host immune responses which are associated with severe lung pathology leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards li g et al 2020 li g et al

risk of mortality mehta et al 2020 ruan et al 2020  in those who survive intensive care the long-term consequences of these aberrant and excessive immune responses may lead to long term pulmonary damage and fibrosis with functional disability and reduction of quality of life it is important that therapeutic interventions which can dampen the excess j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f inflammation thus preventing end organ damage and long-term functional disability in those who survive severe disease for the past decade the medical and pharma communities have focused on developing therapeutics targeting the pathogen rather than on the role of underlying host factors zumla et al 2016a 2016b  human immune defenses are dependent on a complex array of mechanical innate and acquired immune

to discover therapeutics for covid-19 using deep learning there have been more than 22 million confirmed cases and over 120000 deaths from the human coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 in the united states alone however there are currently lack of proven effective medications against covid-19 drug repurposing offers a promising way for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for covid-19 this study reports an integrative network-based deep learning methodology to identify repurposable drugs for covid-19 termed cov-kge specifically we built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs diseases proteinsgenes pathways and expression from a large scientific corpus of 24 million pubmed publications using amazons aws computing resources and a network-based deep learning framework we identified 41 repurposable drugs including dexamethasone indomethacin niclosamide and toremifene whose therapeutic association with covid-19 were validated by transcriptomic and proteomic data in sars-cov-2 infected human cells and data from ongoing clinical trials while this study by no means recommends specific drugs it demonstrates a powerful deep learning methodology to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation

structurebased drug repositioning who world health organization the newly identified coronavirus sarscov2 causes severe pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019covid19 and has rapidly spread across the world from the initial outbreak point in wuhan china in late 2019 1 it has become a global health emergency and on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared a pandemic status of this novel coronavirus outbreak since no approved drug that is specifically targeted to this virus exists at this point in time drug repositioningrepurposing is thought to be the most effective and feasible approach toward this clear and present threat and researchers have initiated studies by employing various means in order to find potential therapeutics 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 the sarscov2 genome is very close to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov 1 from the past efforts to cure rna virus infections including the experiences from the sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers epidemics several potential target proteins and drugs have been proposed 12 13 the 3clike main proteinase surface glycoprotein 8 and rnadependent rna polymerase are thought to be the most promising targets for anticovid19 therapeutics for example the antihiv drug lopinavirritonavir which has been proposed to treat sars 14 15 is expected to be effective toward sarscov2 3clike proteinase 16 17 additionally the antiviral drug remdesivir is expected to target the rnadependent rna polymerase 18 the recent studies on drug repositioningrepurposing involve a variety of computational methods such as network analysis text mining machine learning and structurebased drug repositioning sbdr 19 20 21 22 23 24 among these methods sbdr is the most promising to find specific drugs toward a defined target protein and it prompted the quick structure analyses of sarscov2 3clike proteinase and surface glycoprotein 8 25 although structure analyses of many other sarscov2 proteins would soon follow predictions of other protein structures with homologyknowledgebased theoretical methods would be required until structure analyses are completed especially for the proteins currently out of focus as drug targets in the presented study therefore the homology models of sarscov2 proteins and their ligand complexes were comprehensively constructed also the structural models of the complexes between sarscov2 proteins and potential drugs were proposed by comparing the ligand molecules of the proteins and approved experimental or natural drugs the amino acid sequences of sarscov2 proteins table 1 were retrieved from the refseq database at ncbi 26 and structural modeling templates were sought with the sird system httpsirdnagahama-i-bioacjpsird which accepted multiple query sequences and sought for similar sequences more than 30 sequence identity to query with known structures in the protein data bank pdb 27 by using blast 28 this system also sought for the templates of protein complex structures in which two or more proteins in the multiple query were associated or any ligand bound to query proteins the coordinates of template structures were obtained from the pdb 27 and were rendered into the biological quaternary structures initial structural models were constructed by using modeller 29 in some cases the resultant models contain residues with rare dihedral angles ramachandran outliers rare shape of side chains rotamer outliers and short atomatom distances atomic crashes then the models were further modified by iteratively applying molecular dynamics and geometry minimization procedures of phenix 30 to eliminate aforementioned outliers and finally manual model modifications with visual inspection on coot for resolving rotamer outliers or atomic crashes 31 the model quality was evaluated with molprobity 32 the percentages of rotamer outlier ramachandran outlier and crash score were monitored for each model to achieve less than 2 005 and 5 respectively the molecular formula of 8085 drugs in total was retrieved from the kegg database 33 and the drugbank database 34 the molecular formula of 5780 metabolites in total which have been used for natural medicines natural drugs was obtained from the knapsack database 35 the structures of the ligand molecules in the known complex structures as sought in the template search process were exhaustively compared with that of the drugs by using complig 36 complig matches molecular graphs and evaluates the similarity score of two molecules a and b as minma bma ma bmb where ma and mb are the total numbers of atoms and bonds in molecules a and b respectively and ma b is the total number of atoms and bonds matched between molecules a and b both element and chirality if applicable should be identical for atoms and bond order should be identical for bonds to be matched selected drug molecules were built into the protein models by superposing drug molecules to known original ligand molecules with complig according to the graph matching results the dihedral angles in the drug molecules were adjusted toward the corresponding angles in the original ligand molecules and corresponding atoms were superposed between drug and known ligand by fixing the coordinates of the latter the models of proteindrug complexes were further modified with phenix and coot the constraints for drug molecules were generated by using the elbow application in phenix hydrogen bonds were evaluated with canonical parameters constraints were relaxed by 04  and 20 degrees 37 by using chimera 38 the proteinligand complexes were also assessed by using the dsx score function 39 the sarscov2 genome encodes 11 genes open reading frames and the polyprotein from orf1ab is processed into 16 proteins polypeptides through cleavages by the papainlike proteinase and 3clike proteinase activities 1 12 40 as a result of template search the appropriate structural templates were found for 17 sarscov2 proteins among a total of 26 and their homology models were constructed table 1 the 9 unmodeled proteins included those from very short orfs namely nsp11 13 amino acid residues orf7b 43 residues and orf10 38 residues and probable membrane proteins nsp6 orf3a orf6 m and orf8 which were annotated by the sosui server 41 since a considerable amount of structural studies have already been done for sarscov and merscov proteins most of the available templates were from these viruses and they had highsequence similarity more than 90 to sarscov2 proteins two proteins namely papainlike proteinase nsp3 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein could not be modeled into a single structural model as a result of homology search template structures covering the entire protein were unavailable template structures were separated into 6 and 2 fragmentdomain models respectively consequently the coverages of structural model were 56 and 69 of total residues for papainlike proteinase nsp3 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein respectively table 1 the third region of papainlike proteinase nsp3 nsp4 3clike proteinase nsp9 endornase surface glycoprotein envelope protein and cterminal region of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein was modeled into homomultimer as the heteromultimeric models nsp7 and nsp8 were modeled into hetero16mer rnadependent rna polymerase nsp7 and nsp8 were modeled as heterotetramer 112 stoichiometry 3to5 exonuclease and nsp10 formed heterodimer 2oribose methyltransferase and nsp10 also formed heterodimer and homotrimer of surface glycoprotein was modeled in complex with human angiotensin iconverting enzyme 2 ace2 table 1 although the models of sarscov2 protein would be useful for structurebased virtual screening potential drugs for these proteins were sought by rather simple knowledgebased method in the presented study the ligand molecules that were complexed with the homologs of sarscov2 protein in the pdb were extracted and structurally similar molecules to the ligands were sought among the approvedexperimental drugs retrieved from the kegg database 33 and the drugbank database 34 many of the approved drugs such as morphine aspirin or penicillin have been adapted from natural medicines 42 43 the molecules in the natural medicines are expected to serve as argent therapeutics therefore the ligand structures were also compared with the components of natural medicines natural drugs registered in the knapsack database 35 the original ligand molecules and the detected drug molecules are summarized in table 2 a total of 11 ligand molecules were matched to 21 approvedexperimental and 5 natural drugs and the complex models of the sarscov2 proteins with several promising drugs those with high similarity score or placed in higher ranking were constructed as follows 3clike proteinase is involved in the processing of viral polyprotein 44 this enzyme is one of the most extensively studied drug targets and thus analyzed in complex with various peptide mimetic inhibitors 45 46 47 48 unexpectedly these ligands did not show very high similarity to known drug molecules table 2 as a peptide mimetic drug carfilzomib showed highest score to the template ligand ligand code azp of 3clike proteinase homolog fig 1a however the similarity score between the ligand and the drug was only 0754 carfilzomib is the irreversible proteasome inhibitor targeted to the subunits with chymotrypsinlike activity and has been approved for refractory multiple myeloma or waldenstrms macroglobulinemia 49 50 a complex model of carfilzomibsarscov2 3clike proteinase was constructed in the model carfilzomib formed a parallel sheet with his164glu166 and side chains of his41 cys145 met165 leu167 phe185 and gln189 contributed major interactions fig 1bc these residues were conserved between the template sarscov and the model sarscov2 proteins carfilzomib covalently binds to active site threonine through epoxy moiety and the epoxy moiety is also reactive with thiol group of cysteine although a possible covalent linkage between carfilzomib and the catalytic cys145 of sarscov2 3clike proteinase was not explicitly modeled the epoxy moiety was placed close to the catalytic residue in this model the fitness of the ligand to sarscov2 3clike proteinase in the model was evaluated by the dsx function and the score of carfilzomib 1396 was even better than that 998 of inhibitor n3 in the complex crystal structure of sarscov2 3clike proteinase pdb id http6lu7 surface glycoprotein is used for a viral entrance into the host cell and its cell surface receptor is human angiotensin iconverting enzyme 2 ace2 51 ace a homolog of ace2 sharing 44 amino acid sequence identity is a major target of hypertension medicating drugs and several acedrug complexes have been reported 52 53 54 lisinopril enalaprilat and captopril which show similar structures to each other fig 2a have been targeted toward ace and approved for hypertension treatments 55 56 57 58 in the structural complex models these drugs were bound to the protein through a zn2 coordination with glu384 his356 and his360 fig 2bc these residues were conserved between the template ace and the model ace2 structures the drug molecules also formed electrostatic interactions with arg255 and arg500 even though these residues were not conserved between ace and ace2 gln259 and ser504 in ace the sarscov2 surface glycoprotein interacted with ace2 through the receptorbinding domain rbd while the bound drugs had no direct interaction to the rbd fig 2c suggesting that those drugs would not directly interfere the hostpathogen interaction the dsx scores for lisinopril enalaprilat and captopril in the models were 327 436 and 250 respectively these scores were considerably inferior to that 746 of the specific inhibitor mln4760 in the crystal structure of human ace2 complex pdb id http1r4l 59 the complex of 2oribose methyltransferase nsp16 and nsp10 is involved in the modification of the viral rna caps 60 the structure of 2oribose methyltransferase subunit was determined in complex with sadenosyllmethionine ligand code sam 7methylguanosine5triphosphate5guanosine gtg and sinefungin sfg 61 62 63 among these ligands sadenosyllmethionine is used for a therapeutic against depression liver disorders fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis 64 but also is an authentic substrate for this enzyme sinefungin is a natural drug produced by streptomyces griseolus and experimentally used as antibiotics 65 66 67 fig 3a the residues of 2oribose methyltransferase ser74 asp99 asn101 asp130 and met131 were involved in the major interactions with sinefungin fig 3bc these residues were conserved among the template proteins sarscov and betacoronavirus and sarscov2 as the drugs similar to these ligands several investigational adenosine a1 receptor agonists namely tecadenoson selodenoson and trabodenoson were found fig 3a these molecules share adenosine moiety and this moiety interacts with the aforementioned 5 conserved residues in the complex models the dsx scores of sinefungin tecadenoson selodenoson and trabodenoson were 756 543 700 and 553 respectively the scores of sinefungin and selodenoson were comparable to that 749 of the genuine substrate sadenosyllmethionine in the complex crystal structure with merscov 2oribose methyltransferase pdb id http5yni in the presented study knowledgebased models of sarscov2 proteins were constructed by homology modeling and comparison of the known ligands with drugs since a considerable number of structure analyses have already reported for coronavirus proteins including those of sarscov 66 1726 of the sarscov2 proteins could be modeled based on highly similar 85 sequence identity and 89 coverage on average templates table 1 several drugs were suggested to bind to the sarscov2 targets table 2 the procedure employed in the presented study should largely limit the extent of search because it depends on the presence of ligands in known complex structures however it is noteworthy that the binding of suggested drugs to the homologous proteins of the sarscov2 targets would be probable because of the presence of structural evidences the complex models were constructed for several highscored andor highranked drugs unexpectedly no drug was detected for one of the most promising drug targets 3clike proteinase with a similarity score higher than 08 in the previous study the score more than 08 was suggested to be required for highly similar interactions between ligand and protein 36 it is implied that the inhibitors bound to the 3clike proteinase in the known structures are considerably deviated from most of the approved proteasetargeted drugs for example the antihiv drug lopinavirritonavir which was expected to target sarscov2 3clike proteinase 16 17 showed only limited similarity score 0513 to the known ligand ligand code axp of sarscov 3clike proteinase fig 2a one possible reason for the low similarity to drugs is that the protease inhibitors tend to have higher molecular weight and thus their molecular structures showed large variety another reason would be that a majority of the protease inhibitory drugs are targeted toward serine or zinc proteases 68 69 also the expected drug lopinavirritonavir has been designed for hiv protease which is aspartic protease these proteases are structurally distinct from 3clike proteinase known to be a cysteine protease this observation implies that structure optimizations would likely be required for repurposed drugs for sarscov2 3clike proteinase consequently the presented study suggested carfilzomib which has been targeted toward threonine protease and approved for multiple myeloma treatment 49 50 as a marginally resembling drug the model showed however carfilzomib fits well even better than the specific inhibitor n3 according to the dsx score into the active site by forming considerable stabilizing interactions and no severe steric hindrance fig 1c another potential target is the complex of surface glycoprotein and ace2 to prevent virus entry into the cell 70 71 many hypertension drugs are targeted to ace and the presented study highlighted the approved drugs namely lisinopril enalaprilat and captopril as potential ligands for ace2 an expectation in advance was to find a drug that bound to ace2 and also interfered the interactions between surface glycoprotein and ace2 however as the models revealed the drugbinding site of ace2 existed inside a deep cleft in the center of ace2 molecule and the ligands do not interact directly with the surface glycoprotein fig 2c the human ace2 has been demonstrated to change its conformation from open to close forms pdb ids http1r4l and http1r42 respectively upon inhibitor binding 59 thus if this conformational change involves the interface to the rbd of surface glycoprotein a drug bound to the drugbinding site might interfere with the binding between ace2 and surface glycoprotein indirectly this allosteric inhibition mechanism however is not highly expected because no obvious conformational change was observed in the interface region when comparing the open and close conformations of ace2 most of the predicted drugs are targeted toward ace not ace2 and ace and ace2 diverge considerably in their amino acid sequences 44 identity the fitness of the drugs was evaluated to be lower than the specific inhibitor to ace2 therefore effects of the predicted ace drugs on preventing surface glycoproteinace2 interactions would not be highly promising another target presented results highlighted was 2oribose methyltransferase nsp16nsp10 complex which is less focused as a target of drug repurposing 2oribose methyltransferase is required to finalize the cap structure 7megpppa2ome of coronavirus rnas by transferring a methyl group to 2 oh group of ribonucleotide from sadenosyllmethionine 72 73 the cap structure is essential for viral mrnas to be translated and escape from innate immune system in the host cell thus inhibition of this enzyme might prevent virus propagation despite the overall sequence identities between templates sarscov or human betacoronavirus and sarscov2 enzymes were relatively low 66 the residues interacting with the drugs were conserved among the suggested drugs for this enzyme sinefungin is a naturally occurring and verified inhibitor of 2oribose methyltransferase since a toxicity was detected 74 however appreciation of this natural drug should be carefully considered although tecadenoson has been examined in a clinical trial for atrial fibrillation and passed phase ii test final results were not formally reported at this point of time 75 trabodenoson was designed for treating ocular hypertension and primary openangle glaucoma 76 but had failed in the phase iii clinical trial test due to lack of superiority over placebo selodenoson was designed to control heart rate 77 and it seems still in a developmental stage since tecadenoson and trabodenoson appeared to have cleared the phase i tests these drugs would worth examining against covid19 the dsx score suggested the fitness of sinefungin or selodenoson is comparable to the genuine substrate of the 2oribose methyltransferase several structure determinations of sarscov2 proteins for example endornase pdb ids http6vww and http6vw01 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein http6vyo and nsp12 rnadependent rna polymerasensp7nsp8 complex pdb id http7bv2 have been reported after the modeling of the presented study was executed although many of the other proteins should be under analyses undoubtedly it would take considerable time before all structures of potential targets are experimentally elucidated during the period until the structural

 among others when addressing infectious diseases that are not well understood and capable of exhibiting aggressive clinical courses with subsequent patient mortality rapid intervention that is optimally suited to target the pathogen is critical due to the unpredictability and severity of these pathogens combination therapy based on drug repurposing is often indicated due to the urgency of intervention and the requirement of previously established drug safety in humans unfortunately these drug combinations are often designed using trialanderror strategies specifically drugs are selected based on their targets or mechanism of action and they are administered using clinical standard dosing guidelines dose adjustments are made when toxicity is observed unfortunately these approaches likely preclude optimal treatment outcomes previously a broad spectrum of methodologies have been used as part of multiple important studies to develop combination therapies to address multiple disease indications

 of note both of these combinations were based on individual drug doses that were lower than the high doses needed to achieve sufficient efficacy as monotherapies it is important to note that for many of the topranked combinations the component therapies exhibited unfavorable efficacy when delivered as monotherapies but played a key role in mediating optimal efficacy when coadministered as an example for amantadine hcl chloroquine diphosphate and omeprazole sodium monotherapy was shown to be relatively ineffective at high doses compared to no drug treatment amantadine hcl treatment exhibited infection rates of 75 chloroquine diphosphate treatment exhibited infection rates of 25 and omeprazole sodium treatment exhibited infection rates of 50 to further evaluate the importance of drug and dose optimization in systematic combination therapy design it is important to note that optimal combo 1 and suboptimal combo 2 were comprised of the same therapies but at different doses this alone resulted in infection rates of 15 and 107 an approximately sevenfold difference in efficacy and demonstrating the importance of simultaneous drug and dose optimization this is further confirmed by the scenario where replacing amantadine hcl with omeprazole sodium and administering this combination at a suboptimal dose results in a 216 infection rate this represents a 14fold difference in efficacy compared to optimal combo 1 with regards to the factors contributing toward the optimal treatment outcomes analysis of the interaction terms showed that the effects were primarily due to singledrug contributions drug quadratic effects 2drug interaction synergy as well as 3drug interaction synergy figure 4e equation s2s4 supporting information fluorescence microscopy was also used to further evaluate the viral infection rate for optimal drug combinations and the nonoptimal drug combinations figure

 of note no apparent adverse effects cell density for optimal combo 1 and 2 were observed the identification and validation process implemented during project identifai demonstrated that rapid optimization of the combination therapy development roadmap could be completed within 3 days figure

 during the covid19 outbreak immediately deployable combination therapies based on drug repurposing were used in the clinic these included kaletra ritonavirlopinavir in combination with oseltamivir tamiflu and other regimens repurposed monotherapies and combination therapies carry the benefit of previously demonstrated safety in patients and threshold efficacy for other indications therefore it is common in these scenarios to select a small pool of established therapies to coadminister and to adjust drug doses accordingly if toxicity issues ensue while shown to be potentially clinically effective for some patients this is largely a trialanderror strategy globally optimizing drug repurposing is a starkly different approach and can yield combinations comprised of unexpected therapies that far outperform traditional drug combination development which is based on targetmechanismbased drug selection followed by dose finding when not constrained by drug selection based on targets and mechanism of action the pool of candidate therapies can be enlarged to include a broader diversity of compounds for repurposing unfortunately it should also be noted that drug dosing not only impacts single drug efficacy and safety in the context of drug combination design dosing considerations will also impact the drugs that ultimately comprise the best combinations this effectively creates a parameter space that is too large to interrogate using bruteforce testing of all possible combinations project identifai sought to overcome this barrier that is pervasive across the drug development roadmap for virtually all indications and demonstrate that the rapid interrogation of a 12drug parameter space could be completed within a timespan of days in lieu of drug selection followed by dose finding we used a previously established quadratic correlation between the 12drug pool and drug doses input as well as inhibition of a549 infection by vsv and a549 viability outputs to systematically identify the top drug combinations this was achieved independent of any prior knowledge of drug targets mechanismofaction or complex disease biology furthermore the implementation of our platform does not require training based on existing data sets or big data instead a specified set of experiments based on a broad spectrum of drugdose combinations that sufficiently represents the parameter space that is created by the 12drug set is prospectively conducted as such the optimization process is driven completely by prospectively validated data on a cell line or patient sample many efforts to evaluate drug sets for single drug treatment or sampled combinations have been conducted global optimization of combination therapy design from a large drug set opens up the doors to a broader spectrum of actionable regimens as our study has shown even when combinations comprised of the same drugs are administered at varying doses a sevenfold difference in efficacy was observed and even greater differences 14fold were observed when one drug was substituted omeprazole sodium for another amantadine hcl yielding a combination of azithromycinchloroquine diphosphateomeprazole sodiumribavirin under suboptimal dosing conditions this is an interesting finding considering the single drug substitution resulted in such a profound disparity in treatment outcomes even if all of the drugs considered comprised the top 2 optimal combinations this further demonstrated the importance of simultaneous drugdose optimization importantly this process produced multiple drugdoseoptimized combinations within 3 days this approach has the potential of providing a pipeline of alternatives for patients if issues such as drug resistance are encountered it is important to emphasize that this study was conducted using an in vitro vsv model and the top ranked drug combination has not been subsequently clinically validated in addition the vsv model was selected primarily due to it being a wellcharacterized and readily available platform if a different disease platform andor host model are used it is highly probable that the ranking drugs that comprise the combinations and the number of drugs that mediate optimal performance will change also this study was conducted with a diverse range of potential drug candidates in a clinical setting especially to address covid19 or other clinically relevant pathogens the pool of drug candidates which should be developed in consultation with the treating clinical team is likely to differ substantially from the pool used in this study furthermore if this approach is applied toward clinical samples patientspecific rankings of optimal combinations can potentially emerge the importance of the findings of this study are centered on the ability to rapidly interrogate massive parameter spaces that are created when both the right drugs and their right respective doses have to simultaneously reconciled the ability to reconcile this extraordinarily large set of possible combinations in a timely fashion into actionable and globally optimized combinations may be effective for scenarios where the prevention of community spread of novel and aggressive pathogens is critical while additional further clinical validation at the pointofcare is required several key factors pertaining to the broad clinical relevance and prior validation of technologies related to project identifai should be noted firstly previous oncology studies using the quadratic phenotypic optimization platform qpop and curateai which are foundational to project identifai have demonstrated that benchtopbased implementation of this approach have directly led to markedly enhanced patient outcomes compared to traditionally observed results

33
 
34

 additional clinical validation studies including one study that harnessed a related aiguided dosing platform against hiv in humans have further demonstrated the critical importance of drug dosage in mediating optimal treatment efficacy and tolerability

35

 of note doses that are lower than expected as well as dosages that were dynamically modulated were commonly used to optimize patient outcomes deploying aioptimized infectious disease intervention may result in impact beyond technical and clinical innovation to scale these platforms toward broader use healthcare policy economics and infrastructure implications as they apply to the patient payer and system should be considered this platform in many ways simultaneously serves as a diagnostic and intervention because it identifies actionable intervention by calibrating prospectivelyobtained patient or populationbased data added possible benefits include the fact that optimizing drug repurposing to use wellestablished and potentially costeffective therapies to manage unpredictable clinical courses and reductions in treatment complications associated with doselimiting toxicities and lack of efficacy that may be encountered with trialanderrornonoptimized repurposing these outcomes may lead to reduced healthcare cost burden which opens up important discussions on how these platforms can be scaled and efficiently integrated into healthcare workflows to enable better informed healthcare spending decisions by patients

36

 these outcomes may also serve as a foundation for broader clinical deployment of ai to intervene effectively at the earlier stages of an epidemic effective tailoring of treatment to both populations and individuals may also increase healthcare quality and efficiency enabling an opportunity to personalize healthcare costs via qualitybased pricing specifically technologies that realize actionable data on patientspecific drugdose profiles will play a key role in establishing the relationship between individualizing treatment with improved quality of care this relationship will also be driven by the emergence of quality variation as some patients hospital systems and payers will be more willing than others to make available andor pay for the testing that may generate more or better data on patientspecific drugdose profiles in turn this may lead to the introduction of performancebased contracting or qualitybased price discrimination which are suitable pathways to explore especially if they result in better health outcomes while reducing the cost of care

37

 this concept led to a proposed personalized treatment plan for diabetes patients by using the patients doseeffect characteristics they subsequently reported substantial cost reductions and improvements in health outcomes

37

 from the perspective of healthcare providers financial incentives can improve health care quality efficiency and coverage

38

 many countries have implemented a performancebased approach to contracting for medical services which has also led to improvements in domains beyond healthcare quality and efficiency for example this approach in the us is implemented under the name of pay for performance or payment by results in the uk these strategies have shown that performancebased contracting can improve social welfare

39

 an important consideration considering that pandemic mortality rates have been linked to social inequality with higher mortality rates being observed with lower socioeconomic status patients

40

 therefore in the context of global health and addressing epidemics and pandemics the impact of aiguided healthcare will likely expand beyond technical advances and also influence the broader domains of healthcare economics and equality in addition to considering patientcentric healthcare coverage of emerging ai platforms to tailor their treatment as the latest circumstances show on a larger scale global health emergencies can substantially impact economies for example prolonged overburdening of providers patients payers and policymakers due to pandemics coupled with ageing populations can lead to unsustainable healthcare infrastructures when considering the core disease areas that receive the most attention such as cancer diabetes and cardiovascular the reality is that communicable infection remains a formidable healthcare infrastructural burden

41

 for example in many parts of the world there remains a need to develop better infectious disease interventions to fight the overuse of antibiotics positioned to consume 10 million lives annually by 2050

42

 this challenge alone could have dramatic economic consequences considering the regional relevance of this problem 80 of the malaria parasites in parts of thailand and vietnam were resistant to artemisinin and piperaquine and that the failure rates of the among the most potent frontline combination therapy regimens comprised of dihydroartemisininpiperaquine dhappq had reached as high as 87 in northern thailand

43

 many solutions ranging from vaccines to novel drug designs are being proposed to address the covid19 situation however maintaining agility in modulating drug regimens to account for potentially rapid viral mutation or other factors that could dynamically predict patient responses and identify corresponding optimized interventions will be critical dengue which affects more than 400 million people each year is highlydynamic based on variables such as geographical climate a recent study has suggested that 8000 cases of tb could be prevented each year solely through the use of more advanced analytics

44

 the economic evaluation of interventions may become increasingly important as extraordinary circumstances strain healthcare systemwide operations as well as industry operations therefore governments and healthcare systems may be under pressure to substantially impact their qualityadjustedlifeyears qaly and disabilityadjustedlifeyears daly it should also be noted that the compound annual growth rate cagr in global spend on drug research and development was 36 between 2010 and 2017 outpacing global sales of prescription drugs which grew at a cagr of 20 during the same period

45

 further analysis has shown that the same life expectancy in countries could be achieved at 30 of current healthcare expenditures

46

 therefore the importance of accomplishing more while using less resources making healthcare systems more economicallyviable and maximizing the potential of deploying ai into the agile and dynamic deployment of therapeutic regimens cannot be overstated from a global health surveillance perspective merging and reemerging infectious diseases will continue to pose a threat to mankind and it is necessary to develop an arsenal of tools that can be utilized in combatting these pathogens with epidemicpandemic potential based on historical experience the next big outbreak will be something we have not seen before in february 2018 the world health organization who added to the rd blueprint list of priority of diseases disease x

47

 clade x was previously considered a hypothetical variant of an existing family of organisms that evolved to cause human disease a preparedness exercise using this modelled pandemiccausing pathogen demonstrated that a lack of actionable interventions could cause devastating global outcomes

48


 as exhibited with the recent emergence of covid19 there are adequate tools to rapidly identify and obtain genomic details in near real time through modern sequencing techniques that often enable the swift development of effective diagnostics

49

 however the ability to develop medical therapeutics that are both effective and easily deployable remains a critical gap in epidemic response efforts vaccines and therapeutics for the past two outbreaks have benefited from greater than 20 years of development efforts that allowed for rapid advancement to human use clinical studies in epidemic situations interventions that address both individual patient illness and controlprevention of continued transmission are necessary the spectrum of disease caused by emergingreemerging infectious diseases can vary considerably including severe symptomatic disease moderatemild symptomatic disease and asymptomatic spreaders moreover convalescence remains a challenge as recovering patients may continue to shed virus sometimes for extended periods of time after initial infection therefore effective therapeutics and interventions must have the ability to address the full spectrum of disease and contribute to controlling transmission and spread of the pathogen recently efforts around monoclonal antibodies mabs have been proposed as a possible solution

50

 while traditional development times for mabs frame 6 months to years overall costs 100 per gram

51

 and laborious clinical administration intravenous has previously limited their utility in emergency situations especially in austere and resourcelimited clinical settings substantial efforts have been directed to overcome these challenges

52

 this will play a key role in bringing these critically important and potentially highefficacy and highspecificity interventions toward broader use numerous efforts have considered drug repurposing for infectious disease indications as an approach to quickly respond to an outbreak small molecule therapeutics are ideal for rapid deployment in response to an epidemic because they are often stable at room temperature easily available and have known human pharmacokinetic and safety profiles

53


 most successful cases of drug repurposing have been largely serendipitous clinical discoveries however tremendous effort has also been focused on rational drug repurposing through pathogenic phenotypic in silico and in vitro screening efforts how these drugs works are often complex and can be ontarget or offtarget of the original indication ontarget mechanisms of actions moas are often useful targets to block pathogen attachment entry and replication within the host existing viral drugs are usually the first to be applied to novel viral threats an additional benefit with repurposed molecules is their potential offtarget impacts on a pathogen these offtarget effects are usually harder to define during development a major challenge in drug repurposing efforts is that few drugs demonstrate the safety and potency alone to achieve therapeutic antiviral activity therefore studies have focused on combinational strategies to meet the potency and safety dose requirements to be considered in response to a new threat

54

 these efforts rely on in vitro and in vivo testing to evaluate and can be considerably difficult to demonstrate even with two drug combinations

55

 in vitro and especially in vivo testing of single drugs or combinations can be a lengthy process months to years

56

 higher complexity combinational approaches offer the greatest benefit but traditional methods developing higherorder combinations  emerging in silico modelling and ai approaches that are driven by prospective experimental validation are converging to allow for potentially rapid responses to outbreak and pandemic events

7
 
32
 
57

 the approach described here and other recently reported methods are key steps to higher order combinational treatment formulations that overcomes past limitations with repurposing and will allow for disease specific and likely personalized antivirals

58

 the optimized combinations in table 1 were derived and identified from those experimentally tested and thus further studies using the optimized combinations as determined from identifai will be required this work has provided a foundation toward the rapid identification of dynamically optimized and actionable combination therapies to address a broad spectrum of infectious disease applications while also accounting for new strains that may eventually circulate given the mechanism and diseaseagnostic foundation of project identifai further studies will evaluate this platform for rapid covid19 intervention and establish its readiness to pinpoint regimens toward downstream pathogens with aggressive clinical courses pairing the technical capabilities of aidriven drug development platforms with important policybased considerations and lessons learned from the global response to sars h1n1 evd and other epidemicspandemics may ultimately lead to expedited intervention at scale the lung cancer cell line a549 atcc usa was cultured in highglucose dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem invitrogen usa that was supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs invitrogen usa and 1 penicillinstreptomycin invitrogen usa the culture was maintained at 37 c containing 5 vv co2 and the cells were harvested upon reaching 80 confluence 100 l of cell suspension 412k cells per well was seeded in 96well plates and preincubated for 12 h for treatment with the candidate drugs and viral platform cells without any drug treatment and without viral infection served as a control each condition was run in triplicate druginduced cytotoxicity was measured using a cell counting kit8 cck8 dojindo japan briefly 15 l of cck8 solution was added to each well containing 150 l solution and then incubated for 2 h at 37 c in order to conduct the cytotoxicity assay the cell viability was assessed by measuring the absorbance 450 nm via a microplate reader biotek synergy ht usa vesicular stomatitis virus vsv a rna virus was used as the pathogen model in this work vsv was engineered and encoded with green fluorescent protein gfp the concentration of vsv stock was 1  104 pfu l1 and different multiplicity of infection moi parameters were used to optimize the final moi for cell infection the moi used for the optimization process included 1 05 025 0125 01 001 and 0001 and 0 control cells were infected by vsv under different moi parameters for 12 24 and 30 h during the optimization process for each moi the conditions were run in triplicate 100 l of cell suspension 12k cells per well was seeded in a 96 wellplate and preincubated for 12 h to be infected by vsv following viral infection the gfp fluorescence intensity of the cells induced by vsv reproduction was measured with a microplate reader biotek synergy ht usa using the topreading mode with excitation wavelength of 483 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm 12 drugs purchased from selleckchem tx usa were included in this study these included amantadine hcl dexamethasone azithromycin chloroquine diphosphate naproxen sodium fluoxetine hcl loratadine omeprazole sodium ritonavir lopinavir doxycycline and ribavirin amantadine hcl chloroquine diphosphate naproxen sodium fluoxetine hcl omeprazole sodium doxycycline and ribavirin were diluted using complete cell culture medium while dexamethasone azithromycin loratadine ritonavir and lopinavir were diluted in dmso the final stock concentration of all the drugs was 100  103

59

 72 combinations were chosen with the largest sum of multidrug interaction distances and smallest variance of accumulative doses from trillions of randomly generated experiment designs the design of the second stage of validation was generated according to orthogonal array design oad to cancel the disparity of the therapeutic concentration ranges between drugs as well as to facilitate the expression of dose concentrations the concept of equivalent dose was adopted 1 equivalent dose refers to 5  106
m for naproxen sodium and ribavirin and 1  106
m for the others thus the accumulative equivalent dose of a combination therapy was defined as the sum of the equivalent doses of its constituents the parabolic response surface analysis and multidrug interaction regression analysis were conducted via the buildin function stepwiselm in matlab 2018a with selfwritten code the algorithm derived a quadratic model accounting for collinearity using the bidirectional elimination approach with the adjusted rvalue as selection criterion the strict algorithm was used to identify quantitative drug interactions strict is a scoring algorithm based on projection distance which assesses the capacity of infection inhibition by giving an antiviral score to each drug and pairwise interaction in this study

60

 consider a combination kxk1xk2xkn the normalized euclidean distance from point k to the projection p on axis i is
dkisixks2n1where dki is normalized to 01 and mapped with a decreasing function
fdki1dkiq
 the single drug strict score is then defined as the sum of the productions of the outputs projections and the function of the distance which can be denoted as
scoreik1mykxkifdki
 using this definition the strict score can be easily expanded to multidrug interactions if point k is projected to plane ij instead of axis i the normalized distance is
dkisijxks2n2
 thus the drugpair strict score can be defined as

covid-19 semih cantrk aman singh patrick st-amant jason behrmann  the integration of machine learning methods into bioinformatics provides particular benefits in identifying how therapeutics effective in one context might have utility in an unknown clinical context or against a novel pathology we aim to discover the underlying associations between viral proteins and antiviral therapeutics that are effective against them by employing neural network models using the national center for biotechnology information virus protein database and the drugvirus database which provides a comprehensive report of broad-spectrum antiviral agents bsaas and viruses they inhibit we trained ann models with virus protein sequences as inputs and antiviral agents deemed safe-in-humans as outputs model training excluded sars-cov-2 proteins and included only phases ii iii iv and approved level drugs using sequences for sars-cov-2 the coronavirus that causes covid-19 as inputs to the trained models produces outputs of tentative safe-in-human antiviral candidates for treating covid-19 our results suggest multiple drug candidates some of which complement recent findings from noteworthy clinical studies our in-silico approach to drug repurposing has promise in identifying new drug candidates and treatments for other viruses  equal contributions preprint under review  artificial intelligence ai technology is a recent addition to bioinformatics that shows much promise in streamlining the discovery of pharmacologically active compounds 1  machine learning ml provides particular benefits in identifying how drugs effective in one context might have utility in an unknown clinical context or against a novel pathology 2  the application of ml in biomedical research provides new means to conduct exploratory studies and high-throughput analyses using information already available in addition to deriving more value from past research researchers can develop ml tools in relatively short periods of time past research now provides a sizable bank of information concerning drug-biomolecule interactions using drug repurposing as an example we can now train predictive algorithms to identify patterns in how antiviral compounds bind to proteins from diverse virus species we aim to train an ml model so that when presented with the proteome of a novel virus it will suggest antivirals based on the protein segments present in the proteome the final output from the model is a best-fit prediction as to which known antivirals are likely to associate with those familiar protein segments these benefits are of particular interest for the current covid-19 health crisis the novelty of sars-cov-2 requires that we execute health interventions based on past observations grappling with an unforeseen pandemic with no known treatments or vaccines the potential for rapid innovation from ml is of utmost significance the ability to conduct complex analyses with ml enables us to research insights quickly that can help steer us in the right direction for future studies likely to produce fruitful results we present here multiple models that produced a number of antiviral candidates for treating covid-19 out of our 12 top predicted drugs 6 of them have shown positive results in recent findings based on cell culture results and clinical trials these promising antivirals are lopinavir ritonavir ribavirin 3  cyclosporine 4  rapamycin 5  and nitazoxanide 6  for the 7 other predicted drugs further research is needed to evaluate their effectiveness against sars-cov-2  we used two main data sources for this study the first database was the drugvirus database 7  drugvirus provides a database of broad-spectrum antiviral agents bsaas and the associated viruses they inhibit the database covers 83 viruses and 126 compounds and provides information on the status as antiviral of each compound-virus pair these statuses fall into eight categories representing the progressive drug trial phases cell culturesco-cultures primary cells organoids animal model phases i-iv and approved see appendix a for a more intuitive pivot table view of the database the second database is the national center for biotechnology information ncbi virus portal 8  as of april 2020 this database provides approximately 28 million amino-acid and 2 million nucleotide sequences from viruses with humans as hosts each row of this database contains an amino acid sequence specimen from a study as well as metadata that includes the associated virus species in our work we considered sequences only from the 83 virus species in the drugvirus database or their subspecies in order to be able to merge the two data sources successfully we also constrained ourselves to amino-acid sequences only in the current iteration the main reasons for this are two-fold 1 amino-acid sequences are essentially derived from the dna sequences which may encode overlapping information on different levels in somewhat simplified terms amino-acid sequences are the outputs of a layer of preprocessing on genetic material in the form of dnarna 2 nucleotide triplets codons map to amino-acids making amino-acid sequences much shorter and easier to extract features both in preprocessing and in the machine learning methods themselves shorter sequences also mean the ml pipeline will be more resource-efficient ie easier to train the amino-acids were downloaded as three datasets hiv types 1  2 1 192 754 sequences influenza types a b  c 644483 sequences and the main dataset for all other types including sars-cov-2 785624 sequences each dataset came with two components the sequence component is composed on accession ids and the amino-acid sequence itself while the metadata component includes all other data eg virus species date specimen was taken an identifier of the related study as well as the accession id to enable merging the two components the amount of research with a focus on influenza and hiv naturally lead to these viruses comprising most of the samples in our experiments we have excluded these viruses and have worked only with dataset 3 though the other datasets can be integrated into the main one during the class balancing process an idea we will discuss in section 4 future work the first step of the preparation phase was to merge the sequence and metadata components into a single ncbi dataset based on sequence ids afterwards we mapped the species column in this main dataset to the virus name column in the drugvirus database this step was required as these two columns that denote the virus species in the respective datasets did not match due to subspecies present in the sequence dataset and alternative naming of some viruses afterwards we processed the drugvirus dataset to a format suitable for merging with the ncbi data frame every row of the drugvirus dataset consists of a single drug-virus pairing and their respective interactiondrug trial phase meaning any given drug and virus appeared in multiple rows of the dataset we derived a new drugvirus dataset that functioned as a dictionary where each unique virus was a key and the interactions with antivirals encoded as a multi-label binary vector 1 if viable antiviral according to the original dataset 0 if not of length 126 the number of antivirals which corresponded to the value we came up with three versions depending on how we decided an antiviral was a viable candidate to inhibit a virus the criteria depended on drug trial phases 1 in the first version any interaction between a drug-virus pair is designated by a 1 this means drugs that did not go past cell culturesco-cultures or primary cellsorganoids testing are still considered viable candidates 2 this second version expands upon the first stemming from our discovery that an attained trial phase in the database does not necessarily mean previous phases were also listed in the database for example we found that for a given virus a given drug had undergone phase iii testing designated by a 1 but phase i  ii were listed as 0s this undermined our assumption that drug trials are hierarchical though in reality this is usually the case this can be caused by missing data reporting or possibly skipped phases we proceeded with the hierarchy assumption and extended the database in 1 to account for the previous phases this meant that in this second version an approved drug will have all phases designated with 1s for example keeping track of the 8 phases meant that the size of the database also grew by 8 3 in the third version we considered a drug-virus pair as viable only if it has attained phase ii or further drug trials signifying some success with human trials have been observed in the results presented in section 3 our training database was based on this third version of the drugvirus database the full dataset was then generated by merging this new version of the drugvirus dataset with the ncbi dataset we then generated two versions of this full dataset one that consists of all sars-cov-2 sequences and one that consists of all other viruses available this enabled us to compare how successful our models are in a case when they have not been trained on the virus species at all and have to detect peptide substructures in the sequences to suggest antivirals a sample of this final database with some columns excluded for brevity is available in appendix b upon inspection of the data we found that there were replete of duplicate or extremely similar virus sequences to reduce this exploitability and pose a more challenging problem we removed the duplicate sequences that belonged to the same species and had the exact same length this reduced the size of the dataset by approximately 98 the counts for each virus species before and after dropping duplicate viruses is available in appendix c1 and c2 our main database also contained a class imbalance in the number of times certain virus species appeared in the database we oversampled rare viruses eg west nile virus 175 sequences and excluded the very rare species which compose less than 05 of the available unique samples in the dataset eg andes virus 4 sequences and undersampled the common viruses eg hepatitis c 16040 sequences this produced a more modest database of 30479 amino acid sequences with each virus having samples in the 400-900 range see appendix c3 we kept the size of the dataset small both to enable easier model training and validation in early iterations and to handle data imbalance more smoothly the class imbalance problem also presented itself in the antiviral compounds even with balanced virus classes the number of times each drug occurred within the dataset varied simply because some drugs apply to more viruses than others to alleviate this we computed class weights for each drug which we then provided to the models in training this enabled a fairer assessment and a more varied distribution of antivirals in predicted outputs the final step of data processing involved generating the training and validation sets we split the data in two different ways resulting in two different experiments see section 23 experiment setup for the full experiment pipeline experiment i is based on a standard randomized an 80 training20 validation split on the main dataset for experiment ii we split the data on virus species meaning the models were forced to predict drugs for a species that it was not trained on and have to detect peptide substructures in the amino-acid sequences to suggest drugs in this setup we also guaranteed that the sars-cov-2 sequences were always in the test set in addition to three other viruses randomly picked from the dataset we used a variant of this setup that trains on all virus sequences except sars-cov-2 and is validated on sars-cov-2 only to generate the results presented in section 3 a growing number of studies demonstrate the success of using artificial neural networks ann in evaluating biological sequences in drug repositioning and repurposing 9 10  previous work on training neural networks on nucleotide or amino-acid sequences have been successful with recurrent models such as gated recurrent units gru long short-term memory networks lstm and bidirectional lstms bilstm as well as 1d convolutions and 2d convolutional neural networks cnn 11 12  we have therefore focused on these network architectures and conducted our experiments with an lstm with 1d convolutions and bidirectional layers as well as a cnn the network architectures are explained briefly below lstm and 1d convolutions for the lstm a character-level tokenizer was used to encode the fasta sequences into vectors consumable by the network the sequences were then padded with zeros or cut off to a fixed length 500 to maintain a fixed input size the network architecture consisted of an embedding layer followed by 1d convolution and bidirectional lstm layers each followed by maxpooling and two fully connected layers a more detailed architecture diagram is available in appendix d convolutional neural network cnn for the cnn the input features were one-hot encoded based on the fasta alphabetcharset which assisted in interpretability when examining the 2d input arrays as images the inputs are also fixed at a length of 500 resulting in 500 x 28 images where 28 is the number of elements in the fasta charset the network architecture consists of four 2d convolutions with filter sizes of 1x28 2x28 3x28 and 5x28 respectively which are maxpooled concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer a more detailed architecture diagram is available in appendix e the experiments were run on a computer with an 27 ghz intel broadwell cpu 61 gb ram and nvidia k80 gpu 12 gb  both models completed a 20-epoch experiment in 60-90 minutes one to three training and evaluation runs were made for each setup during model and hyperparameter selections and ten training and evaluation runs were done to produce the average metrics in section 3 the experiments start by determining the model to use and apply the appropriate preprocessing steps mentioned in section 22 we then proceed with determining the dataset to train and validate on this part of the experiment setup is more extensively covered in section 214 traintest splitting we used binary cross entropy bce loss adam optimizer precision recall and f1-score as metrics since accuracy tends to be an unreliable metric given the class imbalance and the sparse nature of our outputs after training and validation predictions were done on the validation set and the results were post-processed for interpretability in post-processing we applied a threshold to the sigmoid function outputs of the neural network where we assigned each drug a probability of being a potential antiviral for a given amino acid sequence after experimenting with different values we settled on a threshold value of 02 postprocessing outputs a list of drugs that were selected along with the respective probabilities for the drugs being effective against the virus with the given amino acid sequence for other hyperparameters involved as well as information on hyperparameter tuning see appendix f here we present the results for the two experiments described in section 214 traintest splitting the figures and tables presented in this section are based on the lstm and cnn architectures described in section 22 which were trained on 128 batch size and 001 and 0001 learning rates respectively for 20 epochs with an adam optimizer in the regular setup we performed an 8020 train-test split on our data of 30479 sequences the metrics for the best set of hyperparameters based on validation set f1-score for both the cnn and lstm architectures respectively are presented in table 1  similarly plots for the same set of models and hyperparameters over 20 epochs are presented in figures 1 and 2  our models handled the task successfully achieving 0958 f1-score in a multi-label multi-class problem setting this means that the models were able to match the virus species with the sequence substructures and appropriately assign the inhibiting antivirals with accuracy these satisfactory results led to us implementing experiment ii in experiment ii the models predicted antiviral drugs for virus species they havent been trained on this meant the models were not able to recommend drugs by recognizing the virus from the sequence and therefore had to rely only on peptide substructures in the sequences to assign drugs in the results presented below the test set consists of sars-cov-2 herpes simplex virus 1 human astrovirus and ebola virus whose sequences were removed from the training set we see here that the cnn and the lstm had issues with convergence and the accuracies are clearly below their counterparts in the regular setup though this is certainly expected we now turn to the actual predictions on the sequences and attempt to interpret them upon examination of drug predictions for herpes simplex virus 1 hsv-1 however we see that our cnn was in fact quite successful in table 3 and table 4  count represents how many times each drug was flagged as potentially effective for hsv-1 sequences and mean probability denotes the average confidence predicted over all instances of the drug a sample of the outputs where these metrics are derived from is available in appendix g antivirals used for phase ii and further trials for hsv-1 are highlighted in bold meaning all six drugs in the database that are used for phase ii and further trials are predicted by our model three of the top five predictions are approved antivirals for hsv-1 and the only remaining one is predicted 11th among 126 antivirals this high level of accuracy is remarkable given that our model has not been trained on hsv-1 sequences predictions for sars-cov-2 with some variation between the two both the lstm table 4a  and the cnn table 4b seem to converge on a number of drugs ritonavir lopinavir both phase iii for mers-cov tilorone approved for mers-cov and brincidofovir are in the top five candidates in both while valacyclovir ganciclovir rapamycin and cidofovir rank high up in both lists most of the remaining drugs are present in both lists as well the lstm is more conservative in its predictions than the cnn and the overall counts for sars-cov-2 are significantly lower than for herpes simplex virus 1 for both pointing a comparable lack of confidence on the models part in predicting sars-cov-2 sequences a further step we took for the sars-cov-2 sequences was visualizing the layer activations in the zetane engine to validate that the model was processing the data at a fine-grained level this was done in similar fashion to a study where integrated gradients were used to generate attributions on a neural network performing molecule classification 13  the layer activations in both models showed that different antivirals activated different subsequences of a given sequence at the amino acid level thus validating our approach the filter activations are available in appendix h the preliminary results of our experiments show promise and merit further investigation we note that our ml models predict that some antivirals that show promise as treatments against mers-cov may also be effective against sars-cov-2 these include the broad-spectrum antiviral tilorone 14 and the drug lopinavir 15  the latter of which is now in phase iv clinical trials to determine its efficacy against covid-19 16  such observations suggest with confidence that our models can recognize reliable patterns between particular antivirals and species of viruses containing homologous amino acid sequences in their proteome additional observations that support our findings have come to light from a study in the lancet published shortly before this article 3  this open-label randomized phase ii trial observed that the combined administration of the drugs interferon beta-1b lopinavir ritonavir and ribavirin provides an effective treatment of covid-19 in patients with mild to moderate symptoms both of our models flagged three of the drugs in that trial note that interferon was not part of our datasets in terms of number of occurrences aka count ritonavir lopinavir and ribavirin were ranked 4th 5th and 11th by the lstm while the cnn model ranked them 3rd 4th and 10th respectively other studies have also focused on the treatment of sars-cov-2 by drugs predicted in our experiments wang et al discovered that nitazoxanide lstm rank 10th cnn rank 8th inhibited sars-cov-2 at a low-micromolar concentration 6  gordon 12th is known to be effective against diverse coronaviruses 4  such observations are encouraging they demonstrate that predictive models may have value in identifying potential therapeutics that merit priority for advanced clinical trials they also add to growing observations that support using ml to streamline drug discovery from that perspective our models suggest that the broad spectrum antiviral tilorone for instance may be a top candidate for covid-19 clinical trials in the near future other candidates highlighted by our results and may merit further studies are brincidofovir foscarnet artesunate cidofovir valacyclovir and ganciclovir the antivirals identified here have some discrepancies with emerging research findings as well for instance our models did not highlight the widely available anti-parasitic ivermectin one research study observed that ivermectin could inhibit the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro 17  another large-scale drug repositioning survey screened a library of nearly 12000 drugs and identified six candidate antivirals for sars-cov-2 pikfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod cysteine protease inhibitors mdl-28170 z lvg chn2 vby-825 and ono 5334 and the ccr1 antagonist mln-3897 18  it comes as no surprise that our models did not identify these compounds as our data sources did not contain them future efforts to strengthen our ml models will thus require us to integrate a growing bank of novel data from emerging research findings into our ml pipeline in terms of our machine learning models better feature extraction can improve predictions drastically this step involves improvements through better data engineering and working with domain experts who are familiar with applied bioinformatics to better understand the nature of our data and find ways to improve our data processing pipeline some proposals for future work that could strengthen the performance of our machine learning process are as follows 1 deeper interaction with domain experts and further lab testing would lead to a better understanding of the antivirals and the amino-acid sequences they target leading to building better ml pipelines for drug repurposing 2 better handling of duplicates can improve the quality of data available the current approach which is based on species and sequence length can be improved through using string similarity measures such as dice coefficient cosine similarity levenshtein distance etc 3 influenza and hiv datasets should be integrated into the data generation and processing pipeline to enhance available data 4 vectorizers can be used to extract features as n-grams small sequences of chars which has attained success in similar problems 19  other unsupervised learning methods such as singular value decomposition also may be applicable to our study 20  we hope that the machine learning approaches and pipelines developed here may provide longterm benefit to public health the fact that our results show much promise in streamlining drug discovery for sars-cov-2 motivates us to adapt our current models so we can conduct identical drug repurposing assessments for other known viruses moreover experimental data suggests that our approaches are generalizable to other viruses see the hsv-1 example in section 32 experiment ii -we are therefore confident that we could adapt our models to conduct equivalent studies during the next outbreak of a novel virus this also means our methods can be used to repurpose existing drugs in order to find more potent treatments for known viruses the direct beneficiaries of our findings are members of the clinical research community using relatively few resources ml-guided drug repurposing technology can help prioritize clinical investigations and streamline drug discovery in addition to reducing costs and expediting clinical innovation such efficiency gains may reduce the number of clinical trials -and thus human subjects used in risky research -needed to find effective treatments this pertains to the ethical imperative to avoid harm when possible also of importance is that in-silico analyses using machine learning provide yet another means to employ past research findings in new investigations ml-guided drug repurposing thus provides means to obtain further value from knowledge on-hand maximizing value in this case is laudable on many fronts especially in terms of providing maximum benefit from publicly-funded research the negative consequences that could arise should our models fail appear limited but are noteworthy nonetheless note that our models aim to only indicate possible therapeutics that merit further clinical investigation in order to prove any antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 should our models fail by recommending spurious treatments these incorrect predictions may divert limited time and resources towards frivolous investigations it should also be noted that our methods aim to primarily work as guidance for medical experts and not as a be-all-end-all solution and any incorrect inferences made by our models are bound to be detected early by medical experts communicating any machine-learning predictions of tentative antiviral drugs from this study requires much caution the current pandemic continues to demonstrate how fear misinformation and a lack of knowledge about a novel communicable disease can encourage counterproductive health-seeking behaviour amongst the public soon after the coronavirus became a widely understood threat the internet was awash in false -sometimes downright harmful -information about preventing and treating covid-19 included within this misleading health information were premature claims by some prominent government officials that therapeutics like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might hold promise as a repurposed drug for covid-19 such unfounded advice caused avoidable poisonings from people self-medicating with chloroquine subsequent clinical investigations demonstrated no notable benefit and potential adverse reactions to chloroquine when used to treat covid-19 such unfortunate events remind us that preliminary findings may be misinterpreted as conclusive treatments or as evidence to support inconclusive health claims the hyperparameters tested in our experiments are presented in section f it is certainly possible to improve the accuracies of our experiments by conducting a vaster coverage of the loss landscape through more extensive training eg running longer experiments with smaller learning rates on more complex network architectures especially for results in experiment ii however due to performance constraints the scope of hyperparameter tuning as well as the ann architectures experimented on are relatively constrained as we focused on the methodology as opposed to optimal performance in this study it should be noted that much improvement is possible in this front as pointed out in discussion and future work additional notes regarding our observations during hyperparameter tuning are presented below  for the threshold we wanted to predict eagerly ie we considered false negatives more costly errors than false positives a high threshold would mean the outputs would be composed only of the antivirals our models are very confident about per amino acid sequence this we deem undesirable as while we do hope these outputs narrow the scope of antivirals to focus on over-restricting could prevent antivirals that are predicted frequently yet with low probability be detected a low threshold such as 02 filtered the number of antivirals sufficiently but also left enough breathing room for the domain experts to draw their own conclusions on a per-drug basis  while a larger sequence length cutoff was possible and not detrimental to the results we deemed 500 a suitable trade-off in terms of performance versus accuracy as many sequences do not reach lengths in the thousands to begin with  as mentioned the number of epochs trained could be increased as we did not see dramatic signs of overfitting at 20 epochs or further however a flattening of the metrics were evident around 20 epochs with the hyperparameters listed which therefore was selected a suitable stopping point table 10  a section of sample outputs for amino acid sequences and their associated

novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 necessitates strategies to identify prophylactic and therapeutic drug candidates for rapid clinical deployment a high-throughput high-content imaging assay of human hela cells expressing the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 was used to screen reframe a best-in-class drug repurposing library from nearly 12000 compounds we identified 66 compounds capable of selectively inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication in human cells twenty-four of these drugs show additive activity in combination with the rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and may afford increased in vivo efficacy we also identified synergistic interaction of the nucleoside analog riboprine and a folate antagonist 10deazaaminopterin with remdesivir overall seven clinically approved drugs halofantrine amiodarone nelfinavir simeprevir manidipine ozanimod osimertinib and 19 compounds in other stages of development may have the potential to be repurposed as sars-cov-2 oral therapeutics based on their potency pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles  patients with sars-cov-1 and mers-cov remain unvalidated for the newly emerged sars-cov-2 3  remdesivir a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity that works as an rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor has been reported to be effective against mers-cov and sars-cov-1 infections in animal models 4 5 6  repositioning of remdesivir as a treatment against sars-cov-2 infection has recently demonstrated positive clinical endpoints in a phase 3 adaptive covid-19 treatment trial median time to recovery shortened from 15 to 11 days 7 that justified emergency use authorization of remdesivir by the us food  drug administration for treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients 8  the effectiveness of the repurposed drug remdesivir with the current formulation requiring administration by iv infusion both highlights the importance of investigating pre-existing drugs to combat sars-cov-2 infections and the need for discovery of new or supplemental therapies that result in greater clinical improvements and can be administered outside of a hospital setting ie orally the reframe repurposing focused rescue and accelerated medchem drug collection is an extensive drug repurposing library containing nearly 12000 small-molecule drugs shown to be appropriate for direct use in humans 9 and provides a rich resource to discover new treatments that may be used as additional monotherapies or even in combination with remdesivir to further enhance efficacy and reduce drug resistance potential to identify compounds that could inhibit entry or replication of sars-cov-2 in human cells we developed a high-content imaging hci 384-well format assay using hela cells expressing the human sars-cov-2 receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ace2 hela-ace2 in this assay hela-ace2 cells are infected with sars-cov-2 virus in the presence of compounds of interest and viral infection is quantified 24 hours later fig 1a  the assay relies on immunofluorescent detection of sars-cov-2 proteins with sera purified from patients exposed to the virus which together with host cell nuclear staining allows for quantification of the percent infected cells in each well fig 1b  we validated the assay using compounds with reported activity against ebola and suspected or previously verified activity against sars-cov-2 remdesivir gs-5734 10 ec 50  194  20 nm average  sem of 5 independent experiments and the pikfyve inhibitor apilimod ec 50  50  11 nm average  sem of 4 independent experiments fig 1b  remdesivir at elevated concentrations was able to eliminate infected cells almost completely fig 1c  and we used it at a concentration of 25 m as a positive control with data normalized to it and neutral dmso control wells while apilimod was more potent than remdesivir it had a fractionally lower maximal efficacy 85-90 of uninfected cells at the highest effective concentrations compared to remdesivir additionally we assessed compound toxicity in the context of infection by quantifying the total cell numbers per well with cytotoxic protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin as a positive control average ec 50  547  27 nm average  sem of 5 independent experiments hela-ace2 cc 50  245  023 m average  sem of 5 independent experiments notably a concomitant increase in cell numbers coincided with the antiviral activity of remdesivir and apilimod likely due to reduction in proliferation of infected cells fig 1b-e  altering the multiplicity of infection had modest effects on the potency of control compounds in the same experiment with a 27-fold increase in remdesivirs ec 50 from moi1 to moi26 and a 37-fold increase in apilimods ec 50  but not that of puromycin fig s1  using the developed assay we ran a pilot screen to assess the activity of 148 small molecules with suspected therapeutic potential against coronavirus infections mined from the available literature 11 rz  084 we identified 19 compounds with an ec 50  96 m and based on data obtained from an uninfected hela-ace2 24-hour livedead assay 10 of these were selective uninfected hela-ace2 cc 50 sars-cov-2 ec 50  10 or uninfected hela-ace2 cc 50  40 m table s1  this included libraryscreening lots of apilimod ec 50  184 nm cc 50  40 m and remdesivir ec 50  300 nm cc 50  40 m that were rediscovered in the assay the higher ec 50 of apilimod and remdesivir are likely due to slight degradation over time in the screening deck compared to freshly prepared control powder stock screening reframe a best-in-class drug repurposing library next we screened the 12000-compound reframe repurposing library at a final concentration of 19 m and 96 m assay quality was maintained throughout both screens rz of 087 and 072 respectively table 1  and a clear distinction was apparent in the activity profiles of dmso vehicle-neutral control remdesivir-positive control apilimod- and puromycin-toxicity control-treated wells fig 1d 1e  hits were selected based on demonstration of 50 reduction in the number of infected cells per well -50 activity normalized to neutral controls minus inhibitors and 40 toxicity based on the total cell number per well -40 activity normalized to compound activities including 10 m puromycin fig 1e 1f  identifying 61 primary hits at 19 m and 266 primary hits at 96 m screening concentrations hit rates of 051 and 224 respectively with a total of 311 hits the hit rate for the primary screen of the reframe library was high 275 but not unexpected for this collection of bioactive small molecules many of which are approved drugs or in clinical phases of development and used for a wide assortment of indications  fig 2a  to reconfirm and assess potency and selectivity of the primary hits we tested 310 of the available compounds in a 10point 13 dilution dose response format with a top concentration of 96 m of these 225 726 demonstrated activity with ec 50  96 m against sars-cov-2 however many of the primary screen hits were also cytotoxic with an unacceptably low selectivity ratio as determined in uninfected hela-ace2 cells uninfected cc 50 ec 50  10  table 2  fig 2b  because viruses rely on host machinery for replication it was not unexpected that many of the compounds with antiviral activity also affected vital host processes interestingly this toxicity was sometimes masked in infected cells as reduction of viral infection by compounds like the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin and even hydroxychloroquine provided a benefit to cell health in the context of infection but not in uninfected cells fig 2c  table  s1  between the small pilot and the reframe screen and not including remdesivir we identified 67 66 unique as two different lots of gw-803430 were identified potent ec 50  96 m and selective cc 50 ec 50 10 or cc 50  398 m compounds  fig 2b  d table s1  the top four classes of potent and selective compounds were oncolytic compounds ion channel modulators anti-psychotics and receptor binding compounds fig 2d  a fifth of potent and selective hits could be classified as oncolytic drugs further reflecting the reliance of the virus on host cell processes present in rapidly proliferating cells the identification of compounds belonging to anti-psychotic cardiovascular and even anti-parasitic neglected tropical diseases classes may reflect the cationic amphiphilic nature of some of these molecules and their ability to accumulate in and impact acidic intracellular compartments eg late endosomeslysosomes resultant dysregulation of the endo-lysosomal pathway and lipid homeostasis has been suggested to impair viral entry andor replication 12 and this mode of action has been speculated for amiodarone and hydroxychloroquine both identified here as potent and selective hits against sars-cov-2 in our screen  table 2 table s1  we also identified two selective estrogen receptor modulators bazedoxifene ec 50  347 m and raloxifene ec 50  413 m a class of compounds previously found to inhibit ebola virus infection 13  out of the identified hits of highest interest were the newly identified approved oral drugs halofantrine hcl amiodarone nelfinavir mesylate simperevir manidipine ozanimod andosimertinib due to their relatively high exposures or a long history of use as therapeutic agents and therefore potential to be quickly repurposed as covid-19 treatments following further efficacy vetting in animal models the viral protease inhibitors nelfinavir and simeprevir have good exposures and based on their described mode of action we speculate that they inhibit sars-cov-2 directly the selective sphingosine-1-phosphate s1p1 receptor modulator ozanimod is also intriguing as a potential covid-19 therapy selective s1p1 agonists have been shown to provide significant protection against influenza virus infection in murine models by reducing inflammation at the site of infection reducing release of cytokines by pulmonary endothelial cells and infiltration of lymphocytes into the lungs 14  and thus ozanimod may serve as a good combination partner for a direct-acting antiviral drug the approved calcium-channel blocker manidipine has low exposure but may have the potential to improve covid-19 disease outcomes for patients interestingly amiodarone has previously been identified as having broad-spectrum antiviral activity in an in vitro screen 15  nineteen other compounds in various stages of development such as apilimod assay control that may inhibit viral entry through disruption of endolysosomal trafficking as found for filoviruses 16  the protease inhibitors nco 700 cathepsin b and dutacatib cathepsin k which may also impact viral entry all have the potential to show efficacy due to their potency or pharmacokinetic profiles  table 2  most of these except for the very potent apilimod had modest ec 50 s  1 m that did not surpass the potency of remdesivir however remdesivirs requirement for intravenous administration and potentially limited efficacy warrants further investigation into alternative or supplemental therapies therefore we investigated whether the hits identified in our screen would be suitable as partners for a combination therapy with remdesivir combination therapies have the potential to increase efficacy of treatment while reducing drug dose of either or both combinations partners and thus prevent side effects that may be associated with administration of higher doses drug combinations can also slow the acquisition of drug resistance drug synergy the increase in activity of the combination therapy beyond what is expected of an additive interaction is rare yet additive effects themselves have the potential to improve therapy regimens conversely antagonism the inhibition of activity of the overall combination beyond what would be expected if the compounds acted independently is an undesirable property to identify synergistic additive and antagonistic interactions between remdesivir and reframe hits we performed synergy interactions studies in a checkerboard experiment comparing full dose response of remdesivir against the dose responses of 24 hits with attractive safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in a 10  10 matrix fig 2e  we used the synergyfinder package 17 in r to assess the interactions between the tested compounds using the zero interaction potency model zip 18  where a  score  10 indicates likely synergy   -10 indicates antagonism and  between -10 and 10 suggests an additive interaction we found no genuine synergy between remdesivir and the compounds tested however the combinations were additive including that of nelfinavir with remdesivir fig 3a  table 1 table s1  suggesting these drugs if they were to prove efficacious in vivo could potentially be co-administered with remdesivir to increase the overall safety and efficacy of treatment while limiting the evolution of drug resistance to identify compounds that interact synergistically with remdesivir we carried out a second unbiased reframe screen in the presence of low concentrations 80 nm of remdesivir the activity of novel hits from this screen were assessed in the presence and absence of remdesivir based on a perceived shift in activity in the presence of remdesivir compounds were tested in a checkerboard synergy matrix and we identified the nucleoside analog riboprine n6-isopentenyladenosine previously investigated as an antineoplastic agent for treatment of nausea and surgical site infections and a component of citranatal 90 dha a prescription prenatalpostnatal multivitaminmineral tablet and a folate antagonist 10-deazaaminopterin an antineoplastic compound currently in phase ii stage of development as having activities that synergized with those of remdesivir the synergistic effects for both compounds were observed across specific concentrations signified as peaks within the 3dimensional synergy score landscape  figure 3b 3c  prompting closer scrutiny of activity of each compound riboprine achieved maximal 100 efficacy over the range of concentrations tested but addition of ec 2 of remdesivir shifted its ec 50 from 12 m to 36 m and addition of ec 24 of remdesivir increased its potency further to ec 50  16 m  figure 3b  10-deazaaminopterin showed only 40 maximal efficacy over the range of concentrations tested but the addition of ec 2 of remdesivir caused an increase of maximal efficacy from 40 to nearly 65 where a shift of 2 would be expected and addition of ec 24 of remdesivir increased maximal efficacy of the combination from 40 to 80  figure 3c  the mechanism of action behind the observed synergies remains to be determined riboprine has been reported to block uridine and cytidine import 19 and through inhibition of protein prenylation to inhibit autophagy 20 which could impact rna catabolism 21 whereas 10-deazaaminopterin has been suggested to inhibit folate dependent enzymes of the purine biosynthesis pathway 19 20 21 22  therefore treatment with either riboprine or 10-deazaminopterin may result in reduced intracellular nucleoside pools and in this way synergize with rdrp inhibition by the adenosine nucleoside analog remdesivir however another or more direct and specific interaction cannot be excluded and remains to be elucidated while these findings indicate a promising avenue for further investigation of combination therapies for treatment of covid-19 the adverse effects of these agents eg inhibition of immunity by 10-deazaaminopterin would need to be carefully considered in the design and dose selection of in vivo validation experiments in summary by screening the high-value repurposing reframe library we identified 75 unique known drugs or preclinical molecules with activity against sars-cov-2 in human cells 24 of which were tested and showed an additive interaction in combination with the antiviral compound remdesivir recently granted emergency approval for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection we also identified a synergistic interaction between remdesivir and both 10-deazaaminopterin and riboprine our data support the advancement of the identified compounds for further profiling in in vivo models to assess their utility alone or in combination with remdesivir

classification of 66 potent and selective compounds according to their functional annotation   repurposing didanosine as a potential treatment for covid-19 using single-cell rna sequencing data fadhl alakwaa m jack gilbert a   as of today 7 april 2020 more than 81000 people around the world have died from the coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 pandemic there is no approved drug or vaccine for covid-19 although more than 10 clinical trials have been launched to test potential drugs these potential drugs have included drugs based on their promising effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or middle east respiratory syndrome mers or on their ability to block host target proteins such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which may be a sars receptor 1 bioinformaticians and data scientists can help by identifying potential candidates from available big data to narrow the scope of research and accelerate discovery focusing efforts on repurposing drugs already approved for other applications and with known safety profiles saves on cost shortens the time to approval and accelerates the bench-to-bedside time bringing aid to covid-19 patients sooner in an urgent response to this pandemic i developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify compounds and drug candidates to potentially treat covid-19 the results from this pipeline are still preliminary and have not been validated in vitro this pipeline is based on publicly available single-cell rna sequencing scrna-seq data 2 and the drug perturbation database library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs 3 the scrna-seq data contains samples from eight healthy human lung transplant donors and eight samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis gene expression omnibus repository accession no gse122960 2 analyzing this scrna-seq data reveals that ace2 is mainly expressed in type ii alveolar cells at2 cells i first identified significantly differentiated genes degs adjusted p value of 005 between at2 cells that express ace2 and at2 cells that do not express ace2 i found 30 upregulated degs including slc1a5 cxadr cav2 nup98 ctbp2 gsn hspa1b stom and rab1b downregulating these genes will be very important in a treatment approach because they regulate viral reproduction and transmission 4 next i used the connectivity map linked user environment clue platform which connects to the lincs database of small-molecule perturbations on gene expression to identify drugs and compounds that can reverse these upregulated genes 3 clue selected 39 out of 2837 drugs with a negative connectivity score cs of less than 90 the closer the cs is to 100 the greater the chance the drug has of reversing upregulated degs in this instance drugs that can reverse expression of degs upregulated in ace2-expressing at2 cells the complete drug list can be downloaded from httpsgithubcomfadhlyemencovid-19 none of these drugs have been validated third i developed a ranking score system that prioritizes these drugs or small molecules based on three developed scores the cs from clue s1 the genetic perturbation score s2 and the class score s3 the definitions and equations of these scores can be found at httpsgithubcomfadhlyemencovid-19 the four drugs with the highest total score st are didanosine benzyl-quinazolin-4-yl-amine camptothecin and ro-90-7501 table 1 didanosine is an hiv antiviral drug that belongs to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class 5 all the drugs belonging to this class have negative scores s3 in addition the cs of knocking down purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnp the target gene of didanosine is also negative s2 didanosine is a prescription drug approved by the us food and drug administration fda for treating hiv infection the second benzyl-quinazolin-4-yl-amine is a compound that belongs to the family of epidermal growth factor receptor egfr inhibitors interestingly knocking down egfr also produced a negative score the third molecule on our list is camptothecin a topoisomerase inhibitor and alkaloid present in camptotheca acuminata which is used in traditional chinese medicine knocking down camptothecins target gene also generates negative scores such as to top1 52 and tif1a 92 sixteen out of 17 93 drugs belonging to the class of topoisomerase inhibitors have negative scores s3 the last drug ro-90-7501 targets the amyloid precursor protein app gene and is an amyloid-42 aggregation inhibitor and candidate alzheimers disease molecule 6 in conclusion i have demonstrated the utility of bioinformatics for identifying drugs that can be repurposed for potentially treating covid-19 patients the drugs listed are preliminary and need in vitro validation i also call for such approaches on covd-19 targets other than ace2 to nominate additional candidates for in vitro and in vivo testing which could accelerate drug discovery for covid-19  repurposing of miglustat to inhibit the coronavirus severe acquired respiratory 1 syndrome sars-cov-2 2 3 sreejith rajasekharan   rafaela bonotto milan yvette kazungu lais nascimento  alves monica poggianella pamela orellana martinez natasa skoko sulena polez alessandro marcello   the novel severe acquired respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 coronavirus the 2 etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019  has now spread in everywhere 3 causing a global pandemic 1 2 to date there have been more than 35 million reported 4 cases and 250000 deaths worldwide urging for a global effort to tackle the disease 3 5 sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the orderfamilysub-family 6 nidoviralescoronaviridaecoronavirinae the virion is enveloped and contains a single 7 rna genome of positive polarity morphologically sars-cov-2 is about 120 nm in 8 diameter with large projections of the heavily glycosylated trimeric spike s proteins 9 other surface proteins include the membrane m and envelope e proteins while inside 10 the envelope the helical nucleocapsid n wraps the viral rna the virus targets cells of 11 the upper and lower respiratory tract epithelia through the viral spike that binds to the 12 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor a process facilitated by the host type 2 13 transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 once inside the cell viral polyproteins are 14 synthesized that encode for the replication machinery required to synthesize new rna via 15 its rna-dependent rna polymerase activity replication is cytoplasmatic at the level of 16 the endoplasmic reticulum er that is heavily rearranged structural proteins are then 17 synthesized leading to completion of assembly and release of viral particles 4 5  18 currently no specific treatment against sars-cov-2 is available and the only antiviral 19 therapy comes from repurposing of drugs developed for other viral infections lopinavir 20 and ritonavir remdesivir hydroxychloroquine umifenovir and favipiravir are examples 21 that are currently being evaluated but none have been conclusively shown to be effective 22 6  23 the iminosugar miglustat zavesca n-butyl-1-deoxynojirimycin nb-dnj inhibits -24 glucosidases i and ii that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein n-linked 25 oligosaccharide processing in the er 7 because most enveloped viruses require 26 glycosylation for surface protein folding and secretion modulation of the oligosaccharide 27 to induce a reduction in infectivity became a strategy for treatment of the immune 28 deficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 culminating in phase iii clinical trials 8 9  the use of 29 iminosugars to misfold viral glycoprotein as a therapeutic approach has so far been 30 applied to several other viral infections including hepatitis b and c viruses dengue and 31 other flaviviruses and ebola virus 10-12 an additional property of certain iminosugars is 32 the glucosyltransferase inhibition activity which is the basis for current therapy of rare 33 genetic lysosome storage diseases such as gaucher and niemann-pick type c 13 this 34 activity of miglustat could impact virus entry by modification of the plasma membrane 35 vero e6 cells atcc-1586 hek 293t atcc crl-3216 a549 atcc ccl-185

cyototoxicity until 1 9 mm cc 50  1 mm the plaque assay was performed in vero e6 cells which are standard 10 for the growth of sars-cov-2 however further analysis would be better performed in 11 cells of human origin to better characterize this hypothesis a time-of-addition toa experiment was 1 performed different conditions were used pre-treatment co-treatment and post-2 treatment huh7 cells were pre-treated with 200 m miglustat for 3h and then infected for 3 1h in the absence of drug moi  01 afterwards the virus was removed and the cells 4 were cultured in drug-free medium until the end of the experiment for co-treatment the 5 drug was added together with the virus during infection and then cells were maintained in 6 drug-free medium for post-entry experiment drug was added at 3 h post-infection and 7 maintained until the end of the experiment as shown in figure 2a  drug didnt affect viral 8 entry neither was virucidal when administered concomitant with infection replication 9 intracellular viral rna was slightly affected at 48hpi and significantly at 72hpi consistent 10 with the idea that miglustat was effective at the post-entry level this was reflected by the 11 reduction of intracellular nucleocapsid n protein observed at both time points  figure 2b  detected by the conformation-dependent msip-3022 antibody as shown in figure 2j and 29 2k miglustat reduce the amount of protein on the cell surface host directed antiviral therapy is a strategy of inhibiting virus infection by targeting host 2 factors that are essential for viral replication 23 currently there is a pressing need for 3 antiviral drugs for immediate use in the context of sars-cov-2 infection miglustat is a 4 drug that is in current clinical use for the treatment of certain genetic disorders and has 5 shown to be active against a variety of viral infections making it a suitable candidate for 6 drug repurposing towards sars-cov-2 in this work the activity of miglustat against 7 sars-cov-2 has been demonstrated in vitro with ec 50 in the micromolar range the 8 standard dosage for lysosomal storage diseases such as gaucher or niemann pick is 100 9 mg3 times a day with a maximum daily dose of 600 mgday a single dose of 100 mg 10 miglustat reaches a peak in plasma concentration of around 3-5 m within 4 hours while 11 half-life is approximately 8 hours if this dose is administered every 4 hours6 times per 12 day the plasma concentration of miglustat would stabilize around 10 m 24 if 200 mg 13 miglustat is administered every 8 hours3 times a day the plasma concentration could be 14 also higher than 10 m in 24 hours however increased dosage could lead to well-15 described adverse reactions that include tremors diarrhea numbness and 16 miglustat has been shown to act through two different mechanisms at the level of virus 18 entry by perturbing the plasma membrane and at the level of folding and secretion of 19 virion proteins by affecting essential glycosylation steps in the er the latter mechanism 20 is supported by the data presented in this work where a strong antiviral activity is detected 21 only when the drug is added post-infection correct folding and secretion of glycoproteins 22 is a process tightly controlled in the er by chaperons such as calnexin that recognize 23 specific glycosylation intermediates 25 miglustat interferes with this process resulting in 24 the accumulation of misfolded proteins and a defect in secretion consistently the spike 25 protein of sars-cov-1 has been shown to bind calnexin and disruption of this function 26 caused decrease of virus infectivity 22 27 in conclusion this work provides in vitro evidence for the use of miglustat as inhibitor of 28 sars-cov-2 and proposes its use in clinical trials for covid-19 patients monolayers infected with sars-cov-2 following incubation for three days cells were 5 fixed and stained to count viral plaques against vehicle control which were plotted as 6 percent inhibitory activity black dots cytotoxicity was measured by the alamar blue 7 method and data plotted as percent viability red squares   repurposing disulfiram as an anti-obesity drug treating and preventing obesity in high-fat-fed rats ziad omran ryan sheikh othman baothman a mazin zamzami a mohamed alarjah   the pandemic of obesity is growing at a worrying pace with an estimated direct and indirect cost of us 150 billion per year in the us alone1 recent studies suggest that one out of five deaths is linked in one way or another to obesity1 since 1975 the obesity prevalence has almost tripled2 obesity is a main risk factor for many serious diseases such as type ii diabetes fatty liver cardiovascular diseases and cancer among others34 additionally obesity has important psychological impacts on patients resulting in a lower quality of life5 although obesity is recognized by the world health organization as one of the major challenges in public health in the twenty-first century2 there is still no clear-cut solution6 to date the food and drug administration fda has approved only five drugs or drug combinations for long-term obesity treatment orlistat lorcaserin liraglutide bupropion-naltrexone and phentermine-topiramate7 four other drugs are fda-approved for short-term use benzphetamine phentermine phendimetrazine and diethylpropion7 very recently lorcaserin was withdrawn from the us market as a safety clinical trial showed an increased occurrence of cancer8 meanwhile the european medicines agency has approved only three medicines orlistat bupropion-naltrexone and liraglutide for obesity management in the european union9 thus developing new pharmacotherapies to treat obesity is of imminent importance to fulfill a highly unmet medical need a drug repurposing strategy also called repositioning is an approach for identifying new therapeutic uses for approved or investigational drugs10 these new uses are usually outside the original medical indication11 because of the high attrition rate escalating costs and long timeframes for new drug discovery drug repurposing is rapidly gaining ground10 the average cost of a successful drug repurposing is estimated to be us 300 million about a tenth of that of bringing a new chemical entity to the market12 since the repurposed drug successfully passed the safety assessment in preclinical studies and clinical trials the risk of failure is significantly lower10 the redirection of sildenafil which was originally developed as an antihypertensive agent to treat erectile dysfunction is a great example of successful drug repurposing the approval of thalidomide in 2006 to treat multiple myeloma is yet another example10 drug repurposing could also be a useful approach during outbreaks of emerging diseases such as the recent attempts to use the fda-approved human immunodeficiency virus hiv type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor lopinavir13 or the combination of the anti-malaria agent hydroxychloroquine with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin to overcome the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-1914 disulfiram dsf figure 1 is an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram blocks the alcohol metabolism at the acetaldehyde stage leading to the accumulation of the latter in the blood this in turn produces a highly unpleasant reaction which includes low blood pressure tachycardia facial flushing vomiting and vertigo when the patient treated with disulfiram ingests even small amounts of alcohol15 in 1951 disulfiram was the first drug to be approved by the fda to treat chronic alcoholism many studies since then have shown the potential of repurposing disulfiram as an anticancer agent16 currently disulfiram is progressing through different stages of clinical trials to treat diverse types of malignant tumors such as metastatic breast cancer glioblastoma and recurrent pancreatic carcinoma disulfiram has also shown therapeutic potential as a latency-reversing agent in treating aids patients1718 more recently disulfiram was shown to be beneficial in treating lyme disease and babesiosis19 in addition to inhibiting aldh2 the isoform responsible for alcohol metabolism disulfiram even more potently inhibits aldh1a120 the cytosolic isoform that irreversibly converts retinaldehyde rald into retinoic acid2122 the expression of aldh1a1 is significantly higher in obese patients compared to lean subjects23 furthermore the disruption of expression or function of this enzyme in rats rendered them resistant to diet-induced obesity24 moreover aldh1a1 deficient adipocytes were shown not only to effectively reduce body weight of mice fed a high-fat diet hfd2526 but also they markedly reduced waist circumference body weight and fat mass when implanted into visceral fat depots of obese large animal models such as dogs27 additionally aldh1a1-deficient mice are viable and do not show any growth or survival defects28 thus inhibiting the function of aldh1a1 is clearly an attractive approach to treating obesity in this study we showed that disulfiram can not only effectively reduce the body weight of obese rats but that it also prevents weight gain induced by an hfd in rats standard diet sd was purchased from grains silos  flour mills organization sa item no f1005 sd is composed of 20 protein 4 fat and 50

 retinoids and the enzymes controlling their metabolism form a complex system that controls important biological processes such as fuel metabolism and adipogenesis232431 aldh1a1- mice are known to be resistant to diet-induced obesity and they show better insulin sensitivity than their wildtype counterparts2331 disulfiram is a known inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenases15 it is an fda-approved drug for treating chronic alcoholism disulfiram is considered a safe well tolerated drug32 a single oral dose of 6 g or daily doses of up to 075 g administered for months are generally tolerated by human adults without symptoms3334 disulfiram is also characterized by a high oral ld50 dose of up to 86 gkg in rats35 indeed disulfiram is a potent inhibitor of both isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenase ald1a1 and aldh2 but since aldh1a1 has bigger substrate entrance tunnel than aldh2 disulfiram a rather large hydrophobic compound has a higher affinity to aldh1a120 in this work we investigated the potential use of disulfiram as a treatment for obesity our results showed that despite the fact that dsf had no significant effect on food intake it considerably limited the body weight gain of treated animals caused by an hfd when administered at a moderate dose of 50 mgkgday to rats along with an hfd dsf completely cancelled the obesogenic effect of the diet after six weeks of treatment hfd-fed rats treated at higher doses of dsf 200 mgkgday showed a strong resistance to body weight increase they gained less weight compared not only to their counterparts receiving hfd but also to those on a standard diet dsf also considerably decreased the body weight of obese animals at both doses of 50 and 200 mgkgday after three weeks of dsf treatment obese rats lost up to 24 of their weight thus restoring a body weight matching that of those who received a standard diet all in all disulfiram an fda-approved drug showed promising anti-obesity activity on high-fat diet-fed rats at both tried doses these findings suggest disulfiram as a potential treatment for obesity future studies should focus on the molecular mechanisms of disulfiram clinical trials on healthy obese adults could also be envisaged
