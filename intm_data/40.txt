genotyping coronavirus sars-cov-2 methods and implications changchuan yin  the emerging global infectious covid-19 coronavirus disease by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late december 2019 in china the virus has gone through various pathways of evolution for understanding the evolution and transmission of sars-cov-2 genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance we present an accurate method for effectively genotyping sars-cov-2 viruses using complete genomes the method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the sars-cov-2 reference genome the snp genotypes are then measured by jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates the genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations the genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the s proteins and rna polymerase rna primase and nucleoprotein undergo frequent mutations these mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control  we genotyped 558 sars-cov-2 isolates from the globe as of march 23 2020  frequent mutations in sars-cov-2 genomes are in the genes encoding the s protein and rna polymerase rna primase and nucleoprotein  we established a method for monitoring and tracing sars-cov-2 mutations  the novel coronavirus in humans first discovered in wuhan china in december 2019 was initially named as 2019-ncov and then designated as sars-cov-2 due to its taxonomic and genomic relationships with the species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus gorbalenya et al 2020  the present outbreak of the coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease is named coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 by who since the epidemic of covid-19 more than 332 930 people from 147 countries and territories have been confirmed sicked and more than 14 510 have died from the rapidly-spreading sars-cov-2 virus as of march 23 2020 who 2020  coronaviruses covs are a family of enveloped positive-strand rna viruses infecting vertebrates named for the crown-like spikes on their surface coronavirus cov belongs to the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales coronavirus is widely spread in humans other mammals and birds and can cause diseases such as the respiratory intestinal liver and nervous systems human coronaviruses hcovs were first identified in the mid-1960s seven common hcovs are cov-229e alpha coronavirus cov-nl63 alpha coronavirus cov-oc43 beta coronavirus cov-hku1 beta coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and current sars-cov-2 cov-229e and cov-oc43 are the cause of the common cold in adults during the mid-1960s disease manifestations associated with cov-hku1 and cov-nl63 include the common cold and chronic pneumonia coronavirus-hku1 has been predominantly reported in children in the united states but less common among adults three highly pathogenic coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 which emerged in 2002 2012  and 2019 respectively have caused severe respiratory disease and thousands of deaths worldwide chen 2020  sars-cov-2 coronavirus harbors a linear single-stranded positive rna genome the coronavirus sars-cov-2 genome consists of a leader sequence orf1ab encoding proteins for rna replication and genes for non-structural proteins nps and structural proteins the genomic leader sequence of about 265 bp is the unique characteristic in coronavirus replication and plays critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its discontinuous sub-genomic replication li et al 2005  orf1ab encodes replicase polyproteins required for viral rna replication and transcription  expression of the c-proximal portion of orf1ab requires -1 ribosomal frame-shifting the first non-structural protein nsp encoded by orf1ab is papain-like proteinase pl proteinase nps3 nsp3 is an essential and largest component of the replication and transcription complex the pl proteinase in nsp3 cleaves nsps 1-3 and blocks host innate immune response promoting cytokine expression serrano et al 2009 lei et al 2018  nsp4 encoded in orf1ab is responsible for forming double-membrane vesicle dmv the other nsp are 3clpro protease 3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase 3clpro and nsp6 3clpro protease is essential for rna replication the 3clpro proteinase is accountable for processing the c-terminus of nsp4 through nsp16 in all coronaviruses anand et al 2003  therefore conserved structure and catalytic sites of 3clpro may serve as attractive targets for antiviral drugs kim et al 2012  together nsp3 nsp4 and nsp6 can induce dmv angelini et al 2013  sars-coronavirus rna replication is unique involving two rna-dependent rna polymerases rna pol the first rna polymerase is primer-dependent non-structural protein 12 nsp12 and the second rna polymerase is nsp8 in contrast to nsp12 nsp8 has the primase capacity for de novo replication initiation without primers te velthuis et al 2012  nsp7 and nsp8 are important in the replication and transcription of sars-cov-2 the sars-coronavirus nsp7 and nsp8 complex is a multimeric rna polymerase for both de novo initiation and primer extension prentice et al 2004 te velthuis et al 2012  nsp8 also interacts with orf6 accessory protein nsp9 replicase protein of sars-coronavirus binds rna and interacts with nsp8 for its functions sutton et al 2004  furthermore the sars-cov-2 genome encodes four structural proteins the structural proteins possess much higher immunogenicity for t cell responses than the non-structural proteins li et al 2008  the structural proteins are involved in various viral processes including virus particle formation the structural proteins include spike s envelope e membrane protein m and nucleoprotein n which are common to all coronaviruses marra et al 2003 ruan et al 2003  the spike s protein is a glycoprotein which has two domains s1 and s2 spike protein s1 attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor ace2 initiating the infection wong et al 2004  after the internalization of the virus into the endosomes of the host cells the s glycoprotein is induced by conformation changes the s protein is then cleaved by cathepsin ctsl and unmasked the fusion peptide of s2 therefore activating membranes fusion within endosomes spike protein domain s2 mediates fusion of the virion and cellular membranes by acting as a class i viral fusion protein especially the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus sars-cov-2 contains a furin-like cleavage site coutard et al 2020  the furin recognition site is important for being recognized by pyrolysis and therefore contributing to the zoonotic infection of the virus the envelope e protein interacts with membrane protein m in the budding compartment of the host cell the m protein holds dominant cellular immunogenicity liu et al 2010  nucleoprotein orf9a packages the positive-strand viral rna genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid rnp during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein m he et al 2004  nucleoprotein plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral rna transcription as well as viral replication the increasing epidemiological and clinical evidence implicates that the sars-cov-2 has stronger transmission power than sars-cov and lower pathogenicity guan et al 2020  however the mechanism of high transmission of sars-cov-2 is unclear dna sequence comparisons using single nucleotide polymorphisms snps are often used for evolutionary studies and can be especially beneficial in recognizing the mutated coronavirus genomes where high mutations can occur due to an error-prone rna-dependent rna polymerase in genome replication to understand the virus evolution of sars-cov-2 from the genome mutation context we establish the snp genotyping method and investigate the genotype changes during the transmission of sars-cov-2 our results show that the genotypes of the virus are not uniformly distributed among the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 this genotyping study discovers a few highly frequent mutations in the sars-cov-2 genomes the highly frequent snp mutations might be associated with the changes in transmissibility and virulence of the virus the mutations are located in the s protein rna polymerase rna primase and nucleoprotein which are fundamental proteins for vaccine efficacy therefore the high-frequency snp mutations are important factors when developing vaccines for preventing the infection of sars-cov-2 coronavirus  the snp mutations including nucleotide changes and the corresponding positions in a genome are called an snp profile the snp profiles of sars-cov-2 isolates are retrieved and parsed from the aligned genomes according to the reference genome sars-cov-2 the snp profile of the complete genome of a virus can be considered as the genotype of the virus the jaccard similarity coefficient ja b of two sets a and b is defined as the intersection size of the two sets divided by the union size of two sets equation 1 levandowsky and winter 1971  the jaccard distance is a metric on the collection of finite sets the jaccard distance d j a b of two sets a and b is scored by the difference between 100 and the jaccard similarity coefficient equation 2 the jaccard distance measure of snp variants takes account of the ordering of snp mutations therefore the genetic distance of two genomes corresponds to the jaccard distance of their snp variants the jaccard distance of snp variants was adopted in the phylogenetic analysis of human or bacterial genomes comas et al 2009 yu et al 2017 yin and yau 2019  in this study we use the jaccard distance of the snp mutations of virus genomes to measure the dissimilarity of virus isolates because a mutation is rarely reversed more snps in a virus occur along time let a and b represent two snp sets of the virus if a is the subset of b ie a  b a  b then b can be considered as one of as descendants a and a can be considered as the ancestor of b to this end we propose the directed jaccard distance d j a b of two snp sets a and b as the measure of mutual relationship equation 3 in all the descendants of an snp a the closest descendant is the one having the minimum d j a b of the a descendant sets for two snp sets a and b if a  b   a  b and b  a then the two viruses are relatives sharing common snp mutations if two snp sets are neither descendant-ancestor nor relatives the corresponding two viruses are isolated mutants hence the relevance of virus isolates can be identified from the directed jaccard measure on the snp genotypes though the source of sars-cov-2 varies we still consider the virus samples were randomly collected for sequencing if a virus strain among all sequenced viruses has many descendants in the genome set we infer that this strain is conferred with high transmissibility therefore the snp mutations in this strain are critical for increased transmissibility we calculate the directed jaccard distances of the snp mutations to identify the relationships of virus strains therefore we may determine the virus transmission pattern the pipeline for snp genotyping and analysis is described in algorithm 1 the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 strains output snp genotypes of sars-cov-2 strains step 1 divide the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 strains into subsets based on the originating territories 2 add the reference genome of sars-cov-2 to each subset of the complete genomes 3 perform multiple sequence alignments for each subset genomes using clustal omega 4 convert the alignment files to snp profiles using the reference genome of sars-cov-2 5 merge the snp profiles of all virus genomes 6 calculate the pairwise directed jaccard distances of all the snps profiles 7 analyze the descendants ancestors and relative relationships of each snp genotype from the jaccard distances algorithm 1 snp genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 the genomic analytics is performed using computer programs in python and biopython libraries cock et al 2009  the computer programs and the updated snp profiles of sars-cov-2 isolates are available upon requests we retrieve the snp genotypes of 442 sars-cov-2 strains in gisaid database from the globe to investigate the snp distributions among all the virus isolates we plot the snp profiles of all the virus isolates from the globe and compare the frequency of each snp mutation in the virus sets the results show large mutation diversity in these virus isolates from the mutation frequency analysis the mutations are due to the fact that rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of rna viruses lacks proofreading however the mutations are not equally distributed the snp mutations can be single mutation and multiple mutations at a few fixed positions the impacts and roles that these snp mutations have on the pathogenicity and transmission ability of sars-cov remain to be determined by biochemical experiments these divers mutations might impact both transmissibility and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 the first common snp mutation in the sars-cov-2 genome is in the leader sequence 241ct an important genomic site for discontinuous sub-genomic replication the leader sequence mutation 241ct is co-evolved with three important mutations 3037ct 14408ct and 23403ag which result in amino acid mutations in nsp3 synonymous mutation rna primase p323l and spike glycoprotein s protein d614g respectively these three co-mutations 241ct 14408ct and 23403ag are in critical proteins for rna replication 241ct 14408ct and the s protein 23403ag for binding to ace2 receptor we observe that these four co-mutations are prevalent in the virus isolates from europe where infections covid-19 by sars-cov-2 are generally more severe than other geographical regions combined these four co-mutations probably can confer increased transmissibility of the virus sars-coronavirus rna replication is unique involving two rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrp the first rna polymerase is primer-dependent non-structural protein 12 nsp12 whereas the second rna polymerase is nsp8 nsp8 has the primase capacity for de novo initiation rna replication without primers te velthuis et al 2012  the most abundant snp mutation in sars-cov-2 isolates is 28144tc in nsp8 protein in which amino acid leucine l is mutated to serine s our result is consistent with a previous study on 103 sars-cov-2 genomes in which sars-cov-2 virus is classified as s and l types by the two co-mutations 8782ct and 28144tc zhang et al 2020  the third abundant snp mutation is 26144gt in nonstructural protein 3 nsp3 g251v the protein nsp3 works with nsp4 and nsp6 to induce double-membrane vesicles dmv membrane complex that acts as a platform for rna replication and assembly angelini et al 2013  the significant snp mutation 23403ag is located in the gene encoding spike glycoprotein s protein d614g the s protein in the sars-cov-2 virus is an important determinant of the host range and pathogenicity the s protein attaches the virion to the cell membrane by binding with the host ace2 receptor xiao et al 2003  the mutation d614g is located in the putative s1-s2 junction region near the furin recognition site r667 for the cleavage of s protein when the viron enters or exists cells follis et al 2006  however the actual functional impact of this high-frequency snp mutation 23403ag in the s protein d614g is unclear the affinity strength of the mutation s protein d614g with the ace2 receptor shall be further determined by biochemical experiments especially the snp analytics result also shows that the primer independent rna primase nsp8 contains more mutations than any other proteins 28144tc 28881ga 28881ga 28882ga and 28883gc the rna polymerase and primase mutations may confer resistance to mutagenic nucleotide analogs via increased fidelity the previous study indicated that a single mutation in rna polymerase can improve the replication fidelity in rna virus pfeiffer and kirkegaard 2003  if a mutation is lethal or reduces the transmission ability the mutations may not be carried on or get deceased the snp profiles demonstrate that the mutations in the envelope glycoprotein and rna polymerases predominate only the mutations in the s protein that have strongly binding to cell ace2 receptors while escape from immune system response can have chances to survive therefore these critical mutations are the results of natural selection in virus evolution in the sars-cov-2 strains found in the us the nucleocapsid n protein gene has three mutations 28881ga 28882ga and 28883gc the n protein of sars-cov is responsible for the formation of the helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly the n protein may cause an immune response and has potential value in vaccine development zhao et al 2005  these mutations shall be considered when developing a vaccine using the n protein  to spread a pathogen virus must multiply within the host to ensure transmission while simultaneously avoiding host morbidity or death therefore during the evolution of a virus the transmissibility of the virus is usually increased whereas the pathogenicity becomes reduced alizon et al 2009  from the snp profiles of sars-cov-2 strain high-frequency mutations predominate in the virus isolations therefore these high-frequency mutations probably contribute to increased transmissibility in addition these high-frequency mutations are associated with different critical proteins we analyze and trace the snp profiles from 442 sars-cov-2 strains which have at least 10 descendants the result suggests a number of high-frequency mutations that are associated with different critical proteins the results show that the snp distribution is not random but is predominated at some positions and then have more descendants these high-frequency mutations may confer a high transmissibility of the virus table 2  if we exclude the leader sequence mutation and the synonymous mutations 3037ct 8782ct 18060ct we classify the snp mutations into four major groups based on the impacted proteins fig 2  1 single mutation in nsp6 11083gt fig2a  2 single mutation in orf3a 26144gt fig2b  3 single mutation in rna polymerase nsp8 8782ct 28144tc fig2c  and 4 double mutations in s-protein and rna polymerase 241ct 3037ct 14408ct 23403ag   fig2d  these strains in one group are derived from the same ancestor stain in that group according to their snp profiles the result shows that most snp mutations in sars-cov-2 isolates in china and some from europe and usa are located at two positions 8782ct 28144t-c fig2c  later on this strain was mutated at new position 8782ct 28144tc 18060ct these mutations are from the early phase of the strain the important and prevalent co-mutations 241ct 3037ct 23403ag occurred mostly in sars-cov-2 isolates in europe countries this strain then has additional extended mutations at positions 241ct 3037ct 14408ct 23403ag  fig2d  the impacted critical proteins are na pol nsp8 rna primase nsp12 and the s protein most of the strains are found in europe countries  fig2d  italy is being heavily infected by sars-cov-2 with 59 138 confirmed cases and 5 476 deaths as of march 23 2020 who 2020 these critical mutations probably may be correlated with the severe infections in europe from the snp profiles of the viruses across the globe from a different time we may estimate that one mutation can occur in one generation for example in usa il two consecutive infection cases usil1epiisl4042532020-01-21usil2epiisl4100452020-01-28 the virus increased one mutation 28854cy between two same community members over the length of its 30kb genome sars-cov-2 may accumulate mutations ranging from single mutation to 14 mutations nlepiisl4135912020-03-02 as seen from december 2019 to march 23 2020 therefore we may estimate that the transmission of sars-cov-2 has reached 14 generations since its first infection to humans in december 2019 besides the snps mutations we also observed a few deletion or insertion mutations in sars-cov-2 isolates the deletion-insertion mutations do not happen often however whether these deletion and insertion mutations can spread is unknown from the limited genome data our study has a few notable limitations due to the nature of the genome data because the sample collection dates may not reflect the actual infection date so the transmission path analysis is only approximate caution should be exercised on the genotyping analytics because some countries have not sequenced enough virus samples the frequencies of the genotype groups may be unbalanced due to the unavailability of complete genomes in some countries and regions whether any of these common snp mutations will result in biological and clinical differences remains to be determined in this study we use the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 for snp genotype calling however in an emergency time the complete genomes may not be available for snp genotyping in this case the snp variant calling process may directly use the raw ngs reads yin and yau 2019  the snp variants then can be obtained by mapping the ngs reads to the reference genome by bwa alignments li 2013  followed by gatk variant calling mckenna et al 2010  the sars-cov-2 epidemic has caused a substantial health emergency and economic stress in the world therefore understanding the nature of this virus and deriving methods to monitor the spread of virus in the epidemic are critical in disease control our results show several molecular facets of the sars-cov-2 pertinent to this epidemic the discovery of genotypes linked to geographic and temporal clusters of infectious suggests that genome snp signatures can be used to track and monitor the epidemic rapid detection of different genotypes of sars-cov-2 are important for an efficient response to the covid-19 outbreak discriminating and relating viral isolates can be useful in genetic epidemiology determining the origin and monitoring the transmission pattern of the pathogenic agents are critical to controlling the outbreak in this work the snp genotyping of sars-cov-2 was developed by adapting fast msa of the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 and snp analytics using the directed jaccard distance of the snp profiles the genotyping analysis provides insights on the frequent mutations that confer fast transmissibility of the virus the major mutations are in the critical proteins including the s protein rna polymerase rna primase and nucleoprotein therefore these high-frequency snp mutation sites must be considered when designing a vaccine for preventing the infection of sars-cov-2  we sincerely appreciate the researchers worldwide who sequenced and shared the complete genome data of sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses from gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg this research is dependent on these precious data  distinct genetic spectrums and evolution patterns of sars-cov-2 sheng liu jikui shen lei yang chang-deng hu jun wan   a novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 1 causing human coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was first reported in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 24 the pandemic ofsars-cov2 has infected more than 6 million people over 180 countries and areas around the world with a death totally up-to 370000 as of may 26 2020 5 the most vulnerable group in this covid-19 pandemic is elderly and those with different underlying medical conditions such as malnourished hypertensive diabetic cancer and cardiovascular abnormality 6 much effort has been devoted by scientists all over the world to understand the features of sars-cov2 to date more than 30000 sars-cov-2 whole genome sequences have been uploaded to the online platform gisaid 7 8 analyzing these data can potentially reveal the viral transmission routes and to identify novel mutations associated with the transmission 9 for example researchers employed standard phylogenomics approaches and compared consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage within each infected host 10 11 such information will be of important value for the development of vaccine transmission monitoring and ultimately the control of the pandemic like other virus sars-cov-2 exhibited dynamic transmission patterns during its spreading the genome of sars-cov-2 may create random mutations over time it has been reported that sars-cov-2 mutated at an average speed of about one or two mutations per month 12 however only some of mutations were caught and corrected by the viruss error correction machinery 13 these signature mutations may help understand the origin and evolution of sars-cov-2 given 103 earlier genome sequence data at least two clades of sars-cov-2 were found to be involved in the global transmission based on t - c mutation on a singleton site at 28144 of the complete genome which was further termed as s clade c28144 and l clade t28144 14 evolutionary analyses suggested s clade appeared to be more related o coronaviruses in animals most recently three major clusters of snvs involved in the pandemic were found by comparing 160 sars-cov-2 genomes 15 with ratg13 coronavirus 11 however most of these studies were based on limited numbers of sars-cov-2 genomes which might lead to debating conclusions 12 1519 with the availability of increased sample size and longer time of sars-cov-2 spreading and developing which has covered almost all countries in the world now it is imperative to provide a comprehensive and updated analysis of the viral genetic variations in this study we took advantage of the larger datasets collected by gisaid which published about 20000 high quality sars-cov-2 genomes with high converge until may 26 2020 isolated from patients in 87 countries our comprehensive analyses clearly revealed distinct patterns of four major group mutations prominent in different countries and areas we attempted to uncover novel dynamic transmission and evolution paths for specific sars-cov-2 variants during the first several months of covid-19 outbreak some cases were found to have multiple groups of mutations simultaneously even though the numbers of cases were not high comparing with four bat coronavirus genomes we found that alternations of nucleotides on sars-cov-2 genome tend to occur at the same sites where bat coronavirus sequences were different from wuhan-hu-1 particularly some of nucleotide substitutions on sars-cov-2 were apt to be the same as ratg13 coronavirus sequences we further investigated the amino acid aa changes on furin and rna binding domain rbd of spike protein our novel genome-wide discoveries shed the light and provide more detailed information of sars-cov-2 which has been clouding over the world we downloaded and analyzed 19411 sars-cov-2 complete genome sequences after excluding low-coverage ones from the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg 7 8 as of may 26 2020 using wuhan-hu-1 ncbi reference sequence nc0455122 gisaid id epiisl402125 as reference genome we found total 9986 nucleotide sites with single nucleotide variations snvs among all samples majority of snvs had very low occurrence frequency as shown in figure 1a suggesting a high chance of random mutations four nucleotide substitutions were identified in over 70 of genome sequences a23403g c3037t c14408t and c241t they distributed at distinct sars-cov-2 genome locations on the gene body of spike orf1a and orf1ab and upstream of orf1ab respectively additionally there were other 52 unique snvs arose from larger than 1 of populations n  194 it is interesting that some of these frequent snvs co-occurred with overlapping ratio larger than 09 see methods which were connected by blue lines in figure 1a they may appear across different proteins for example a23403g and c14408t were found simultaneously on 72 samples while a23403g changes an aspartate to a glycine on spike and c14408t converts a proline to a leucine on orf1ab among total 56 frequent snvs 29 mutations are nonsynonymous variants figure 1b some of them have been discussed separately by previous studies 11 14 20 or marked as elements in clades g s and v from the gisaid report 7 8 here two-way clustering was performed with distance function of one minus jaccard index on 56 frequent snvs and about 20000 samples figure 1b it is clear to see four major groups of snvs covering approximately 96 of samples including a c14408ta23403g occurring on 14055 samples b t28144c on 2088 samples c g11083tg26144t on 2243 samples and d g1440ag2891a on 347 samples the geographical locations of infected patients bearing these special mutations were very different thirty-seven countries and areas with virus sample numbers larger than 50 were chosen to investigate the geographical distributions of these snvs group a represented by two nonsynonymous mutations a23403g andor c14408t represents totally 72 of samples in the study including about 82 of samples from europe and 67 of north america the top three countries with the highest ratio in group a figure 2a were russia 90 switzerland 97 and denmark 96 group b was distinguished by nonsynonymous mutation t28144c which results in substitution of a leucine by a serine on orf8 it was projected in thailand 42 china 35 spain 32 and some other asian countriesareas figure 2b group c was featured by one synonymous c14805t and two nonsynonymous snvs g11083t and g26144t figure 1b which substituted a leucine with a phenylalanine on orf1ab and a glycine with a valine on orf3a respectively this group existed in many asian and european countries and areas eg hong kong japan singapore england iceland turkey etc figure 2c as reported previously 7 8 11 14 20 group d includes two nonsynonymous snvs g1440a and g2891a both of which change the amino acid sequences on orf1ab it confirms the clade d previously defined by guan et al 20 based on smaller set of patients g1440a led to the amino acid change g212d on nonstructural protein 2 nsp2 while g2891a caused a58t on nonstructural protein 3 nsp3 d-group was mainly found in several european countries eg wales 17 germany 12 and belgium 5 figure 2d besides featured snvs in each major group some snvs co-occurred with the same signature snvs but covered smaller populations importantly many non-major snvs were mutually exclusively presented with each other in different countries and areas figure 1b for instance about 20 mutations co-occurred with a23403g and c14408t in the group a but composed sub-types of a figure 1b taken as an example both g25563t and c1059t were found in group a however two separable sets of cases were associated with the combinations of g25563t and c1059t figure 2a sub-cluster a1 including both g25563t and c1059t and sub-cluster a2 including g25563t but excluding c1059t they represented different strains that were found in distinct populations from varied countries specifically a1 occurred on 23 of all worldwidely collected sar-cov-2 genomes particularly in 71 of denmark 54 of israel and 52 of usa whereas a2 was found in only 5 population level which were mostly discovered in saudi arabia 71 turkey 38 and columbia 33 another sub-cluster a3 had consecutive mutations at positions 28881-28883 on sars-cov-2 complete genome leading a nonframeshift substitution on orf9 a3 occupied in 23 of worldwide cases represented by three major countries and areas russia 67 norther ireland 62 and greece 62 some sub-clusters of mutations were found in around 5 or lesser worldwide cases but they were significantly overrepresented in several major countries and areas for instance a4 with synonymous mutation c15324t was detected in an african country democratic republic of the congo drc approximately 66 of drc samples had mutation c15324t coming together with 35 of switzerland and 29 of luxembourg patients from one country might have different main groups or sub-types of mutations a synonymous a20268g in cluster a5 figure 2a was sampled in spain 45 scotland 22 and iceland 20 it is interesting that other 32 of spain had another distinguished nonsynonymous mutation t28144c in group b figure 2b most of spain samples 20 of total in group b also had a unique mutation c28863t substituting a serine with a leucine on orf9 co-occurring with t28144c a large population of australia samples were found in group b as well but they came with additional diverse mutually exclusive mutations eg either c18060ta17858gc17747t 8 or c28863t 7 or g28077c 4 similar scenarios were observed in usa where approximately 21 of samples encompassed t28144c with c18060ta17858gc17747t while another 3 was recognized with a different nonsynonymous mutation g28077c in the same main group b group c including g11083t and g26144t existed in many asian and european countries and areas figure 2c such as hong kong japan singapore england iceland and turkey as reported previously 11 however different countries and areas were distinguished by extra mutations in the same main group c for example over 80 of hong kong samples were detected with nonsynonymous g26144t on orf3a while singapore had over 80 samples with nonsynonymous mutation c28311t on orf9 interestingly a synonymous mutation c14805t existed in both group b and c figure 1b covering over 8 of worldwide samples although majority 85 of c14805t was a signature mutation in group c g11083tg26144t in over 10 patients of europe and north america c14805t also co-occurred with t9477ag25979tc28863t in group b which were mostly found in spain 20 and australia 7 figure 2b currently it lacks sufficient evidences to make a conclusive statement about the origins of all sars-cov-2 mutations but time-annotated data collections can still explore geographical evolution patterning of specific snvs albeit the limited number of high quality and high coverage sequenced viral genomes for example only three cases with mutations t28144c and c18060t one sub-type in group b reported in washington state of usa in january 2020 in addition to seven cases in china and additional one in singapore at almost same time figure 3a it is notable that t28144c and c18060t co-occurred with additional de novo nonsynonymous mutations c17747ta17858g on orf1ab on 52 cases in february 2020 51 from washington state of usa and one from grand princess cruise no such case was detected in other countries and areas one month later this group of signature mutations spread over many states of usa particularly west coast of usa and other countries and areas of different continents including australia canada iceland mexico england and taiwan etc over half of american patients had been sampled with mutations c14408ta23403g and c1059t on sars-cov-2 genome figure 2a in january 2020 only one case with both c14408t and a23403g was found from china in our dataset figure 3b the first case in usa was reported in new hampshire at east coast with co-occurrence of c1059t in addition to five in france one in belgium and one in senegal the numbers of such cases boosted up in usa and other countries in march 2020 including 354 in denmark 163 in australia and tens in france england etc in the usa approximately 800 cases were found on east coast of usa while over 400 cases were identified on west coast as well the mutations of group a c14408ta23403g indicated at least two strains of sars-cov-2 distinguishable on the sites of spike and orf1ab one observed from wuhan-hu-1was named as dp with an aspartate on 614 of spike and a proline on 4715 of orf1ab while another potential one gl had a glycine on the site of 614 on spike and a leucine on the site of 4715 on orf1ab instead the ratio of gl strain in all usa cases increased dramatically from 6 in february to 96 in may 2020 figure 3c the similar growing trend was observed in most of other countries regardless when this group of mutations were first present figure 3c in general 96 of samples from all these countries had strain gl in may 2020 compared to only 3 in february figure 3d suggesting that the gl strain of sars-cov-2 might become much more stable and prevailing than the other strain dp from wuhan-hu-1 after 6-month evolution and transmission different groups of mutations also exhibited distinguished evolution patterns in countries selected in the study figures 3c and d taking b-group snvs for example we found that the ratio decreased over time from 33 in january 2020 to 0 in may in these countries indicating that at least two strains existed at the early of covid-19 pandemic however strains including variant at 28144 other than wuhan-hu-1 disappeared after 6-months of transmission only the strain that has the same nucleotide t28144 as wuhan-hu-1 finally became the most stabilized strain found in the host the similar patterns were observed for groups c and d as well even though a sudden increasing was found in march 2020 due to unknown reasons for instance germany had a high ratio 478 11 out of 23 of samples with snvs g1440a and g2891a in february while 25 of 96 out of 384 wales were sampled the same mutations in march 2020 four main groups of mutations mutually exclusively occurred in most of 20000 patients in our study indicating a unique viral strain in the host however as reported in early of march 2020 a patient hospitalized in iceland infected by two sars-cov-2 subtypes simultaneously 21 one strain of the sars-ncov-2 coronavirus was more aggressive according to reykjavik grapevine newspaper citing ceo of code genetics biopharmaceutical company kari stefansson the second strain is a mutation from the original version of the coronavirus that appeared in wuhan china this was regarded as the first known case of double infection gudbjartsson et al 22 reported that patient t25 carries both the a2a1a strain and the a2a1a25958 strain as shown in figure 4 11 genomes bore both a-group and b-group mutations while 194 genomes had group variants of a and c and both b-group and c-group were involved in 27 genomes strikingly one patient from spain was detected with three groups of mutations simultaneously a b and c the sars-cov-2 genomes with novel d-group mutations were not overlapped with either a or b but 14 out of 333 genomes embraced group c as well bats have been thought to be reservoir species for many infectious diseases including sars-cov-2 in order to understand the possible association between snvs among sars-cov-2 genome sequences from patients and bat coronavirus sequences we aligned four bat coronavirus sequences to wuhan-hu-1 complete genome the ratios of variants between wuhan-hu-1 and bats were 39 ratg13 117 bat-sl-covzc45 120 bat-sl-covzxc21 and 58 rmyn02 as previously described 9986 out of 29903 nts 334 on sars-cov-2 genome underwent variations among about 20000 samples interestingly all four bats coronavirus in our study showed significantly the least p  58e-46 elevated ratios of sars-cov-2 snvs on the sites where bats sequences differed from sars-cov-2 compared to that on sars-cov-2 complete genome figure 5a suggesting that the sites where sars-cov-2 differ from bats might have higher tolerance for sequence mutations among them ratg13 coronavirus covered the higher ratio 533 than bat-sl-covzc45 449 bat-sl-covzxc21 449 and 58 rmyn02 497 in theory 9986 nucleotide variants among 20000 sars-cov-2 genomes can potentially turn to be any one of three nucleotides other than original ones from wuhan-hu-1 but it turned out that sars-cov-2 snvs had the same mutated nucleotides as ratg13 coronavirus does on 430 out of 1156 372 sites where ratg13 coronavirus sequence differed from wuhan-hu-1 figure 5b including c29095t 11 and seven high frequent snvs identified from major groups eg c2416t and c3037t from group a c8782t c18060t c24034t and t28144c from group b and c23929t in group c the ratio for ratg13 coronavirus was much higher than the ratios around 24 observed in other three bat coronavirus sequences similar to sars coronavirus sars-cov-2 entered human cells through its high-affinity receptor-binding domain rbd and its proteolytic proteases to human protein ace2 which enables an efficient cell entry 23 group a had a significant mutation at a23403g leading to aa change d614g on spike protein this mutation was discussed as clade g 7 8 covering over 70 of total sequenced genomes 96 in may in our study in addition cryo-em-based structural analysis 24 revealed that 5 key amino acids within 434-507 of spike protein contributed most to the binding activity this was also confirmed by several recent cryo-em structural studies 2528 the key aas of sars-cov-2 rbd are l455 g482 v483 e484 g485 f486 q493 s494 and n501 interestingly we identified several nonsynonymous snvs of sars-cov-2 on l455 v483 g485 and s494 from sequenced sample for instance g22927t l455f g23009t v483f t23010c v483a g23105a g485s and t23042c s494p among them 28 viral genomes had mutation t23010c v483a all of which were sampled in usa including 26 from washington state furin is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage in sars-cov-2 15-nt cctcggcgggcacgt encodes five aas prrar 681-685 locating at 23603-23617 of wuhan-hu-1 complete genome furin cleavage site bears a rxxr pattern 29 30 r685 makes an ideal furin proteolytic cleavage site 31 twenty-eight sars-cov-2 genomes were detected with mutations in the region including 10 from england 7 from usa and 3 from switzerland the earliest case was a patient from hangzhou china nonsynonymous snvs c23604t was most frequent among all others causing the mutation of p681l other aa mutations included p681hp r682qw r683pq and a684vte in this study we comprehensively analyzed 19411 sars-cov-2 whole-genome sequences in gisaid viral portal until may 26 2020 as well as four bat genome sequences we explored the mutation patterns that distinguish patients from different countries and areas some of frequent snvs reported previously were identified and discussed individually we used bioinformatics approaches to systematically explore four mutually exclusive major groups of snvs on sars-cov-2 genome these mutations were detected in populations from different geographical locations one group consisting of two nonsynonymous mutations g1440a and g2891a was discovered in several european countries eg wales and germany both nonsynonymous mutations change the amino acid sequences on orf1 ab g1440a led to the aa change of g392d on orf1ab g212d on nonstructural protein 2 nsp2 while g2891a caused a876t on orf1ab a58t on nonstructural protein 3 nsp3 interestingly the structures of nsp2 and nsp3 predicted by i-tasser web site 32 showed that both nsp2 g212 and nsp3 a58 appear to be exposed to the solvent nsp2 g212d falls on the region which was homologous to the endosome-associated protein similar to the avian infectious bronchitis virus pdb 3ld1 which plays a key role in the viral pathogenicity 33 nsp3 a58t locates at n-terminal ubiquitin-like domain that plays an important role in viral replication as visualized by pymol 34 changes of g212d and a58t add clashes between residues 212 and asn183 between residues 59 and ile62 respectively supplemental figure 1 predictions by provean 35 suggest that these changes are neutral indicating they are stabilizing variants given the fact that over 300 patients have been detected with these two variants these results could provide some insights of possible new functions of some important proteins and their therapeutic potential comparing with other coronavirus distinct time-course evolution patterns were observed for four major groups of mutations the viral strains different from wuhan-hu-1 may gradually replace the earlier one detected from wuhan-hu-1 eg gl with mutations c14408t and a23403g or the strains same as wuhan-hu-1 at snv sites may become dominant after several month evolutions eg groups b-d figures 3c and d it is hard to make a solid conclusion about this kind of aberrant emergence of new strains based on current evidence particularly due to the lack of enough numbers of high-quality sequenced samples world widely including china before february 2020 however with more and more clinical data generated evolution patterning associated with specific biological functions may be clearly uncovered for example several groups recently reported that a23403g mutation in spike protein might alter the antigenic property and transmission ability due to the change of protomer interaction 36 37 in general four main groups of mutations were mutually exclusively presented the bioinformatics and computational analyses exhibited a few hundred patients who were identified to carry multiple major groups of snvs at the same time without clear clues that homologous recombination could occur in these viruses we just defined such overlaps as cross-infections based on our observations and current knowledge there are several scenarios about these cross-infections one possibility is that two or three strains co-existed and prevailed in the population of the same region during the periods alternatively the patients could be infected with one strain first then another one later suggesting that primary infection did not yield immunity against the subsequent infection from a different strain of course the percentage of cross-infection cases was very low when compared with approximately 20000 samples in this study it might be the consequences of the quarantine and lockdown policy enforced after the spread of covid-19 while social distancing and wearing face mask are considered effective approaches in reducing the chance of cross infection 3841 which reduced the likelihood that people met patients with different sars-cov-2 strains at the same time we further compared snvs among sars-cov-2 genomes on human patients to bat coronavirus nucleotides different from wuhan-hu-1 it is interesting that sars-cov-2 snvs particularly those high-frequent mutations tend to occur at the same sites where bats sequences varied from wuhan-hu-1 suggesting the high tolerance of these sites for genetic mutations or potentials of sars-cov-2 turning to a wild-type pathogenic phenotype ratg13 coronavirus was most similar to sars-cov-2 from perspective of sequences but it held the highest ratio of sars-cov-2 variants which became the same nucleotides as bats coronavirus sequences at the same sites this suggests that some strains of sars-cov-2 deviated from wuhan-hu-1 might be more similar to coronavirus in ratg13 than in other bats presented in this paper even though we dont have more evidence to show the exact connections between them our results may shed the light to search intermediate host and further understand the mechanisms of interspecies transmission in future in summary we attempted to uncover fundamental views of sars-cov-2 mutations which may help us understand functional consequences due to the viral genetic instability our efforts in exploring the patterns of sars-cov-2 transmission and evolution in different geographical locations can be helpful to fight against the pandemic our findings may provide useful insights on sars-cov-2 replication pathogenicity and even possible implications for drug discovery antibody design or vaccine development after being incorporated with other new published studies eg interaction maps between sars-cov-2 proteins and human proteins 42  critical sequence hot-spots for binding of ncov-2019 to ace2 as evaluated by molecular simulations mahdi ghorbani bernard brooks r jeffery klauda b  the novel coronavirus ncov-2019 outbreak has put the world on edge causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world as of june 2020 let alone the societal and economic impacts of the crisis the spike protein of ncov-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain rbd to the host cell surface receptor protein angiotensin converter enzyme ace2 our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how ncov-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ace2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics md simulations numerous mutations have been identified in the rbd of ncov-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world in this study we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other ala-scanning mutations on the stability of rbdace2 complex it is found that most of the naturallyoccurring mutations to the rbd either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ace2 as the wild-type ncov-2019 this may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants furthermore in-silico ala-scanning and long-timescale md simulations highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of rbd and ace2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors from an evolutional perspective this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor sars-cov and how it could further evolve to become more infectious  the novel coronavirus ncov-2019 outbreak emerging from china has become a global pandemic and a major threat for human public health according to world health organization who as of june 27 th 2020 there has been about 10 million confirmed cases and approaching 500000 deaths due to coronavirus in the world 1 2 much of the human population including the united states of america were under lockdown or official stay-at-home orders to minimize the continued spread of the virus coronaviruses are a family of single-stranded enveloped rna viruses phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus genome has shown that ncov-2019 belongs to the beta-coronavirus family which also includes mers-cov sars-cov and bat-sars-related coronaviruses 3 4 it is worth mentioning that sars-cov which was widespread in 2002 caused more than 8000 cases and about 800 deaths and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012 also spread in more than 25 countries causing about 2500 cases and more than 850 deaths wwwwhointhealth-topicscoronavirus 5 in all coronaviruses a homotrimeric spike glycoprotein on the virions envelope mediates coronavirus entry into host cells through a mechanism of receptor binding followed by fusion of viral and host membranes 3 6 coronavirus spike protein contains two functional subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit is responsible for binding to host cell receptor and the s2 subunit is responsible for fusion of viral and host cell membranes 3 7 the spike protein in ncov-2019 exists in a meta-stable pre-fusion conformation that undergoes a substantial conformational rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane 7 8 ncov-2019 is closely related to bat coronavirus ratg13 with about 931 sequence similarity in the spike protein gene the sequence similarity of ncov-2019 and sars-cov is less than 80 in the spike genome 2 s1 subunit in the spike protein includes a receptor binding domain rbd that recognizes and binds to the host cells receptor the rbd of ncov-2019 shares 728 sequence identity to sars-cov rbd and the root mean squared deviation rmsd for the structure between the two proteins is 1  which shows the high structural similarity 4 8 9 experimental binding affinity measurements using surface plasmon resonance spr have shown that ncov-3 fold higher affinity than sars-cov binding to ace2 7 based on the sequence similarity between rbd of ncov-2019 and sars-cov and also the tight binding between rbd of ncov-2019 and ace2 it is most probable that ncov-2019 uses this receptor on human cells to gain entry into the body 3 6 7 10 the spike protein and specifically the rbd domain in coronaviruses have been a major target for therapeutic antibodies however no monoclonal antibodies targeted to rbd have been able to bind efficiently and neutralize ncov-2019 7 11 the core of ncov-2019 rbd is a 5-  the sequence alignment between sars-cov in human sars civet bat ratg13 coronavirus and ncov-2019 in the rbm is shown in figure 2  there is a 50 sequence similarity between the rbm of ncov-2019 and sars-cov rbm mutations played an important role in the sars epidemic in 2002 12 3 two mutations in the rbm of sars-2002 from sars-civet were observed from strains of these viruses these two mutations were k479n and s487t these two residues are close to the virus binding hotspots in ace2 including hotspot-31 and hotspot-353 hotspot-31 centers on the salt-bridge between k31-e35 and hotspot-353 is centered on the salt-bridge between k353-e358 on ace2 residues k479 and s487 in sars-civet are in close proximity with these hotspots and mutations at these residues caused sars to bind ace2 with significantly higher affinity than sars-civet and played a major role in civet-to-human and human-to-human transmission of sars coronavirus in 2002 3 13 14 15 numerous mutations in the interface of sars-cov rbd and ace2 from different strains of sars isolated from humans in 2002 have been identified and the effect of these mutations on binding ace2 have been investigated by surface plasmon resonance 16 17 two identified rbd mutations y442f and l472f increased the binding affinity of sars-cov to ace2 and two mutations n479k t487s decreased the binding affinity it was demonstrated that these mutations were viral adaptations to either human or civet ace2 16 17 a pseudotyped viral infection assay of the interaction between different spike proteins and ace2 confirmed the correlation between high affinity mutants and their high infection 16 further investigation of rbd residues in binding of sars-cov and ace2 was performed through ala-scanning mutagenesis which resulted in identification of 10 residues that reduce binding affinity to ace2 upon mutation to alanine these residues are k390 r429 d429 d454 i455 n473 f483 q492 y494 and r495 18 rbd mutations have also been identified in mers-cov which affected their affinity to receptor dpp4 on human cells 17 it is not known whether these mutations are linked to the severity of coronavirus in these regions the focus of this article is to elucidate the differences between the interface of sars-cov and ncov-2019 with ace2 to understand with atomic resolution the interaction mechanism and hotspot residues at the rbdace2 interface using long-timescale molecular dynamics md simulation an alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the rbm of ncov-2019 helped to identify the key residues in the interaction which could be used as potential pharmacophores for future drug development furthermore we performed molecular simulations on the seven most common mutations found from surveillance of rbd mutations n439k t478i v483a g476s s494p v483f and a475v from an evolutionary perspective this study shows the residues in which the virus might further evolve to be even more dangerous to human health ncov-2019 shares 76 sequence similarity with sars-2002 spike protein 73 sequence identity for rbd and 50 for the rbm 1 bat coronavirus ratg13 seems to be the closest relative of ncov-2019 sharing about 93 sequence identity in the spike protein 6 the 25 the mutations selected are listed in table   s1 along with their location in rbd the crystal structure of ncov-2019 in complex with hace2 pdb id6m0j 28 as well as sars-cov complex with human ace2 pdb id 6acj 29 were obtained from rcsb wwwrcsborg 30 the 5000 steps of energy minimizations were done using the steepest descent algorithm in all steps the lincs algorithm was used to constraint all bonds containing hydrogen atoms and a time step of 2 fs was used as the integration time step 33 equilibration of all systems were performed in three steps in the first step 100000 steps of simulation were performed using a velocity-rescaling thermostat to maintain the temperature at 310k with a 01 ps coupling constant in nvt ensemble under periodic boundary conditions and harmonic restraints on the backbone and sidechain atoms of the complex 34 the velocity rescaling thermostat was used in all other steps of simulation in the next step we performed 300000 steps in the isothermalisobaric npt ensemble at temperature of 310k and pressure of 1bar using a berendsen barostat 35 this was done by decreasing the force constant of the restraint on backbone and side chain atoms of the complex from 1000 to 100 and finally to 10   berendsen barostat was only used for the equilibration step due to usefulness in rapidly correcting density in the next step the restraints were removed and the systems were subjected to 1000000 steps of md simulation under npt ensemble in the production run harmonic restraints were removed and all the systems were simulated using a npt ensemble where the pressure was maintained at 1bar using the parrinello-rahman barostat 36 with a compressibility of and a coupling constant of 05ps it is important to note that all the berendsen barostat was only used for the equilibration step as it was shown that this barostat can cause unrealistic temperature gradients 37 the production run lasted for 500ns for sars-cov and ncov-2019 complexes and 300ns for all the mutants using with a 2fs timestep and the particle-mesh ewald pme 36 for long range electrostatic interactions using gromacs 20183 package 38 all mutant systems were constructed as described before and all complexes ran for 300ns of production run the principal components were used to calculate and plot the approximate free energy landscape afel we refer to the free energy landscape produced by this approach to be approximate in that the ensemble with respect to the first few pcs lowest frequency quasiharmonic modes is not close to convergence but the analysis can still provide valuable information and insight gsham gcovar and ganaeig functions in gromacs 41 were used to obtain principal components and afel in each afel the deep valleys represent the most stable conformations separated by some intermediate states the dynamic cross-correlation maps dccm were obtained using mdtask package to identify the correlated motions of rbd residues 42 in dccm the cross-correlation matrix  by setting a value of 80 and 2 for solvent and solute dielectric constants the non-polar free energy is simply estimated from solvent accessible surface area sasa of the solute from equation 5 to compute the rmsd of systems the rotational and translational movements were removed by first fitting the c  atoms of the rbd to the crystal structure and then computing the rmsd with respect to c  atoms of rbd in each system in most of the variants the rmsd is stable during the 300ns simulation however a few mutations show some rmsd variance in mutation y489a the rmsd increases from the first two eigenvectors were used to calculate and plot the afel as a function of first two principal components using the last 200ns of the simulation for mutant systems afel for a few mutants are shown in figure 6 and the rest of them are shown in figure s4   the binding energetics between ace2 and the rbd of sars-cov ncov-2019 and all its mutant complexes were investigated by the mmpbsa method 44 for ncov-2019 the binding free energy for ncov-2019 and sars-cov was decomposed into a perresidue based binding affinity to find the residues that contribute strongly to the binding and complex formation figure 9  most of the investigated residues in the rbm of ncov-2019 had a favorable contribution to total binding energy binding free energy decomposition to its individual components for all mutants is represented in contributes the most to this low binding energies for these mutants the contribution of rbm residues to binding with ace2 for ncov-2019 were mapped to the rbd structure and is shown in figure 11b  natural mutants exhibited similar or higher binding affinities compared to wild-type ncov-2019 importantly mutation t478i which is one of the most occurred mutations in england based on gisaid database 25 table 1  contribution of interface residues to structure in rbd of ncov-2019 the rbd domain is purple and the ace2 is yellow the rbd in contact with ac2 is rendered in a surface format with more red being a favorable contribution to binding more negative and blue unfavorable contribution positive in this work we preformed md simulations to unveil the detailed molecular mechanism  d460 in sars-cov is located in a region of high negative charge from residues e35 e37 and d38 on ace2 electrostatic repulsion between d480 on sars-cov and the acidic residues on ace2 is the reason for highly negative contribution of this residue to binding of sars-cov to ace2 mutation to s494 in this location removes this highly negative contribution to our knowledge this is first detailed molecular simulation study on the effect of mutations on binding of ncov-2019 to ace2 previous computational studies have found that ncov-2019 binds to ace2 with a total binding affinity which was about 3 0 stronger than sars-cov and is in fair agreement with the results here 52 the critical role of interface residues and residues are computationally investigated here and in other articles and the results of all the studies indicate the importance of these residues for the stability of the complex and finding hotspot residues for the interaction with receptor ace2 47 52 53 54 it is interesting to note the role of shown there is a correlation between higher binding affinity to receptor and higher infection rate by coronavirus 55 56 57 58 high binding affinity for some mutants such as t478i could be the reason for higher human-to-human transmission rate in regions where these mutations are found it is also alerting that mutations at other residues such as g446a g449a y449a and y489a increase the binding affinity considerably and should be monitored mutations of ncov-2019 rbd that do not change the binding affinity and complex stability could have implications for antibody design purposes since they could act antibody escape mutants escape from monoclonal antibodies are observed for mutations of sars-cov in 2002 and these mutations should be considered for any antibody design endeavors against consider these escape mutations in conclusion this study unraveled key molecular traits underlying the higher affinity of ncov-2019 for ace2 compared to sars-cov and unveiled critical residues for the interaction higher affinity than wild-type other occurring mutations n439k and e484a are found to increase the electrostatic interaction of rbd with ace2 it is also alerting that some of the alanine substitutions at residues g446 g447 and y489 substantially increased the binding affinity that may lead to a strongly rbd attachment to ace2 and influence the infection virulence on the other hand most mutations are found not to impact the binding affinity of rbd with ace2 in ncov-2019 which could have implications for vaccine design endeavors as these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants receptor recognition is the first line of attack for coronavirus and this study gives novel insights to key structural features of interface residues for advancement of effective therapeutic strategies to stop the coronavirus pandemic the authors would like to dedicate this article to the doctors and nurses who sacrificed their time health and even their lives to fight covid-19 particularly those in iran and the united states jbk would also like to dedicate this work to family friend joe kaplan silver spring md who passed away due to covid-19 on april 22 2020  significance of coronavirus mutants in feces and diseased tissues of cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis niels pedersen c hongwei liu kimberly dodd a patricia pesavento a   feline infectious peritonitis fip was first introduced as an important disorder of cats by holzworth 1 and a clinico-pathologic conference on the disease was published the following year 2 the incidence of fip rose progressively over the next two decades the occurrence of fip among all cats seen at veterinary medical teaching hospitals in the usa from 19861995 was 1200 among new feline visits 1300 among total cat accessions and 1 of accessions at diagnostic laboratories 3 the incidence is several times higher among kittens and young cats originating from catteries or shelters the disease was thought to be viral when first described but no specific etiologic agent was identified at the time 4 zook et al 5 observed virus particles in the tissues of experimentally infected cats however the close similarities of fip virus fipv in tissues to members of the family coronaviridae was noted by ward 6 the ability of fipv to cause either a non-effusive dry parenchymatous or effusive wet non-parenchymatous form of the disease was first reported by montali and strandberg 7 the close genetic relationship of fipv to coronaviruses of dogs and swine was first recognized by pedersen et al 8 the existence of two serotypes feline- or canine-coronavirus like was described in 1984 9 fip was originally believed to be an uncommon clinical manifestation of a ubiquitous and largely nonpathogenic agent named feline enteric coronavirus fecv 10 subsequent studies demonstrated that the agent of fip was distinct from fecv in disease potential but that both viruses co-existed in the same population and were antigenically identical reviewed in 11 12 it was subsequently hypothesized that fipv might be a simple mutant of fecv 13 and the two viruses were later described as biotypes of each other 14 animal studies with both natural 15 and experimental 16 infection also suggest that fipvs arise spontaneously during the course of fecv infection vennema et al 17 demonstrated that all major structural and accessory genes of wild type fecvs were virtually identical to fipvs from the same or closely related cats however 85 of fipvs studied had deleterious mutations in a small accessory gene called 3c these mutations which were either deletions or introduced stop codons were also found to be unique to each cat in spite of indirect and direct supporting evidence for internal fecvfipv mutation the role of fecv mutation in fip and especially in the 3c gene has not been given much attention in the literature of fip reviewed 11 in fact there is a general feeling that fipv and fecv are either the same virus with disease being dependent on the nature of the hosts immune response reviewed 11 or that the causative mutation is in other genes 18 although the precise origin of fipvs is debated there appears to be agreement regarding the relative cell tropisms of fecvs and fipvs fecvs are thought to have greater tropism for the mature apical intestinal epithelium while fipvs are believed to have a greater tropism for macrophages reviewed 11 this has led to the a strongly held belief that coronaviruses found in the feces are fecv-like while viruses found in extra-intestinal usually lesional tissues are fipv-like 19 the purpose of this study was to repeat the original work of vennema et al 17 with a new and geographically diverse group of cats and to test the major tenant of the fecvfipv theory and three of its possible correlates the major tenant of the theory assumes that functional mutations in the 3c gene are somehow related to the fip biotype the first correlate of this theory supposes that each fip cat will have its own unique 3c mutant which is not transmitted cat-to-cat the second correlate assumes compartmentalization of enteric and fip biotypes to gut and internal tissues respectively the third correlate if correct should show fipvs to be as geographically diverse as the fecvs from which they arise complete structural s e m n and accessory 3ac and 7 a b gene sequences were obtained from diseased omentum of the four related cats that died of fip and the isolates designated were fipv-ucd11 12 13 and 14 table 1 the numbers of nucleotides sequenced for isolates fipv-ucd11 to ucd14 are shown in table 1 while the relationship of the fipvs isolated from the 4 related scottish fold cats is shown in figure 1 the overall sequence identity for the nine structural and accessory genes was  99 with only a small number of mutations among the four highly related viruses table 1 mutations consisted of minor snp changes and less commonly deletions that appeared to be randomly scattered among the genes that were sequenced about one half of the mutations resulted in amino acid changes table 2 among the 9 structural and accessory genes of the four related cats the highest genetic variability was in the 3c gene followed by the s and m genes table 2 the least variability was detected in the 3b 7a and 3a accessory genes among all of the genes sequenced only the 3c genes of the fipv isolates had snps that resulted in premature stop codons or deletions that caused frame shifts both resulting in a variable truncation of the 3c protein figure 2 the omentum viruses from red consisted of two distinct variants as determined by sequences obtained from multiple overlapping pcr products table 1 these variants were designated fipv-ucd11a and -ucd11b there were only five snps scattered across the nine structural and accessory genes between the two variants two variants were also sequenced from the omentum of toby one with a non-functional 3c gene fipv-ucd12 and one with a functional 3c gene fecv-ucd5 these two variants were identical in sequence except for a single-base deletion in the 3c of one of the variants fipv-ucd12 four additional unrelated cats 392312 384062 and 388210 from paradise menlo park and san jose ca respectively and cat-t from mountlake terrace wa were included in the study the three cats seen at the vmth suffered from the non-effusive form of fip while the washington state cat died of effusive fip the e m n 3ac and 7a b genes were amplified from the omentum or organ granulomas of all four animals viruses were readily detected in the diseased tissues of cats 388210 388406 cat-t and 392312 and designated fipv-ucd15 to ucd18 respectively table 1 fipv-ucd15a possessed a two-nucleotide deletion near the end of the 3c gene and a second deletion of 48-nucleotide involving the terminus of 3b and beginning of 3c figure 2 mutations of the 3c gene in fipv-ucd16 and -ucd17 involved premature stop codons two variants with six scattered snps and an identical deletion in the 3c genes were identified in organ granulomas of cat 392312 and designated fipv-ucd18a and -ucd18b table 1 all of the structural and accessory genes that were sequenced for the eight different fip cats appeared to be intact except for the 3c genes the 3c genes from all eight isolates contained deletions or snps that either produced truncating frame shifts or premature stop codons figure 2 the sequence relationship of the four unrelated fipv isolates to each other and to the fipv isolates from the four related scottish fold cats is shown in figure 1 the overall genetic similarity for the e m n and 3ac 7a b genes ranged from 8999 among the 8 fipv isolates the four fipvs from unrelated cats showed sequence identity of 8992 to each other and to the fipvs from the four related cats feces or colonic scrapings from the four related cats and a fifth unrelated housemate contained feline coronaviruses table 3 the amount of viral rna in feces in cats with fip was much lower than in diseased omentum and obtaining complete sequences of all 9 genes was not always possible therefore the actual genes sequenced for each fecal coronavirus isolate are shown in table 3 coronaviruses isolated from the feces of two cats tux and toby were 99 identical and contained identical 3c gene mutations to the omental viruses from the same cats the coronavirus isolated from lucys feces designated fecv-ucd3 had an intact ie wild type or non-deliterious 3c and its sequence was otherwise 99 identical to the sequence of fipv-ucd14 found in her diseased omentum the sequence obtained from the fecal virus of simba a housemate of lucy also had an intact 3c gene and was designated fecv-ucd4 fecv-ucd4 was most closely related to the fipv isolated from lucy and was 997 related to the consensus nucleotide sequences of coronaviruses obtained from the four related fip cats figure 1 table 2 a similar finding was found for the cats that were unrelated to those described above and that were from disparate geographic regions three of four fecal samples 388210 388406 and cat-t contained amplifiable rna and complete 3c genes were sequenced in 23 of these cats 388210 and 388406 the 3c gene sequence of the fecal virus of cat 388406 was intact and 99 related to the fipv found in diseased tissue table 2 this fecal isolate was designated fecv-ucd6 the 3c gene of 388210 fecal virus contained a deliterious two-nucleotide deletion near the end of the 3c gene and was designated fipv-ucd15b this same deletion was also detected in the lesional fipv-ucd15a however fipv-ucd15a did not contain the 48-nucleotide deletion involving 3b and 3c of fipv-ucd15b figure 2 only the 7a b genes were sequenced from the feces of cat-t and the sequence was 100 identical to the 7a b sequence from the omental fipv-ucd17 this study of lesional andor fecal coronaviruses from nine cats both supported and modified the previous conclusions of vennema et al 17 viruses from diseased tissues from all eight cats in this study had truncating mutations either in the form of deletions leading to frame shifts or coding changes causing premature stop codons in the 3c gene such damaging mutations were not present in other accessory and structural genes in this or in a previous study 17 as with the earlier study 17 all or almost all of the fecal isolates from diseased cats and a healthy contact control animal had intact 3c genes taken as a whole the present study supported a role for deleterious 3c gene mutations in the genesis of fipvs from fecvs however not all fipv isolates have deleterious 3c gene mutations although 88 100 of lesional isolates in the present study had functional mutations in their 3c genes only 1113 85 of the fipvs reported by vennema et al 17 had deliterious 3c gene mutations we have also recently observed what appeared to be intact 3c genes in 1231 random breed cats that were adopted from a large shelter in northern california and died of fip however several of these isolates contained mutated 3c genes as minor variants and without animal inoculation studies it is not possible to say whether or not these or the remaining isolates were capable of causing fip the existence of helperdefective virus replication in the latter situation also needs to be considered animal inoculation studies to determine the biotype of a given feline coronavirus are critical for determining the ultimate biotype of any isolate regardless of its sequence regularities or irregularities it was therefore important to demonstrate herein that an isolate from the four related cats reported herein was capable of causing fip since some fipvs appear to have intact 3c genes it may be premature to ascribe the fip biotype solely to deleterious mutations in the 3c gene however what are the alternatives it can be argued that mutations in the conserved replicasetranscriptase genes may have a similar effect that small mutations in other structural and accessory genes collectively or singly will have the same effect that fipv and fecv are identical viruses or that deleterious 3c gene mutations are an effect of the disease and not its cause involvement of the replicasetranscriptase genes is unlikely because the replicasetranscriptase region is highly conserved among feline coronaviruses and unlikely to be involved in cell tropism or evasion of the hosts immune response one study of a natural serotype i fipv isolate c1je showed a high degree of sequence conservation within the replicasetranscriptase genes compared to other feline coronaviruses while a premature stop codon limited the 3c gene product to the first 16 amino acids 19 it is also unlikely that mutations in other accessory or structural genes are involved even though such mutations have been frequently found in feline coronaviruses firstly 3c gene mutations in fipvs occur significantly out of proportion to mutations in other structural or accessory genes secondly there is little scientific evidence especially based on animal inoculation that other accessory genes are involved in fip in the original report that proposed the internal mutation theory 1113 of the fipvs had 3c mutations while 213 isolates had only 7b mutations 17 however both of the latter cats were related and had been experimentally infected with an identical fecv fecv-rm a third sibling cat from this group had the same 7b mutation but with a unique functional 3c mutation variants were not tested at the time and it is possible that 3c mutants would have been present if the two discordant isolates had been adequately sequenced earlier studies have also demonstrated an absence of 7b mutations in almost all fecvs and other fipvs and indicate that such mutations are most likely tissue culture artifacts 17 20 yet other studies suggest that 7a and 7b mutations occur in nature in both fip and enteric infections and are therefore not directly linked to pathogenicity 20 21 23 there is a general belief that host and environmental factors and not virus mutation are the basic determinants of whether a cat develops fip or just a mild enteritis following exposure to the common feline coronavirus 2428 for such a theory to be correct fecvs and fipvs would have to be identical in both genetic structure and virulence the evidence that fecvs and fipvs cause very different diseases is strong 1013 even though environmental and host factors are admittedly important in fip 29 30 lesional viruses from the eight fip cats in this study even though highly related to fecal isolates were easily differentiated from each other based on deliterious 3c gene mutations alone moreover an infectious inoculum made from the diseased omentum of one of the fip cats induced fip in 3 of 12 cats that were experimentally infected see section 22 confirmation of biotype by animal inoculation such as described herein is rarely done in published reports concerned with feline coronavirus infection reviewed in 11 the possibility that deleterious 3c gene mutations are an effect of the disease and not a cause also has to be considered however there is little precedence for this and given the ability of a lesional isolate from the present study to produce fip it is counterintuitive for a functional 3c gene mutant to be both a cause and effect of its own disease this theory would also not explain why all non-tissue culture adapted fecv strains used for experimental inoculation studies have intact 3c genes while all tissue culture adapted and non-adapted strains have mutated 3c genes 17 the existence of feline coronavirus variants was not a novel observation 23 31 32 but their frequency and fate has not been previously addressed variant forms were found in both extraintestinal tissues and feces of the 9 cats in this study but only one variant became predominant upon experimental passage from one cat to another see section 22 the infecting variant may have been merely the first virus into a macrophage or its selection may have involved more complex hostvirus interactions we also found that subtle and sometimes significant genetic mutations usually snps and deletions occurred upon primary replication in a new host therefore genetic variation among feline coronaviruses occurs both within and between host cats selective infection with a single variant can also rapidly lead to genetically distinct clades of coronavirus especially when combined with a high intrinsic and extrinsic mutation rate twelve laboratory cats were inoculated intraperitoneally with a cell-free inoculum prepared from the diseased omentum of red which contained two variant forms of the virus fipv-ucd11a and - ucd11b three of these cats developed effusive fip within 24 weeks viral rna was isolated from the omentum of each experimentally infected cat at the time of necropsy the s one cat and e m n and 3ac 7a b genes all three cats were sequenced one of the cats was found to be infected with fipv-ucd11a while two of the cats were each infected with fipv-ucd11b each of these cats had a nearly identical variant of ucd-11a or ucd-11b in its diseased omentum table 4 the premature stop codon of parental 3c gene was preserved in fipv isolates from all three cats however fipv-ucd11b 2 isolated from one of the three cats had acquired two additional large deletions affecting both the 3b and 3c genes that were not in the infecting virus table 4 and figure 2 it is important to determine by animal inoculation studies the true biotype of a feline coronavirus that is being reported rather than always referring to a generic feline coronavirus reviewed in 11 feline coronaviruses that possess the fip biotype such as fipv-ucd11ab will readily induce fip in from 25100 of infected individuals depending on the strain being tested reviewed in 11 however bonifed cat-to-cat passaged non-tissue culture adapted fecv strains will rarely induce fip in healthy cats 9 12 15 17 the present study adds to our knowledge of genetic drift among feline coronaviruses that inhabit the same cat multi-cat household cattery or geographically distant region all of the fipvs and fecvs isolated from the five cats that had close contact with each other in sonoma california were 99 related tables 1 and 3 figure 1 based on gene sequences and historical facts it can be reasonably concluded that cat simba was infected with an fecv following contact with cat lucy this supported another correlate of the internal mutation theory fecvs are easily spread cat-to-cat while fipvs are not addie et al 33 also noted that the same strain of coronavirus tended to persist among any given group of cats however coronaviruses within a closely housed group of cats and even within the same cat undergo continuous genetic drift we observed sequence differences of 12 or less in cats from the same group while genetic drift between cats from distant areas of the western us was on the order of 616 herewegh et al 34 also found that feline coronaviruses from individuals within the same environment had unique genetic fingerprints and fell within the same clade while geographically distant isolates belonged to genetically unique clades the notable mutational drift observed among feline coronaviruses across geographic regions in the face of genetic conservation within stable groups of cats is paradoxical however the evidence indicates that coronavirus infection in any group of cats originates from a single founder virus that virtually every cat in a group is infected rapidly and efficiently and that cats appear to resist superinfection with closely related strains 34 the single founder virus effect was confirmed in the present study table 4 thus marked genetic drift occurs when a single coronavirus strain is serially passed from one susceptible population to the next this scenario was supported by our animal transmission studies when cats were simultaneously infected with two closely related variants of fipv each variant segregated into different cats therefore minor mutants may become predominate when passed cat-to-cat the s sequences of fipv-ucd11 to 14 were compared to that of previously reported fipvs and to a purported fecv wsu-79-1683 data not shown the s protein shared 98 sequence identity among the four fipv isolates and 8791 sequence identity to other published serotype i fipvs however when compared to the s protein of serotype ii feline coronaviruses wsu-79-1146 and wsu-79-1683 there was only 4344 sequence identity data not shown based on the comparison of s proteins fipv-ucd11 to 14 were classified as serotype i feline coronaviruses however these studies demonstrate that serotype designation of feline coronaviruses can be more easily made from comparisons of the much smaller 3a rather than significantly larger s sequences 71 vs 1471 amino acids in the respective gene products figure 3 similar to the s protein comparison the 3a sequence of all four fipvs from the related cats shared 98100 sequence identity to each other and 8494 sequence identity to the four fipvs from unrelated cats and from published serotype i fipvs figure 3 however when compared to the 3a protein of serotype ii feline coronaviruses wsu-79-1146 and wsu-79-1683 or to 3a of canine coronavirus there was only 6570 sequence identity these results indicate all eight fipvs from this study clearly belonged to serotype i based on their 3a protein sequences while known serotype ii viruses and the canine coronavirus formed a separate group figure 3 fipv is unique from most other viruses because it is infrequently spread from animal-to-animal in a horizontal manner yet it is highly infectious when extracts of diseased tissues or fluids are inoculated into nave cats by a number of routes reviewed in 11 the general belief is that enteric biotypes are compartmentalized to the gut while fip biotypes are found only within internal organs 19 however viruses with 3c mutations identical to fipvs from lesional tissues were present in the feces of some cats in this study table 3 thus making horizontal transmission theoretically possible in certain circumstances there is also evidence that fipv may have been shed in urine of fipv infected cats 35 and that coronavirus may be present in the blood especially among younger cats 36 there are also several reports of fip outbreaks of sufficient magnitude and acuteness to suggest horizontal transmission reviewed in 11 while this study did not answer the question as to the relative importance of vertical and horizontal transmission it indicated the need to carefully study fecal and lesional virus isolates that are involved in explosive large scale epizootics of fip and not just the common enzootic form positive proof that the 3c protein is responsible for the fip phenotype in at least a proportion of cats dying of fip will require knowledge of its exact function of which we currently know very little a genblank blast search shows a 30 genetic homology between feline coronavirus 3c and sars coronavirus 3a data not shown moreover the 3c protein of feline coronavirus also has an identical hydrophillicity profile to its own m protein and to the m and 3a proteins of sars coronavirus 37 these similarities prompted oostra and colleagues 37 to state   it appears that all group 1 corona viruses expresss group-specific proteins predicted to be triple-spanning membrane proteins examples are the feline orf 3c protein and the hcov-nl63 orf 3a protein  despite the small amount of sequence homology among this protein the similarities in their hydropathy profiles both to each other and to the corresponding m proteins as well as to the sars-cob 3a protein are quite remarkable nothing is known about these proteins but it is clear that it will be interesting to learn more about their biological features a great deal of research has been reported and is being conducted on the sars coronavirus 3a gene and protein and it is evident that this gene and its product play an important role in viral assembly spread and pathogenesis as well as to protective immunity 3840 if the 3c protein of feline coronavirus truly has an analogous function to sars coronavirus 3a protein sars coronavirus research might be applicable to feline coronaviruses and how they cause disease the authors have used the original names of fecv to refer the enteric biotype of feline coronavirus and fipv for the fip biotype published non-tissue culture adapted coronavirus isolates from the feces of healthy cats always possess an intact or wildtype 3c while strains from fip diseased tissues have mutated 3c genes 17 therefore the designation of fecv or fipv in this study was applied to isolates with 3c genes that yielded either intact or truncated proteins respectively the generic term coronavirus or feline coronavirus was used herein when not referring to a specific biotype four scottish fold kittens were born into the same cattery in sonoma california red toby and lucy were from the same litter of three while tux was born a week later in a litter of three to a sister queen and the same tom simba an 11 year-old american curl was born in an unrelated cattery and resided in another sonoma household as a pet lucy was placed into this household with simba when she was 17 weeks old while red went to live in another home with two other older cats when at 14 weeks of age tux and toby remained in their home cattery with several other cats lucy tux red and toby first showed signs of indicative fip at 23 33 35 and 40 weeks of age and were euthanatized with confirmed disease at 27 37 39 and 41 weeks of age respectively all other contact cats have remained healthy to this time four additional cats were recruited from the western us two of them were 26- and 60-month old burmese 388406 and 392312 from paradise and menlo park ca respectively the third was a 16-month old birman 388210 from san jose ca and the fourth was a 2-year old sphinx cat-t from mountlake terrace wa courtesy dr tracy tomlinson full necropsies on all cats except cat-t were performed at the school of veterinary medicine teaching hospital vmth university of california davis ca cat-t was necropsied at a private veterinary diagnostic laboratory phoenix central laboratory everett wa a definitive diagnosis of fip was confirmed on all eight cats by gross and microscopic examination of tissues and immunohistochemistry the four related scottish folds and cat-t suffered from the effusive form of fip while the two burmese and one birman cats suffered from non-effusive fip samples of diseased omentum effusive fip or kidney granulomas non-effusive fip along with feces or colonic mucusmucosal scrapings from one cat were collected at the time of necropsy and stored at 20c feces from the healthy sentinel cat simba were also collected a cell free inoculum was made from the diseased omentum of red one of the four related cats omentum was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder the frozen omental powder was reconstituted in 025gml hbss hanks buffered saline solution and centrifuged twice at 2000  g for 30 minutes the supernatant was stored at 70c as viral stock the viral stock was diluted 13 with hbss when used as inoculum for the fipv transmission study adult specific pathogen free cats were obtained from the breeding colony of the feline health and pet care center school of veterinary medicine university of california davis ca a total of twelve cats were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 ml of cell free viral inoculum three cats developed fip within 2-4 weeks and complete necropsies

and 3 list the various fipv and fecv isolates that were studied and the genes that were sequenced for each these sequences have been deposited in the database of genbank the ubiquitous form of feline coronavirus is readily passed cat-to-cat by the fecal-oral route and is the cause of a mild or unapparent enteritis like coronaviruses in general feline enteric coronavirus fecv is undergoing constant mutation within its accessory and structural genes feline infectious peritonitis fip which is a highly fatal systemic disease is a sequel of fecv infection in a small proportion of cats the virus isolated from the diseased tissues of cats with fip is highly related to the fecv identified in the feces although snp and deletion mutations were common between isolates from the same cat only the 3c gene was rendered non functional by such mutations deleterious mutations in 3c tend to be found in diseased internal tissues while viruses with intact 3c are found mainly in the feces while deleterious mutations of the 3c gene were seen in all 8 fip cats in this study and in virtually all previously reported fipvs they are by no means a universal finding however there is compelling evidence that when they do occur they are the cause of fip and not an effect of the disease deleterious 3c gene mutants will readily cause fip when inoculated into laboratory cats whereas their largely non-pathogenic fecal counterparts with intact 3c genes are readily transmitted from one cat to another these gene 3c mutants when they occur are unique to each cat with fip indicating that they arise independently in each host and not by mutation in one cat with subsequent horizontal spread to others several minor variants can co-exist in both tissues and feces and when two variants are inoculated together into the same cat one or the other but not both will predominate the high mutability of feline coronaviruses leads to minor genetic differences between cats in one closely contained geographic area while significant genetic differences are seen between isolates from geographically disparate regions more in depth studies on the function of the feline coronavirus 3c gene

resident and adopted shelter cats niels pedersen c hongwei liu jennifer scarlett christian leutenegger m lyudmila golovko heather kennedy farina kamal mustaffa   the internal mutation theory on the pathogenesis of fip asserts that fipvs arise by mutation during infection with fecvs poland et al 1996 vennema et al 1998 although subsequently challenged dye and siddel 2007 brown et al 2009 the internal mutation theory has been validated by several recent studies chang et al 2010 chang et al 2011 pedersen et al 2009 fecv mutants that attain the fip biotype have gained tropism for macrophages reviewed pedersen 2009 this altered tropism allows the virus to stray from its normal host cell mature intestinal epithelium and become a systemic pathogen of macrophages a cell type that is at the core of both innate and adaptive immunity the type and strength of immune responses to this macrophage infection is thought to dictate whether or not a cat becomes diseased and if diseased the form it takes reviewed pedersen 2009 mutations that increase macrophage tropism were originally thought to reside solely in the 3c gene to work by altering the size of the gene product and to be unique to each cat dying of fip vennema et al 1998 pedersen et al 2009 the 3c is one of 11 genes in the feline coronavirus genome and it is uncertain whether it is an integral part of the virion and its exact function in the virus life-cycle it encodes a triple-spanning membrane protein that is similar in hydropathic profile but not sequence to the m protein oostra et al 2006 although the basic role of internal mutation endures the essential role of 3c mutations in the fecv to fipv conversion has been questioned it is now apparent that one-third or more of fipv isolates have 3c genes that are intact which is the case for all fecvs chang et al 2010 based on their findings chang and colleagues 2010 concluded that whereas an intact 3c is essential for intestinal replication functional mutations in 3c are not essential for increased macrophage tropism and fip however neither of these conclusions was tested by experimental cat inoculation studies rather the disease potential biotype of their coronavirus isolates was defined by their origins ie fecv if they were found in feces and fipvs if they were isolated from diseased tissues the implications of these findings go beyond the nature of the fipv mutations if fipvs with intact 3c can replicate in the intestine they may also transmit cat-to-cat this is counter to the current corollary that fipv is rarely if ever transmitted horizontally and that cats with fip are therefore not risks for other cats reviewed by pedersen 2009 pedersen et al 2009 the present research is an extension of the work of chang and colleagues 2010 in determining the role of 3c for intestinal replication of both fipvs and fecvs the fecv and fipv isolates used in this study were obtained from a large metropolitan shelter in san francisco that receives kittens and adult cats from the bay area the shelter staff educates owners about the health problems that may occur in their new pet with emphasis on serious diseases such as fip owners are also encouraged to seek veterinary care from the shelter staff or private veterinarians if fip or signs of fip occur as a result of these practices many of the fip cases among adoptees come to the attention of the shelter staff therefore this collaboration yielded a large number of both fipv and fecv isolates the e m 3ac genes were then sequenced and used to categorize the various isolates for their 3c gene status a subset of these genetically characterized isolates were then used to infect laboratory cats both oronasally and by the ip route to determine their disease potential and ability to replicate in the intestine additional studies were also conducted on isolates obtained after animal passage cats sampled in this study were from the san francisco society for the prevention of cruelty to animals sf spca shelter this shelter intakes approximately 3000 cats a year about 50 of which are kittens cats and kittens are obtained from a local animal control shelter from local citizens or from a number of regional orphan and abandoned kitten fosterrescue organizations older kittens are often taken directly into the shelter while kittens received at 45 weeks of age are immediately transferred to local volunteer foster caregivers foster caregivers house one to several litters of kittens at a time until they attain the necessary age and weight for spaying or castration 912 weeks and 0910 kg at which time they are returned to the sf spca shelter there is a biphasic peak in kitten numbers in the shelter with the first peak in spring a decrease in august and september and a second wave around october through december kitten numbers decrease to very low levels during the winter january to marchearly april this seasonal rush causes crowding at all levels of the kitten relinquishmentadoption cycle and the incidence of coronavirus infection correlates with population density ie low in winter and high in late spring and early summer forty adoptees were known to have died of fip between june and december 2008 and samples of diseased tissues were obtained at necropsy by either private veterinarians or the shelter veterinary staff samples from 32 of these cats were sequenced feces were collected when possible from the colon of fip affected cats at the time of necropsy diseased tissues and feces were frozen at 40 to 70 c until used fecal samples from 184 healthy cats usually kittens of neutering size and age were obtained from litter boxes from june to october 2009 forty five of these samples were tested and 31 69 found to be positive for coronavirus and 2731 were sequenced fecv and fipv are considered as biotypes of feline coronavirus fcov for the purpose of this study the original name fecv will be applied to coronavirus present in the feces of healthy cats pedersen et al 1981 and fipv to coronavirus present in diseased tissues or exudates of cats with necropsy confirmed fip ward 1970 alternatively the terms fcov or coronavirus will be used when the disease potential of a particular isolate has not yet been tested by cat infection or when speaking about both biotypes of feline coronavirus in a generic manner diseased tissue usually inflamed omentum or granulomatous lesions from kidney or mesenteric lymph nodes was harvested at necropsy from cats that had died of fip and stored at 70 c frozen tissue collected at necropsy was ground to a paste using sterile sand in a mortar and pestle the ground material was then suspended in 025 gml hbss mixed thoroughly by vortex and centrifuged for 20 min at 2000

 rectal temperatures were recorded starting one to two days prior to inoculation and at 12 day intervals thereafter cats were examined daily for signs of disease such as fever inappetence depression diarrhea dehydration ascites hyperbilirubinuria and jaundice once signs of fip became apparent usually 34 weeks after exposure affected cats were euthanized with an intravenous overdose of pentabarbitalphenytoin and necropsies were performed to confirm their fip status fecal samples were suspended with 5 volumes of phosphate buffered saline pbs by vortexing the suspension was centrifuged at 8667

 isolates from cats sfs-20 and -21 were identical thus yielding 18 unique mutations all these mutations involved the creation of premature stop codons 1018 or frame shifts 818 causing truncation of the 3c product almost all of these mutations were unique to the cat from which it was obtained fig 1 four of 19 of these tissue extracts also contained an intact 3c variant sfs-06 15 20 and 21 one of the 19fip isolates sfs-11 had a mutation that abolished the stopstart codon at the 3b3c junction and yielded an extended 3b protein and no 3c product fig 1 this isolate also had two deletion mutations in 3c fig 1 similar deletion mutations occurring downstream of a premature stop codon were also observed in three other fipv isolates sfs-03 14 and 23 one fipv isolate sfs-01 had a premature stop code in 3a while isolate sfs-18 had a 3-nucleotide deletion in the m gene fig 1 the remaining 1132 344 fip tissue isolates had intact 3c genes and normal sized transcripts for 3a b e and m no significant mutations in 3c other than amino acid substitutions were detected in 2627 fecv isolates an isolate from sfs-68 had a single histidine insertion at amino acid position 17 of the 3c protein fig 2
 virus was detected in the feces of two cats that died of fip the fecal virus from sfs-119 had the same 3c mutation as the tissue virus fecal and tissue isolates from cat sfs-05 had an identical intact 3c and the fecal virus fcov-2 was used for cat passage studies expt 2 table 4
 coronavirus isolates from the feces of 4 healthy shelter cats sfs-25 26 27 and 31 behaved as fecvs when inoculated oronasally into laboratory cats expt 1a table 4 isolates from sfs-27 and 31 were genetically different while isolates from sfs-25 and 26 were identical to each other but different from sfs-27 and 31 fig 3
 virus appeared in the feces within 24 days and was still being shed at 154 days post infection dpi expt 1a table 4 fig 4a only one fecv variant among three variants in the pooled inoculum was detected in the feces during this period this variant was traced to feces from cats sfs-2526 the coronavirus shed in feces from day 4 to 30 was 100 identical to the inoculated virus while the virus detected at day 154 had acquired 2 nucleotide nt substitutions c to a and a t to c changing threonine to asparagine and leucine to serine at amino acid positions 26 and 28 of the m protein the same inoculum was then given by the ip route expt 1b table 4 one out of 3 cats shed coronavirus in the feces and seroconverted this fecal virus was identical genetically to the virus detected in the feces of cats that were infected oronasally with the same inoculum this experiment confirmed that fecvs can infect the gut via the ip route but with some difficulty sixteen of 22 73 cats developed fip after being infected oronasally or ip with inocula containing intact 3c virus whether from naturally expt 3a or experimentally infected cases expts 4a6a table 4 cats infected oronasally with intact 3c virus shed coronavirus in the feces expts 5a 6a table 4 fig 4b although coronavirus was detected in feces after the first passage in laboratory cats the virus was not infectious upon further cat passage by either oronasal or ip routes expts 9a 10a table 4 coronavirus positive feces from one cat sfs-05 that died of naturally acquired fip was also not infectious when tested by the oronasal route expt 2 table 4 twenty nine of 37 78 cats developed fip following oronasal or ip infection with fip isolates possessing functional 3c mutations expts 3b8b table 4 fecal virus shedding was not detected in cats from these experiments with one exception the exception occurred among cats infected oronasally with inoculum m3c-1 in experiment 4b table 4 six out of six infected cats developed fip and shed virus in their feces an identical double deletion 3c mutant was isolated from tissues ddfipv-tissue and feces ddfipv-feces of all six cats this mutant which was not present at detectable levels in the m3c-1 inoculum was traced back to the diseased tissues of cat sfs-20 using ddfipv specific pcr tissue from sfs-20 was subsequently found to contain two variants one variant had an intact 3c and one had a double deletion mutation in 3c ddfipv ddfipv tissue caused fip in 77 cats by the ip route expt 7b table 4 and in none of two cats given the inoculum orally expt 8b table 4 no fecal shedding was detected when ddfipvtissue was the sole virus in the inoculum expt 8b table 4 the ddfipvfeces isolate did not cause fip in cats by either oral or ip routes but was briefly shed days 47 following oral infection expts 9b 10b table 4 it was replaced in the feces by fecv-1 sometime between dpi 7 and 30 as a result of an inadvertent exposure to a cat in expt 1b table 4 mutational events in the 3ac e and m genes of variants in the same tissue fipvs or fecal sample fecvs were compared table 5
 a greater proportion of fipv isolates contained mutations than fecv isolates 344 vs 111 respectively and the number of mutational events per isolate was also greater for fipv than fecv isolates table 5 the infectious inocula used in this study were made from diseased tissues pooled from several cats this was done for two reasons 1 to test the disease potential of a greater number of coronavirus isolates using fewer laboratory cats and 2 to study the relative infectivity of different strains care was taken that each mixture contained only variants with either intact 3c or mutated 3c following infection with a mixture of isolates only one or two strains were associated with disease and the infecting strains often varied from cat to cat among an experimental group fig 5
 the infecting strains were either identical to the strains found in the inoculum or a recombinant for example one of the infecting variants in cat-025 and cat-022 was a recombinant between two isolates that were present in the infecting material fig 5 the predominant infecting strain could also possess mutations not detected in the parent virus cat-007 016 025 026 027 fig 5a in one study expt 3b which used an inoculum m3c-1 made from diseased tissues of four cats and presumably contained four mutated 3c variants the infecting virus in five of six cats was a double 3c deletion mutant ddfipv not initially detected in the inoculum fig 5b this part of the study involved a more in depth comparison of 3ab e and m gene products of all fecv and fipv isolates fecv and fipv isolates from the shelter cats belonged solely to serotype 1 based on 3a sequence analysis pedersen et al 2009 unique mutations were found in genes other than 3c in a number of fecvs an identical mutation in 3a was detected in 1727 fecv isolates resulting in a truncated 3a protein with 62 amino acids see sfs-25 in fig 2 there were four fecv isolates sfs-33 31 39 and 68 that had deletion mutations in 3b resulting in truncation of its protein fig 2 one fecv isolate sfs-68 had a single amino acid deletion at amino acid position 53 in the e protein identical to that found in the four fipv isolates of clade i fig 2 fig 3 isolate sfs-31 had a 51nt deletion resulting in the loss of 17 amino acids starting at position 3 of the m protein fig 2 strain specific mutations were also found outside of 3c in cats with naturally occurring fip the four cats with fip sfs-08 10 16 and 46 making up clade i had an identical single amino acid deletion at position 53 of the e protein fig 1 fig 3 all but one sfs-13 of the fip tissue isolates making up clade iii contained a double amino acid insertion isoleucine-proline in 3c at positions 42 and 43 fig 6
 sfs-13 had a four amino acid deletion in the region where the isoleucine-proline insertion occurred an identical isoleucine-proline insertion in the same position was also present in the 3c of all fecv isolates from clade iv supporting the close genetic relationship of clades iii and iv two isolates had functional mutations causing a premature stop codon in 3a sf-01 and a 3nt deletion in m sfs-18 even though they had intact 3c genes the 3a b e and m amino acid sequences from the 32 fipvs were compared to those of 27 fecvs to examine whether a specific mutations in any of these proteins might differentiate fipvs from fecvs similar to the 3c product fig 6 a number of hypervariable regions were identified in the 3a b e and m proteins the same hypervariable regions were present in both fecvs and fipvs and no single amino acid changes or indels in these proteins were unique to either fecvs or fipvs non-synonymous amino acid changes were examined in 13 representative fecvs 8 from clade ii and 5 from clade iv and 13 fipvs with intact 3c genes 2 from clade i 5 from clade ii 6 from clade iii fig 6 the number and position of non-synonymous amino acid changes were nearly identical from position 1 to 140 however unique non-synonymous amino acid substitutions were more frequent in fipvs than fecvs from position 150 to the 3 end of the 3c protein 17 non-synonymous changes in fipvs vs 4 in the fecvs fig 6 the 3ac e and m sequences of isolates from lesional tissues of cats that died of fip during 2008 and from feces of healthy cats that were in the shelter in 2009 were used to construct a phylogenetic tree fig 3 four clades iiv of coronavirus were identified among this group of cats isolates within clades i and iii were 9899 identical to each other while all clade iv isolates were virtually identical 99100 clades i iii and iv were 9697 identical to each other while clade ii was 8794 identical to clades i iii and iv isolates from clade ii were much more diverse showing an overall identity of 8794 fig 3 this degree of relatedness is comparable to that encountered among isolates from geographically disparate regions of the us pedersen et al 2009 and suggests that strains within clade ii came from cats originating over a wide geographic area in contrast the close relatedness of coronavirus strains within clades i iii and especially iv indicated that each originated from a common source this common origin was supported by the presence of characteristic mutations in each of these three clades see section 35 cats infected with clades i and iii entered the shelter over a 6 month period in 2008 while clade iv isolates were collected over a 6 month period in 2009 again suggesting that these cats were infected from three different sources thirty two cats from a large regional shelter died of fip within several months of being adopted as pets forty percent of the fip isolates from these cats were found to have an intact 3c and 60 had deletion or stop codon resulted from nucleotide substitutions that yielded a truncated gene product this was in agreement with previous studies on fip isolates from the netherlands chang et al 2010 the remainder of this study was an extension of the experiments reported by chang et al 2010 on the role of the 3c gene except that the biotypes of coronavirus isolates from both healthy and fip diseased cats were confirmed by infection of laboratory cats animal inoculation studies confirmed the basic conclusions of chang et al 2010 but with some modifications their first conclusion was that an intact 3c was essential for intestinal replication indeed all fecvs studied had intact 3c genes and were infectious by the oronasal route and shed at high levels in the feces however one of three cats infected ip with fecvs did shed virus from the feces indicating that fecvs could reach the gut from the peritoneal cavity but with some difficulty therefore intestinal vs macrophage tropism of fecvs may be relative rather than absolute a second conclusion of chang et al 2010 was that mutations in 3c were not essential to cause fip indeed fipvs with intact and functionally mutated 3c genes were equally capable of causing fip when given by either oronasal or ip routes therefore truncating mutations of 3c were not essential in causing fip chang et al 2010 also predicted that fipvs with truncated 3c genes would not infect the intestine following oral infection and would not be shed in the feces although true for most isolates there was again one exception a 3c double deletion mutant ddfipv was shed from the gut following oral infection with the m3c-1 inoculum however a fecal extract from laboratory cats shedding this particular mutant was not infectious for laboratory cats by the oronasal route it is noteworthy that the original inoculum containing ddfipv also contained a variant with an intact 3c gene this variant was no longer detected in feces after passage in laboratory cats it is possible that ddfipv used this variant as a helper for intestinal replication during its initial passage in laboratory cats the fecal shedding of fipvs with intact 3c genes indicates the possibility of cat-to-cat horizontal transmission of fip the surprising finding in the present study was the lack of infectivity of coronaviruses that were shed in the feces of cats that were infected oronasally with fipvs possessing an intact 3c this lack of infectivity also applied to the novel double-deletion 3c mutant that appeared in the tissues and feces of cats infected with the m3c-1 inoculum and to a fecal virus from a cat with naturally acquired fip that possessed the same intact 3c as the lesional virus the reason for this lack of infectivity cannot be explained at this time but is another example of the complexities of fip pathogenesis however these findings support one corollary of the internal mutation theory ie cats with fip do not appear to effectively transmit fip horizontally to other cats pedersen 2009 it is generally assumed that fecvs are tropic for the mature intestinal epithelium while fipvs are tropic for macrophages this implies that fecv infection is entirely contained within the intestinal tract however several studies have shown that fecv infection has both an intestinal and a systemic phase and that the systemic phase involves monocyte-macrophages kipar et al 2010 vogel et al 2010 this again suggests that intestinal and monocyte-macrophage tropisms of fecvs and fipvs are relative and not absolute this would explain how fecv was able to reach the intestinal epithelium in one of three cats infected with fecv by the ip route if fecvs can replicate briefly in macrophagemonocytes then the mutational transformation of an fecv to an fipv may actually occur in monocyte-macrophages rather than intestinal epithelial cells such a scenario takes into account the high mutability of fecv and fipv both within and between cats pedersen et al 2009 the mutation rate may also be greater during replication in macrophages than intestinal epithelial cells as indicated by the present study high mutability would provide ample opportunity for positive selection for macrophage tropism the better and longer an fecv can survive in macrophages following primary or secondary infections the more adapted to macrophage growth it would become and the more virulent in terms of fip indeed stoddart and scott 1989 demonstrated that the ability of an fipv to replicate in macrophages increased with its virulence for cats mutational events snps insertions deletions in the present study were also found to be much more common in fipvs than fecvs both in natural and experimental infections indicating that fipvs are under much more mutational pressure than fecvs the role of antibodies in fipv infection and replication in macrophages needs to be considered as well the timing of acquisition of serum antibodies in experimental fipv either by passive or active immunization always coincides with the onset of disease pedersen and boyle 1980 antibodies greatly enhance the uptake and replication of coronavirus in macrophages and contribute to subsequent disease signs through an arthus type reaction jacobse-geels et al 1982 olsen et al 1992 pedersen and boyle 1980 pedersen 1986 weiss and scott 1981 fipv specific antibodies allow the mutant coronavirus an alternative pathway to enter macrophages ie by fc receptors therefore the fate of the host cat may be linked to its ability to contain primary fecv replication in monocyte-macrophages before antibodies appear in the present study as with other studies of experimental fip infection reviewed pedersen 2009 a proportion of cats appear to resist experimental fipv infection from the onset the importance of an intact immune system in this initial containment has been demonstrated in a previous study using fecv infection of aged fiv infected cats and their non-infected siblings poland et al 1996 there also appears to be a genetic component to fip susceptibility foley and pedersen 1996 
chang and colleagues 2010 concluded that mutations in genes other than 3c can also lead to the fipv biotype however they could find no evidence for such mutations a comparison 3ac e and m nucleotide and amino acid sequences of fecvs and fipvs in the present study also failed to find any consistent differences in the 3a 3b e and m gene sequences or products that would implicate these genes in fip one fipv isolate sfs-01 in the present study had a premature stop codon in the region overlapping 3a b another sfs-11 had a mutation that resulted in an extended 3b protein and no 3c product and two fipv isolates had 3 nt and 27 nt deletions in the m protein the 7a and 7b genes and their products were not studied herein because isolates of both fecvs and fipvs with significant mutations have been found to coexist in nature kennedy et al 2001 lin et al 2009 furthermore deletion of 7b causes fipvs to become avirulent herrewegh et al 1995 finally significant mutations in 7a and 7b were not observed in a previous comparison of fipvs and fecvs pedersen et al 2009 previous studies have also failed to implicate the spike s and nucleocapsid n genes in the fecv to fipv biotype conversion battilani et al 2010 vennema et al 1998 it is also possible that alternative fip causing mutations may exist in the first two open reading frames comprising the replicase genes which collectively make up more than two-thirds of the genome however the replicase tends to be highly conserved and mutations in these genes would be expected to inhibit virus replication and decrease virulence although a singular importance of 3c mutations in the evolution of fipvs has been questioned chang et al 2010 such a conclusion may be premature in light of what is now known about variants although 60 of fipvs have a functionally mutated 3c such mutants often coexist with intact 3c variants in the same lesions the opposite situation is also true in some cats the pressure to progressively truncate 3c is also evident upon experimental cat passage pedersen et al 2009 these observations suggest that mutations ultimately causing fip do not start with the acquisition of premature stop codons or frame shifting deletions and insertions that alter the size of the 3c product fipv causing isolates with intact 3c genes in the present study had four times more unique non-synonymous amino acid mutations in the 3 one-third of their 3c protein than fecvs although chang et al 2010 reported no differences between 3c of their fecvs and fipvs with intact 3c a comparison of their fecv and fipv 3c gene sequences obtained from genbank also showed a similar trend from amino acid positions 160 to 240 of the 3c protein the number of predicted non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in this region in 26 of their fecvs was 065isolate compared to 20isolate for 10 of their fipv isolates however these differences may reflect a higher replication rate in macrophages vs intestinal epithelial cells and play no role in fip virulence the ultimate answer as to the nature of fip causing mutations may require as suggested by chang et al 2011 the creation of infectious molecular clones of the basic feline enteric coronavirus by forward or reverse genetic manipulations site directed mutagenesis to mimic various genotypes and animal inoculation studies to confirm the resultant phenotype unfortunately a true fecv has not been adapted to cell culture and most fipvs also cannot be grown in vitro and the essential reagents are still missing phylogenetic data from the large regional shelter sampled in this study allowed at least three conclusions 1 feline coronavirus isolates within the shelter belonged to different genetically defined clades 2 clades differed genetically over time 3 certain groups of cats in the shelter were infected by genetically identical fcovs indicating a point source of infection occurring either prior to or during sheltering and 4 not all fip isolates could be traced back to the adopting shelter these observations highlight essential differences in the dynamics of coronavirus infection in shelters vs catteries or stable multi-cat environments catteries and stable multi-cat environments usually have one major enzootic strain of coronavirus that persists over long periods of time addie et al 2003 herrewegh et al 1997 pedersen et al 2009 poland et al 1996 vennema et al 1998 even in the face of exposure to other strains addie et al 2003 herrewegh et al 1997 most previous studies on the origin of fip viruses have involved catteries and multi-cat environments which explain why fip viruses have been genetically linked to enteric coronaviruses in the same environments hickman et al 1995 pedersen et al 2009 poland et al 1996 vennema et al 1998 a failure to understand the dynamics of coronavirus infection in stable vs unstable cat populations can lead to very different conclusions on the origins of fip causing coronaviruses brown and colleagues 2009 also did a genetic comparison of coronavirus isolates from 48 healthy and 8 fip affected cats from a comparable large regional shelter in the northeast of the united states they concluded that fip virus isolates were genetically distinguishable from enteric type coronaviruses in the shelter based on combinations of five specific amino acids at positions 108 120 138 163 and 199 in the m protein two of these sequences yival i or yiial ii were purportedly found in all cats with fip while isolates from healthy coronavirus infected cats were hiivi iii hiivl iv hvial v or yvval vi and uncommonly yival i in agreement with chang et al 2011 the present results confirmed that these particular amino acid sequences in m have no value in distinguishing fecvs from fipvs all but two of the 32 fipv and 27 fecv isolates in the present study had yivali in their m protein one fipv isolate sfs-50 had threonine t instead of alanine a at amino acid position 163 and one fecv sfs-39 had an isoleucine i instead of valine v at position 120 and a valine v instead of isoleucine i at position 138 an alternative explanation for the conclusion of brown et al 2009 was that fcov populations in a shelter are changing continually depending on the age of cats at the time of acquisition and their prior environmental exposure history in order to trace the origins of fip viruses in cats that have passed through shelters one must sample feces prior to the usual age of primary coronavirus infection 910 weeks of age pedersen et al 2008 and in subsequent exposure situations preceding the development of fip  reasoning of spike glycoproteins being more vulnerable to mutations among 158 coronavirus proteins from different species guang wu shaomin yan   with the occurrence of new cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the prognosis of a possible return of sars in the near future is coming true also hypothesis that the new sars cases could be somewhat different from the previous sars cases in possible mutated forms appears to be true accumulating evidence shows that there are mutations in the sars-related coronavirus sars-cov 1 2 which may lead to difficulties in diagnosis treatment and prevention the sars-cov is an enveloped rna virus naturally we would expect that the different components in human sars-cov would have different sensitivities to mutation therefore it would minimize the difficulties in identification of sars-cov and facilitate diagnosis treatment and prevention of sars if we could identify which component of human sars-cov is most subject to mutations doubtlessly we should not limit ourselves to sole sars-cov not only because many species carry coronaviruses 3 4 but also more importantly because the coronavirus from civets is likely to be the source of sars 5 among various components in coronavirus we are more interested in the proteins because over the last several years we have developed three models to analyze the protein primary structure for a review see 6 including the proteins from sars-cov 7 8 in general our first model can classify a protein into the randomly predictable and unpredictable portions and our findings demonstrate that the unpredictable portion is more sensitive to mutations than the predictable one thus we can find which protein is more vulnerable to mutations by comparing the unpredictable portion with the predictable one among proteins so far the envelope protein hemagglutinin-esterase precursor membrane glycoprotein nonstructural protein nucleocapsid protein spike glycoprotein replicase polyprotein and hypothetical proteins have been identified in coronavirus 912 these proteins have the following functions the hemagglutinin-esterase is the major receptor determinant binding to sialic acid-containing receptors on the host cell and penetrating of virus genome into host cell cytoplasm by fusion of virus and host cell membranes both the envelope and membrane glycoproteins are components of the viral envelope that play a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via its interactions with other viral proteins the nonstructural proteins mediate nuclear export of viral rnps and bind rna thereby inhibiting host mrna translation and regulating viral pre-mrna splicing and translation the nucleocapsid protein is the major structural component of virons that associates with genomic rna to form a helical nucleocapsid the replicase polyprotein is a multifunctional protein containing the activities necessary for the transcription of negative stranded rna leader rna subgenomic mrnas and progeny virion rna as well as proteinases responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein into functional products the spike glycoprotein is responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion 1321 currently the sequences of 158 coronavirus proteins from different species have been documented each protein must have its own specific sensitivity to mutations otherwise the proteins would have the same ratio of mutations per amino acid sequences however such an expectation has yet been found it is therefore important to define which protein is more sensitive to mutations than the others the aim of the present study is to discover which protein is more sensitive to mutations among 158 coronavirus proteins using the model developed by us over the last several years there are 39 arginines r and 96 serines s in spike glycoprotein from human sars-cov the random frequency of the amino-acid pair rs is 3 39125596125412542983 actually we find three rss in the spike glycoprotein so the type of rs is present and its frequency is 3 in such a case both the presence of type rs and its frequency are randomly predictable and the difference between actual and predicted values is 0 there are 84 alanines a in the spike glycoprotein from human sars-cov the frequency of random presence of aa is 6 84125583125412545555 in fact aa appears ten times thus the presence of type aa is randomly predictable but its frequency is randomly unpredictable and the difference between actual and predicted values is 4 there are 11 tryptophans w in the spike glycoprotein from human sars-cov the frequency of random presence of wr is 0 11125539125412540342 ie the type wr would not appear in the spike glycoprotein however wr appears once in reality so the presence of type wr is randomly unpredictable naturally its frequency is unpredictable too and the difference between actual and predicted values is 1 the frequency of random presence of rw is 0 39125511125412540342 ie the type rw would not appear in the spike glycoprotein which is true in the real situation this is the case that the absence of type rw with its frequency is randomly predictable and the difference between actual and predicted values is 0 there are 99 threonines t in the spike glycoprotein the frequency of random presence of rt is 3 39125599125412543076 ie there would be three rts in the spike glycoprotein however no rt is found therefore the absence of rt from the spike glycoprotein is randomly unpredictable naturally its frequency is unpredictable too and the difference between actual and predicted values is 3 with respect to actual and predicted values in a single protein the statistical inference is carried out as follows generally each of 20 kinds of amino acids has a chance of 120 p005 to repeat once and a type of amino-acid pair has the chance of 1400 p00025 to repeat once in case of the spike glycoprotein from human sars-cov there are 99 ts the most abundant amino acid and 11 ws the least abundant amino acid if the first amino acid is t then the chance of the second amino acid to be t is 981254 p0078005 if the first amino acid is w then the chance of the second amino acid to be w is 101254 p0008001 thus the chance of first tt is 991255981254 p00062001 and the chance of second tt is 971253961252 p00059001 if we consider the lowest occurring amino acids w the chance of first ww is 111255101254 p0000070001 and the chance of second ww is 9125381252 p0000050001 clearly the probability is less than 005 if the difference between actual and predicted values is equal to or larger than 1 with respect to the comparisons among proteins the statistical inference is conducted as follows all the data are examined by the kolmogorovsmirnov test to determine their distribution properties for normal distributions the data are presented as mean  sd for non-normal distributions the data are presented as median with interquartile range outliers are detected according to healys method 24 the one-way anova and the friedman anova rank tests are used for parametric and non-parametric tests respectively followed by comparison tests sigmastat for windows spss inc 19922003 is used to perform all the statistical tests and the p005 is considered statistically significant after such calculations the amino-acid pairs in a protein are classified into randomly predictable and unpredictable portions by comparing the percentages of predictable and unpredictable portions among different proteins we can find which protein has a larger unpredictable portion than others consequently this protein is more sensitive to mutations according to our previous studies 2532 figure 1 shows the predictable and unpredictable portions in coronavirus proteins this figure can be read as follows the length of each bar presents 100 which is located at both unpredictable and predictable sites separated by dotted line for example the unfilled bar in spike glycoprotein group presents the absent types which are composed of 1970 randomly predictable portion with interquartile range from 1667 to 2689 right panel and 8030 randomly unpredictable portion with interquartile range from 7311 to 8333 left panel the statistical inference in fig 1 as well as fig 2 is conducted by using the anova test to detect whether or not there is a difference among different proteins in a panel followed by a comparison test for example regarding the absent type in fig 1 at first we use the friedman anova rank test whether or not there is a difference among different protein groups taking three bars in fig 1 into account the spike glycoproteins have a larger unpredictable portion than others these results suggest that the spike glycoprotein is more sensitive to mutations than other coronavirus proteins although different proteins have different types of unpredictable absent amino-acid pairs some types are absent from all members of a group of proteins for example the amino-acid pair wi is absent from all 27 spike glycoproteins no matter which kind of species or strain table 1 thereafter we are particularly interested in the unpredictable portions left panel in fig 1 because they are not engineered by randomness as mentioned under materials and methods an unpredictable portion includes the unpredictable types and predictable types with unpredictable frequency which can be presented as the actual values either larger or smaller than its predicted values our previous studies reveal that the unpredictable types whose actual value is larger than its predicted value are highly likely to be targeted by mutations whereas the unpredictable types whose actual value is smaller than its predicted value are highly likely to be formed after mutations 2533 figure 2 illustrates the percentage of unpredictable types and frequencies with respect to whether the actual value is larger or smaller than its predicted value in coronavirus proteins technically fig 2 is a subset of fig 1 obtained by classifying the data in the left panel of fig 1 into two criteria ie the actual value is larger than the predicted value or vice versa in view of the unpredictable portion whose actual value is smaller than its predicted value left panel the spike glycoproteins have the largest percentages in both unpredictable type and frequency among different coronavirus proteins whereas in view of the unpredictable portion whose actual value is larger than its predicted value right panel the spike glucoprotein group reveals a larger percentage of unpredictable type accompanied by a smaller percentage of unpredictable frequency this means that the spike glycoprotein might have undergone more mutations in the past than others subsequently we are still more interested in the magnitude of difference between the actual and predicted values because our previous studies show that the larger the difference between actual and predicted values the bigger the potential towards future mutations 2533 figure 3 displays the magnitude of difference between actual and predicted values in coronavirus proteins it can be seen that the difference between actual and predicted values is larger in the spike glycoprotein group than in others this implies that the spike glycoproteins have a high potential for future mutations in addition the difference between the actual and predicted values can tell us which species is more subject to mutations if we arrange the number of amino-acid pairs with respect to the difference between the actual and predicted values in each group of proteins from different species figures 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 show the difference between the actual and predicted values in each group of proteins from different species the scale of the vertical axes in figs 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 is shown logarithmically in order to emphasize the amino-acid pairs with large differences between the actual and predicted values due to the limitation of the graphic software the filled forms are duplicated in one or two bars however the data used in these figures can be found in the supplementary material these figures can be understood as follows the bars at two extremes along the horizontal axis present the amino-acid pairs sensitive to mutations because our previous studies have shown that the larger the difference between actual and predicted values is the more sensitive to the mutations is 2533 by comparing the scales of horizontal axes from figs 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 we can see that the spike glycoproteins are more sensitive to mutations than other proteins because fig 9 has a largest scale for the horizontal axis still we can see which species is more sensitive to mutations in each figure for instance the human spike glycoprotein is more sensitive to mutation in fig 9
 without clearly identifying the source of sars-cov its fast-spreading process and its mutations the battle with sars is unlikely to be finished soon therefore sooner or later we would expect to see new mutated forms of sars-cov in such a case the determination of vulnerable proteins in sars-cov is important and pressing the coronaviruses exhibit considerable serologic and sequence variation with the most extreme variability being within s genes 3 variant spike glycoproteins 34 are now known to impact pathogenic outcome 15 3537 this study provides three lines of evidence that suggest that the spike glycoprotein is different from the others 1 the spike glycoprotein is more sensitive to mutations this is the current state of spike glycoprotein 2 the spike glycoprotein had experienced more mutations in the past this is the history of spike glycoprotein and 3 the spike glycoprotein has a bigger potential towards future mutations this is the future of spike glycoprotein with respect to the first line of evidence the argument is that the randomly unpredictable portion is larger in spike glycoproteins than in others fig 1 if we compare the unpredictable portion in spike glycoproteins with the proteins we have studied in the past columns i and ii in table 2 similar to the left panel in fig 1 we find that the unpredictable portion of the present types is statistically larger in spike glycoproteins than in others and statistically similar in the unpredictable portion of the present frequencies this suggests that the spike glycoprotein is not only more sensitive to mutations than other coronavirus proteins but also more sensitive than the proteins in table 2 with respect to the second line of evidence we find that the spike glycoprotein has a larger percentage of unpredictable types and frequencies whose actual values are smaller than the predicted values in fig 2 actually 172 mutations have currently been documented in coronavirus proteins of which 153 occur in spike glycoproteins this supports our argument that the spike glycoprotein has undergone more mutations in the past moreover if we look at the nine proteins which have been documented with more mutations column ix in table 2 we find that the percentage of unpredictable type in spike glycoproteins is statistically similar to the proteins in table 2 columns iii and iv in table 2 similar to right panel in fig 2 but the difference regarding the percentage of unpredictable frequencies is statistical significant this suggests that the intensity of mutations in spike glycoproteins is weaker than the first nine proteins listed in table 2 with respect to the third line of evidence we find that the difference between actual and predicted values in spike glycoproteins is larger than in others fig 3 comparison with the first nine proteins in table 2 columns v vi vii and viii in table 2 similar to fig 3 shows that the difference between actual and predicted values is statistically larger in spike glycoproteins regarding unpredictable types and is statistically smaller regarding unpredictable frequency this suggests that the spike glycoprotein still has more potential for mutations than the first nine proteins in table 2 for the species susceptibility the vulnerability of species depends on the number of amino-acid pairs with the largest difference between actual and predicted values figures 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 may at least partly highlight the species susceptibility for example why have so many mutations been found in the human spike glycoproteins although it is obvious that an individual protein is different from the other proteins of a genome our results quantitatively and systematically determine the difference between the spike and other proteins by comparing their predictable and unpredictable portions of amino-acid pairs one may argue that it is also known that spike proteins interact with the host the environment and the immune system and so their structure is particularly vulnerable to mutations both in the past and in the future and also regarding its specific phenotypic effects in the numerous interactions it is involved in however we would like to argue that the host the environment and the immune system are the external factors imposed on the spike proteins while the internal factor in the spike proteins which is particularly interesting to us is the structure that can be partially explained by our random approach in another study on the spike protein we specifically discussed the spike proteins from three human coronaviruses classified with our approach and gave predictions of possible and potential mutation forms regarding the spike protein structure 7 at this stage of study it is still difficult to define the reason and to give a biological explanation to the results that the absent types in the spike protein behave differently from and opposed to other proteins although we have discussed the biological explanation in the present types in rat monoamine oxidase b in the past 38 however it is certain that the randomly unpredictable absent types should be deliberately eliminated from a protein rather than being self-organized and self-empowered this is so because such an absence cannot be explained by randomness which suggests the least time- and energy-consuming in this study we do not consider the situation that individual variation within the other protein groups could not in specific cases lead to similar values as observed for specific spike proteins this is so because the individual variation within the other protein groups would lead to a mutated form of a protein while this study deals with proteins without mutations however a mutated form of protein may lead its predictable and unpredictable portions to shift to similar values as observed for specific spike proteins in the current form of this study we cannot make any solid prediction from the present analysis for the behavior of individual proteins but only observe an overall trend the medical implication is that the mutation sensibility in spike glycoprotein leads to the difficulties in producing vaccines that provide us with long-lasting protection against sars this finding can be correlated with hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from influenza a virus both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are surface proteins and subject to the pressure of the antibody and the selective pressure for the appearance of host cell variant with altered receptor binding specificity meanwhile the spike glycoprotein is responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion in this viewpoint the spike glyprotein is quite similar to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase the multiple sequence alignments are a phenomenological technique by comparing the similarity among proteins the phenomenological analogy can be classified into at least three types for the simplest example we compare the letters that construct a word to guess the meaning of the word another type of phenomenological analogy is equivalent in physical laws for example ficks law and kirchhoffs law are equivalent to the law of conservation the third type of phenomenological analogy is mathematically similar for example the transfer of energy mass heat and momentum can be described by using similar differential equations 39 40 in fact what the multiple sequence alignments are doing is language similarity on the other hand our approach is a mechanism-driven technique by calculating the randomly predictable and unpredictable portions in a protein our approach is not a phenomenological tool and is studying the internal power engineering the mutations multiple sequence alignments cannot predict the future while our approach can predict the likelihood of future mutations technically multiple sequence alignments need a large database for searching while our approach needs a few data but a large amount of calculations in general multiple sequence alignments are the first step for the understanding of proteins dna etc and science must advance to seek other new techniques for the understanding of proteins dna etc however our approach at this moment is only related to the primary structure therefore it cannot give information on loop regions as multiple sequence alignments also cannot with respect to the evolutionary pressure our approach is using the randomly unpredictable portion to account as we argue that the randomly unpredictable portion should be deliberately developed through the evolutionary process this is so because randomness suggests the least time- and energy-consuming to construct proteins in conclusion our results suggest that the spike glycoproteins are more vulnerable to mutations among coronavirus proteins however the chance of occurring of mutations would be less in spike glycoproteins than in highly-frequently-mutated proteins

dhar sandip bhattacharjee pritha bhattacharjee  background covid-19 is a disease with global public health emergency that have shook the world since its first detection in china in december 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic the lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known methods available data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using multiple sequence alignment and pair-wise sequence alignment leading to phylogenetic tree construction each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on non synonymous amino acid substitutions the fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the non synonymous changes at protein level separately and in combination all the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of taiwan mt192759 which is 100 identical with the ancestor sars-cov-2 sequences of wuhan nc 0455122 submitted on 5 th jan 2020 transition from c to t ct is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations at ga ta are the rarest ones found in countries with maximum fatality rate ie italy spain and sweden 20 non synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning orf1ab polyprotein surface glycoprotein nucleocapsid protein etc the functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body interpretation the fatality outcome depends on three important factors a number of mutation b rarity of the allelic variation and c functional consequence of the mutation at protein level the molecular divergence

public health emergency of global concern in wuhan china from the menace of covid-19 ncov-coronavirus also known as sars-cov-2 covid-19 is one of the seven pathogenic members of family coronaviridae other notable ones are severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov identified first in southern china november 2002  and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus mers-cov from saudi arabia 2012 less severe ones are hku1 nl63 oc-43 and 229e 1 the enveloped virus possesses crown-like spikes on their surface latin word corona ie crown and a rna genome single stranded

to world health organization who 80 covid infection are mild or asymptomatic 15 are severe infection while 5 are critical crude mortality ratio no of reported deaths divided by reported cases is between 3-4 the infection mortality rate the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infection will be lower than seasonal influenza 01 globally there are 668690 confirmed cases 31065 deaths and so far 143107 people recovered in 199 countries and territories 3 4 the most vulnerable group in corona epidemic is elderly malnourished hypertensive diabetic immune compromised cancer and cardiovascular patients as well as pregnant women despite wide spread covid-19 infection the numbers of fatally infected children cases are less reported so far possible mechanism might be an unknown protective interaction between immune system and respiratory pathway 5 covid-19 spreads through droplet infection and fomites from infected person during coughing and sneezing majority of symptoms are sore throat breathing difficulty and fever although gi and musculoskeletal system are also involved 67 clinical course is somehow showing a predictable pattern on around day five flu like symptom starts common are fever headache dry cough myalgia and back pain nausea without vomiting abdominal discomfort with some diarrhea loss of smell anorexia and fatigue around same time symptoms can worsen leading to shortness of breath due to bilateral viral pneumonia from direct viral damage to lung parenchyma around day10 cytokine storm kicks in subsequently acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi organ failure ensues this degradation usually happens in matter of hours hospitalized patients in moderate to severe cases usually come in hypoxic stage without dyspnea china reported 15 cardiac involvement and serious final outcome in most of the chest x-rays bilateral interstitial pneumonia or ground glass opacities are seen hypoxia mostly does not correlate well with the chest x-ray findings chest auscultations are not of great help blood reports show in the most cases wbc is low ie mostly lymphocytopenia low platelet count whereas pro-calcitonin are mostly normal most consistently crp and ferritin levels are elevated and similarly cpk d-dimer ldh alkphosast-alt levels are also high it has been seen a ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count greater than 35 may be the highest predictor of poor outcome an elevated level of il-6 is of grave concern of cytokine storm 89 among the four classified subfamilies  -and  -coronaviruses both were found in bats eg leafnose bats like hipposideros armige harbor  -coronavirus and  -coronavirus in hipposideros larvatus 10 while  -and  -coronavirus found in pigs and birds respectively 11 the genesis of  coronavirus cluster in afore mentioned bat species consisting of primeval and genetically independent types might took favour of hostpathogen interaction despite of wide geographical distribution 10 genomic characterization of sars-cov-2 reveals 96 identity to that of bat coronavirus whole genome 1 while 79 and 50 to that of sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 12 like other betacoronaviruses the genome of sars-cov-2 has a long orf1ab polyprotein at the 5 end followed by four major structural proteins including the spike like surface glycoprotein small envelope protein matrix protein and nucleocapsid protein 11 13 the spike s protein has two distinct functional domains termed s1 and s2 both of which are necessary for a coronavirus to successfully enter a cell it has been found that s protein of sars-cov-2 is 10-20 times more likely to bind to human ace2 than the s protein of the early 2000s sars-cov strain ace2 is essentially a carboxypeptidase which can remove carboxy-terminal of hydrophobic or basic amino acids the expression of ace2 is comparatively higher in mouth and tongue and is also normally expressed in human lower lungs on type-i and type-ii alveolar epithelial cells the heightened affinity for a prevalent cellular receptor may be a factor which increases a quick transmission of sars-cov-2 in the upper respiratory tract as an rna virus 2019-ncov has the inherent feature of a high mutation rate due to mutations and recombination effects different viral strains are originating with new characteristics however because of its genome encoded exonuclease the mutation rate might be somewhat lower than other rna viruses 12 14 in this study we comprehensively analyzed the whole genome sequence homology from the available patient data uploaded by affected countries in ncbi virus database identified the mutations developed by different strains from the ancestor strain and studied the impact of those mutations at functional level our endeavour was to categorize all the strains into major groups depending upon their lethal effect and mutations observed whole genomic data retrieval from the database retrieved the whole genome sequences from ncbi virus database specific input was sars-cov-2 during a period from jan 5 through march 24 2020 later submissions or the sequences with many undetermined nucleotides denoted as n were not considered 15 countries those had multiple entries highest number of entries with whole genome sequence were matched for identifying representative sequence to consider eg for usa out of 44 submitted complete genomic sequences the sequence with 29 submissions were of complete genomic sequence with 100 identity and thus one representative sequence was considered for the present study thus 13 complete whole genome sequences submitted by 13 different affected countries were taken into consideration figure 1 clustalw version 21 was employed to align multiple sequences representative of 13 countries with the purpose a to understand the similarity and variation in all genomic position b to establish the evolutionary relationship among the viral strains affecting the whole world and c finally to distinguish the ancestry of different viral strains using fasttree tool which is based on neighbour joining method pair-wise sequence alignment emboss-stretcher was used for whole genomic pair-wise alignment between the ancestor sars-cov-2 sequences of wuhan nc0455122 submitted on 5 th jan 2020 with all 13 sequences similar strategy was used for pair wise alignment between the genome sequences of sars-cov submitted by italy 2003 with the sars-cov-2 strain of italy 2020 all alignment results were thoroughly screened to find out the exact location of the mutations and the genetic variation affecting that position functional implications of each type of nucleotide variations were understood from the lods ratio and it is calculated by the formulae log e obsexp where obs is the observed frequency of a specific alteration in the genome and exp is the expected frequency of that specific alteration due to individual proportion of the nucleotides in the genome sequences to obtain the different protein sequences of the translated genome open reading frame was generated using orf finder six different orf were generated which covered the entire genome sequence our protein sequences were aligned with existing protein sequences of sars-cov-2 present in the ncbi virus database to check which orf corresponds to the which known protein the amino acid alterations were identified from the nucleotide information and were classified into synonymous s and non synonymous ns the functional impacts of all ns mutations at protein were analysed using different snp annotation tools ie sift snap polyphen2 and metasnp the fatality rate of a country was calculated considering the summation of total number of death and critical case and then dividing the same with total number of detected case fatality rate  total no of deaths  total no of severe cases total no of detected cases the fatality rates were matched against the rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the nonsynonymous changes at protein level all the 13 strains of 13 different geographical locations were categorized depending upon the no of mutations and type of mutations they had multiple sequence alignment of 13 whole genome sequences representative entries from 13 countries clearly showed extremely conserved sequence with only 35 mutations supplementary material 1 only viral genome sequence identified from taiwan entry does not show any mutation suggesting this is the ancestral genome sequence all the mutations of sars-cov-2 identified were reported in table 1  among all mutations a three nucleotide deletion from 21964-21966 position was observed only from mt012098 strain of india the phylogenetic tree analysis showed the proximity of the viral strains of different covid-19 affecting countries three distinct clusters have been found   all the mutations are screened depending upon their rarity to occur in this viral genome and at ga and ta are found to be very rare alterations with lod score value less than -05 where as ct is the most common alteration with lod score 181 variation analysis at protein level different protein sequences are obtained using orf finder and those sequences were matched with existing orf1ab polyprotein spike like surface glycoprotein nucleocapsid phosphoprotein etc to ensure prediction of in silico orf with corresponding sars-cov-2 protein next observed mutations were confirmed at amino acid level and identified a total of 20 nonsynonymous ns and 14 synonymous s mutations  table 2  the analysis with different snp annotation tools like sift 16 snap 17 polyphen2 18 metasnp 19 showed the functional impact of ns mutations at different level predicting either tolerance of the mutation or disease causing ability or executing risk or damage which altogether can infer the fatality rate the fatality rate of italy 1482 spain 1377 and sweden 920 were significantly higher where it was less than 4 in countries like nepal zero fatality finland 263 vietnam 201 usa 380 australia 091 and india 206 in case of japan brazil and china fatality rate was moderate ie approximately 4-8 figure 3 the number of mutations and presence of either of the very rare mutations or functionally important ns mutations or both are found to be strongly linked with the fatality rate table 3a-table 3c  it is extremely important to understand how the ancestral strain s leads to lethal strain l and other clusters observed according to phylogeny our analysis showed ancestral strain s give rise to an intermediate strain i with single very common mutation a transition from c to t from i three different strains originate ie a lethal strain l with additional mutations over i b extremely lethal strain e that contains very rare mutations and a c non lethal strain n that contains favourable mutations at surface glycoprotein which possibly inhibit the interaction of ace2 and favouring non-lethal outcome  figure 4  the current global pandemic of the novel coronavirus covid-19 created two epicenters first at hubei province in peoples republic of china and presently in europe sars-cov-2 like its close relatives sars-cov and mers-cov is also pathogenic but with a higher infectivity rate the increasing number of cases and wide spread disease raise grave concerns about the future trajectory of the pandemic and thus a better understanding regarding the molecular divergence of viral strains and pathogenesis is utmost important the present study attempted to categorize covid affected countries based on molecular pathogenesis three important factors were considered ie number of mutations during evolution rarity of the allelic substitution and functional alteration of the non-synonymous mutations we screened and compared extent of mutations observed in genome sequence of sars-cov-2 all reported genome sequences of 13 affected countries have been analyzed so far studies indicated that there are only two strains s possibly the ancestral one and l might be the lethal and more aggressive one the distinct clusters that we observed from our phylogenetic tree construction raise the assumption of existence of many more unknown strains figure 5 one interesting report substantiating our finding is from shenzhen which showed possible generation of new strain which neither belongs to s nor to l subtype 12 we evaluated the extent of molecular divergence by msa and pair-wise alignment and subsequently tried to decipher the protein alteration parallel to the mutations as a rna virus it was hypothesized that 2019-ncov mutate faster than dna virus 12 the genome-wide phylogenetic tree indicated that 2019-ncov was closest to sars-like coronavirus with 96 sequence similarity 2021 when we evaluated the sars-cov 2003 and sars-cov-2 2020 from italy sequence identity was 794 suggesting new mutations might be deleterious in later strain our first approach was to categorize the countries depending on number of mutations and type of mutation they had it was found that similar number of mutations does not correlate well with similar extent of fatality outcome example patients from australia japan and italy all show 3 mutations in the viral genome but australia has least fatality rate while italy has maximum again numbers of mutations are 5 in china 6 in india and 7 in both sweden and spain the observations mentioned above strongly indicate that not the total number of mutation but the nature of mutations finally guides the overall fatality outcome in the case of italy we found three deadly mutations in 2020 ie 2269 at very rare allele 11083 ga very rare allele and 26144 gt with high disease outcome but the wild counterpart of these found in 2003 did not lead to any fatality suggesting the significance of newly evolved mutations although 2269 at mutation does not alter amino acid a668a increasing number of evidences suggest that synonymous mutations could have effects on splicing transcription that ultimately alter the phenotype disrupting their silence 22 spain is also carrying a very rare allele transversion ta that occurs in orf1ab gene of virus orf1ab gene transcribes into a polyprotein and cleaving by protease 3clpro and papain-like protease plpro produces several non-structural proteins which are important for replication as well as virulence for coronavirus thus an alteration in this region might alter the virulence and associated fatality outcome we assume while some mutations are pathogenic some will be favorable and will undergo positive selection pressure herein we tried to elucidate the possible interaction between ace2 and spike glycoprotein it is well established that for virus entry spike glycoprotein s present on the cov can be a neutralization antibody and it binds to its receptor followed by membrane fusion it has been inferred that some favorable changes in viral glycoprotein may limit the increase of fatality this kind of favorable mutation was found in some strains of covid-19 from india australia and sweden detailed screening depicted that australian strain carry a rare allele transversion tg which results into a ns mutation s256r on surface glycoprotein s1 domain which may affect the binding of hace2 molecules thus these strains become non-lethal to human in this study only one tri-nucleotide deletion at s1 domain of surface glycoprotein has been found and that is found in indian strains along with a ns mutation r417i in the receptor binding domain rbd of s1 subunit that disfavor viral entry by inhibiting hace2 interaction on the other hand brazilian strain acquires four common allelic transitions of which only two non-synonymous mutations affect protein alteration surprisingly swedish strain carry both extreme lethal 2717 ga very rare allele leading to g818s at orf1ab polyprotein and also favorable mutations 23952 tg rare allele leading to f806c at surface glycoprotein and thus cumulatively lower the severity of the disease in summary the present study reveals that the fatality rate increases with not only the number of mutations but also depending on its allelic rarity as well as functional alteration of protein surface glycoprotein domain is very important for host-carrier interactions and hence the mutations affecting surface glycoprotein can be one of the important mechanisms which alter the viral entry and pathogenesis future studies may uncover more genetic information at the molecular level as well as structural levels of the proteins because without this knowledge itll be difficult to identify drug target and prepare vaccine we hope our work will help in that direction sb pb designed the study sb sd analyzed the data sb pb interpreted the data sb sd sbh searched

yamada xiao liu bo shou fang guo felicia tay p ding liu xiang robert geraghty j   interspecies adaptation replication and transmission in cells are essential steps for an animal virus to emerge successfully in a human population virus-cell and cellcell membrane fusion mediated by fusion proteins associated with viral envelope is crucial for the entry of enveloped viruses into cells and for rapid spread of infection to the neighboring cells this membrane fusion process may therefore be a limiting point for efficient adaptation and infection of an animal virus in cells from a different host species in this study we report that acquisition of the cellcell fusion activity by point mutations in the spike s protein of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv plays a critical role in adaptation andor selection of a variant that infects cultured cells coronavirus is a large family of enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that cause respiratory and intestinal infections in avian and mammalian species 1 ibv the prototype member of coronavirus causes highly contagious diseases in chicken and is a constant threat to the poultry industry coronavirus was traditionally considered to have narrow host specificities 2 however the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars a serious zoonotic transmission event caused by a novel coronavirus demonstrate that a certain coronvirus species may exhibit wider host specificities and suggests the possibility of cross-species transmission of animal coronaviruses to human 3 4 cross-species transmission was also observed in coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and human coronavirus oc43 57 these events highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms of interspecies adaptation and transmission of coronavirus the beaudette strain of ibv was previously adapted to embryonated chicken eggs this embryo-adapted ibv strain was subsequently adapted to cultured cells originated from chicken and monkey for example the virus was adapted by serial passages to primary chicken kidney ck cells 8 9 and the african green monkey kidney cell line vero cell 813 furthermore the vero-adapted ibv is able to infect cultured human and animal cell lines 14 15 in a previous report a total of 49 amino acid substitutions was found during adaptation of ibv from chicken embryo ep3 to vero cells p65 1012 among them 26 amino acid substitutions are in the s protein 10 in this study expression of s protein cloned from ibv strains ep3 ck passage 7 p7 and p65 of vero-adapted ibv showed induction of cellcell fusion by sck sp7 and sp65 constructs however no formation of syncytial cells was observed in cells expressing sep3 construction of chimeric s constructs and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified a leucine to phenylalanine substitution at the amino acid position 857 in the heptad repeat 1 region l857-f that confers the non-fusogenic s protein to fusogenic re-introduction of the f857-l mutation back to the genome of vero-adapted ibv p65 showed rescue of virus containing the f857-l mutation however compensatory mutations occurred in the s1 region that could rescue the cellcell fusion activity of s constructs carrying the f857-l mutation cells were maintained in dmem supplemented with 10 newborn calf serum the vero-adapted ibv and recombinant vacciniat7 virus was propagated and titrated on vero cells virus stocks were kept at 80c until use cell monolayers grown on 4 well slide chambers were infected with vacciniat7 virus for 1 hour followed by transfection of indicated plasmids using the effectene transfection kit qiagen at 12 hours post-transfection cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs supplemented with 10 normal goat serum fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde in pbs for 15 minutes and permeabilized with 02 triton x-100 immunofluorescent staining was performed by incubation of cells with rabbit anti-ibv s polyclonal antibodies and subsequently with fitc-conjugated anti-rabbit igg cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy and digital images were collected protein samples were prepared from cells harvested at 12 hours post-transfection separated by sds-page and transferred to pvdf membranes the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-ibv s polyclonal antibodies or mouse anti--tubulin monoclonal antibody sigma aldrich and subsequently with hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse igg dako polypeptides were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence ecl detection reagents amersham vero cells were transfected as described above and harvested at 12 hours post transfection cells were washed once with pbs resuspended in blocking buffer containing 20 fbs and 1 bsa in pbs and incubated on ice for 30 minutes subsequently cells were incubated with 01 saponin in facs washing buffer containing 25 fbs and 005 sodium azide in pbs for 10 minutes at room temperature when required immunofluorescent staining was carried out with 1100 diluted rabbit anti-ibv s polyclonal antibodies and 120 diluted fitc-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody dako after washing two times with the facs washing buffer cells were fixed with 1 ice cold paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry viral rna was extracted from the culture supernatants or infected cells using the rneasy mini kit qiagen according to the manufacturers instructions rt-pcr was performed using the expand reverse transcription and high fidelity pcr kits roche the pcr products were cloned into pcr-xl-topo vector invitrogen and sequenced by automated sequencing construction of the full-length ibv cdna clones from p65 of vero-adapted ibv was previously reported 16 17 the f857-l point mutation was introduced into the corresponding fragment using quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit stratagene and subsequently ligated into the full-length cdna clone the full-length transcripts were generated in vitro using the mmessage mmachine t7 kit ambion according to the manufacturers instructions with certain modifications briefly 30 l of transcription reaction with a 11 ratio of gtp to cap analog were sequentially incubated at 405c for 25 minutes 375c for 50 minutes 405c for 25 minutes and 375c for 20 minutes the transcripts were extracted with phenolchloroform vero cells were grown to 90 confluence trypsinized washed twice with cold pbs and resuspended in pbs rna transcripts were added to 400 l of vero cell suspension in an electroporation cuvette and one electrical pulse at 450 v 50 f was given using a bio-rad gene pulser ii electroporator the transfected vero cells were cultured overnight in 1 fbs-containing mem in a 60 mm dish or a six-well plate and further cultured in mem without fbs the s genes from different passages of the vero-adapted ibv strain and ck-adapted ibv were amplified and cloned into pkt0 vector 18 chimeric s constructs were made by overlapping pcr 19 point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the quikchange kit stratagene all constructs were confirmed by automated nucleotide sequencing acquisition of the cellcell fusion activity is essential for selection and adaptation of coronavirus ibv from chicken embryo to cultured cells 10 sequence comparison of two s protein constructs sep3 and sck cloned from ep3 and ck-adapted ibv strains respectively showed amino acid substitutions at 31 positions fig 1a the cellcell fusion activity of these two s constructs was analyzed by transfection into vero cells using the vacciniat7 recombinant virus system western blot analysis showed the presence of major forms of s protein including the 180-kda glycosylated s and 130-kda unglycosylated full-length s s and the cleaved s1 and s2 species s1s2 in cells expressing the two constructs fig 2a lanes 2 and 3 it was noted that the expression level of sck was higher than sep3 fig 2a as a negative control cells transfected with ibv n protein were included and the expressed n protein was detected by western blot with anti-n antibodies fig 2a lane 1 immunofluorescent staining of vero cells expressing sck clearly showed syncytia formation at 12 hours post-transfection fig 2b panel sck however in vero cells expressing sep3 no obvious syncytia was observed fig 2b panel sep3 in the negative control cells no fusion of the transfected cells was detected fig 2b panel n to investigate the possibility that intrinsic differences in cell surface translocation of the two s constructs may affect their cellcell fusion activity cell surface expression of the two proteins was analysed by flow cytometry after immunofluorescent staining with anti-s antiserum as shown in fig 2c 057 of nonpermeabilized panel a and 213 of permeabilized panel d cells expressing empty plasmid exhibited background staining under nonpermeabilizing conditions 19 247057 cells expressing sep3 panel b and 293 35057 cells expressing sck showed positive staining after permeabilizing with 01 saponin 1038 1251213 of cells expressing sep3 protein panel e and 1831 2044213 of cells expressing sck panel f showed positive staining these results confirm that the two s proteins could be translocated to the cell surface with a similar efficiency to map the amino acid mutations responsible for acquisition of the cellcell fusion activity of sck three chimeric constructs were first made construct ep3-ck1 was made by replacing the c-terminal 412 amino acid region of sep3 with the corresponding region from sck ep3-ck2 was made by replacing the c-terminal 280 amino acid region of sep3 with the corresponding region from sck and ck-ep3 was made by replacing the n-terminal 882 amino acid region of sep3 with the corresponding region from sck fig 3a western blot analysis of cells expressing these constructs detected the s1 and s2 species as well as the glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of the full-length s protein fig 3b lanes 35 immunofluorescent staining showed cellcell fusion and syncytia formation in cells expressing both ep3-ck1 and ck-ep3 fig 3c panels ep3-ck1 and ck-ep3 but not ep3-ck2 fig 3c panel ep3-ck2 the relative cellcell fusion activities of these s constructs were semi-quantitatively defined by comparing the average size of syncytia induced by different s constructs with the average size considered as 1 of cells expressing sep3 and are listed in the order from high to low as follows ck-ep3ck  ep3-ck1ep3  ep3-ck2 indicates the relative activity is within 1 fold higher and indicates more than 1 fold higher these results demonstrate that the region between amino acids 750 and 882 may determine the fusogenic difference between sep3 and sck examination of this region showed two amino acid substitutions from sep3 to sck ie n826 to s and l857 to f fig 1b to determine which amino acid substitution dictates the fusogenic change three mutant constructs were made constructs ck3s826-n and ckf857-l were made by mutation of the s826 and f857 residues in sck to n and l respectively fig 3a construct ep3l857-f was made by mutation of the l857 residue in sep3 to f fig 3a western blot analysis of cells expressing these constructs detected the s1 and s2 species as well as the full-length forms fig 3b lanes 68 immunofluorescent staining showed formation of syncytia in cells expressing cks826-n fig 3c panel cks826-n suggesting that mutation of s836 to n did not affect the cellcell activity of sck cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation were also observed in cells expressing ep3l857-f but not ckf857-l fig 3c panels ep3l857-f and ckf857-l demonstrating that the l857-f mutation introduced into sep3 renders the protein fusogenic in cultured cells on the other hand mutation of the f857 residue to l totally abolishes the fusion activity of sck fig 3c panel ckf867-l the relative cellcell fusion activities of these s constructs are cks826-nep3l857-fep3  ckf857-l these results confirm that sck gains the cellcell fusion activity by l857-f mutation in the heptad repeat 1 region of the protein the f857-l substitution was then introduced into the s constructs cloned from vero-adapted ibv p7 and p65 respectively generating sp7 and sp65 fig 3a expression of these constructs showed cellcell fusion and syncytia formation in cell expressing wild type sp7 and sp65 but not the mutant s proteins fig 3c panel p7 p7f857-l p65 and p65f857-l the expression levels of both f857-l mutants were lower than the wild type constructs but no significant difference in the s1s2 cleavage was observed fig 3b lane 912 the relative cellcell fusion activities of these s constructs are p65p7ep3  p7f857-l  p65f857-l these data indicate that s protein acquires its cellcell fusion activity by the l857-f mutation during adaptation to both ck and vero cells further mutations of the l857 residue to other amino acids based on sep3 were made as shown in fig 3a the l857 was mutated to y s e i and k respectively expression of these mutant constructs showed that mutations of l857 to y and s exhibited similar effect on cellcell fusion as the l857-f mutant cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation were observed in cells expressing these two mutants fig 3c however much less cellcell fusion and smaller-sized syncytia were observed in cells expressing l857-e l857-k and l857-i mutant constructs fig 3c the relative cellcell fusion activities of these s constructs are ep3l857-yep3l857-sep3l857-eep3l857-i  ep3l857-kep3 the f857-l mutation was then introduced back to the genome of vero-adapted ibv by using an infectious clone system based on p65 16 17 to test its influence on viral recovery and infectivity in vitro synthesized full-length transcripts derived from wild type ribv and mutant fl clones were introduced into vero cells by electroporation at 3 days post-electroporation syncytia formation was clearly observed in cells electroporated with wild type transcripts no apparent cpe was observed in cells electroporated with the mutant transcripts at this time point upon extension of the incubation time to 6 days smaller-sized syncytia appeared the recombinant wild type and mutant viruses p0 were recovered from the culture media at 3 and 6 days post-electroporation respectively and further propagated on vero cells for 5 passages total rna was extracted from the culture media of cells infected with each passage of the mutant virus and rt-pcr was carried out to amplify the s gene the rt-pcr products were cloned 10 bacterial clones were randomly chosen from p0 and the complete nucleotide sequence of the s gene was determined to confirm if the recovered virus maintains the f857-l substitution as shown in table 1 l857 was found in all 10 clones however only five clones had an identical sequence with the original mutant s gene type fl and additional mutations at other positions were found in the other five clones table 1 among them two clones contain a t773-s substitution flv1 one contains an i769-v substitution flv2 and two contain q523-l and i769-v substitutions flv3 table 1 these results demonstrate that the recovered fl mutant virus from p0 contains a mixed population of quasispecies to investigate which quasispecies would become dominant in the subsequent passages sequencing analysis of bacterial clones containing the pcr fragments from p1 p3 and p5 was performed in the four clones chosen from p1 a homogenous s gene with both q523-l and i769-v flv3 mutations was found table 1 subsequent sequencing of clones derived from p3 and p5 each showed that six out of 10 clones from p3 and two out of 10 clones from p5 are flv3 table 1 the dominant clones contain an additional proline to serine substitution at amino acid position 327 flv4 table 1 the recovered viruses were then plaque-purified compared to wild type ibv ribv showed similar growth kinetics in vero cells fig 4b but formed slighlty smaller plaques fig 4a with lower expression level of s protein fig 4c a total of 20 mutant viruses was plaque-purified from passages 3 and 5 and the s gene of all purified viruses was shown to share the same sequence as flv4 table 1 the flv4 mutant virus formed similar-sized plaques as ribv fig 4a with slightly lower expression of s protein fig 4c interestingly the mutant virus produced up to 10-fold higher titers of virus compared to ribv fig 4b the cellcell fusion activity of s proteins cloned from the mutant ibv construct fl and the four variants flv1 flv2 flv3 and flv4 was analyzed by expression in vero cells once again expression of these constructs led to the detection of s1 and s2 species as well as the full-length forms fig 5a higher levels of s protein were detected in cells expressing sflv3 and sflv4 comparing to cells expressing the other two s constructs fig 5a immunofluorescent staining showed the formation of giant syncytia in cells expressing sflv3 and sflv4 fig 5b panels sflv3 and sflv4 but much smaller syncytia were observed in cells expressing sflv2 fig 5b panel sflv2 no obvious cellcell fusion was observed in cells expressing sfl and sflv1 fig 5b panels sfl and sflv1 the relative cellcell fusion activities of these s constructs are flv4flv3flv2ep3  fl  flv1 these results confirm that acquisition of the cellcell fusion activity is an important step for adaptation of ibv in cultured cells since amino acid difference between sflv2 and sflv3 was only at the 523th residue the sflq523-l construct was also created and expressed the results showed that it displayed a similar cellcell fusion activity as flv2   fli769-v fig 5a lane 3 and fig 5b panel flq523-l interestingly when q523-l and i769-v mutations were separately introduced into sep3 both mutants showed a weak cellcell fusion activity in vero cells fig 5b panel ep3 ep3q523-l and ep3i769-v the relative cellcell fusion activities of these s constructs are flq523-l  flv2ep3q523-lep3i769-vep3 these results reveal that q523-l and i769-v substitutions are sufficient to compensate the inhibitory effect of f857-l reverse mutation in the fl construct vero-adapted ibv gradually increased its infectivity in vero cells by serial passages and a significant difference between p7 and p65 was observed 10 comparison of amino acid sequences between sp7 and sp65 revealed a single mutation at the amino acid position 405 g405-d in sp65 fig 1a to analyze the possibility that the enhanced infectivity of p65 virus is due to the enhanced cellcell fusion activity of the corresponding s protein sp7 and sp65 constructs were created and expressed in vero cells efficient induction of cellcell fusion was observed in cells transfected with both constructs fig 6a panels sp7 and sp65 and 6b lanes 3 and 4 comparatively significantly larger syncytia was observed in cells expressing sp65 construct than in cells expressing sp7 fig 6a demonstrating that the additional g405-d mutation in sp65 may enhance its cellcell fusion activity the g405-d mutation was then introduced into sep3 and sck and expressed fig 6a showing that introduction of g405-d mutation into sck drastically enhanced its cellcell fusion activity fig 6b interestingly introduction of the mutation into sep3 and expression of the construct in vero cells showed formation of small syncytial cells fig 6b the relative cellcell fusion activities of these s constructs are ckg405-dp65ckp7ep3g405-dep3 avian coronaviruses have been isolated from chicken turkey and pheasant and may exist in many other avian species 20 ibv is usually associated with respiratory disease in domestic fowl and was believed to have a limited host range chicken is the only natural host similarly coronaviruses originated from human and other animal species were considered to have narrow host specificities until the identification of sars-cov as the causative agent of sars outbreaks in 2003 the current model of animal origin of sars-cov highlights the importance of cross-species adaptation and transmission of animal coronaviruses to human cross-species transmission of virus infection has long been recognized as a way for the emergence of many zoonotic diseases the molecular basis for this phenomenon would lie on the rapid adaptation of certain viruses to a changing environment through selection of minor variants from quasispecies accumulation of mutations recombination between minor variants and reassortment of their genomes a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control these events would be essential for providing safeguards to limit the impact of these devastating diseases in this study we show that acquisition and enhancement of the cellcell fusion activity by amino acid substitutions in the s protein are critical for interspecies adaptation and infectivity of ibv to cultured cells data present clearly show that the l857-f mutation in the heptad repeat 1 region of s proteins derived from cell-culture-adapted ibv is important for adaptation of the virus to cell culture systems and an additional mutation in the s1 region g405-d could enhance this process as s protein carrying the l857-f mutation is able to induce cellcell fusion but losses the activity when f857 was mutated back to l it suggests that induction of cellcell fusion is an essential step in adaptationselection of ibv to cultured mammalian cells coronavirus s protein is the major determinant for viral entry and host specificity it is a class i fusion protein and mediates viral entry by specific binding of the s1 domain to a host cell receptor 2125 the cellular receptors for several coronaviruses have been identified including members of the cacinoembryonic antigen family of cell adhesion molecules as the receptor for mhv angiotensin converting enzyme ii for sars-cov and human coronavirus nl63 and aminopeptidase n for human coronavirus 229e and tgev 2630 to date the receptors for ibv has not been identified in its native or adapted host cells it is assumed that a mammalian counterpart on vero cells could be used as a receptor for ibv at low affinity and might have structural and functional similarities to the native receptor on chicken cells at the initial stages of the adaptation process a certain proportion of ep3 would weakly bind to this molecule and gains entry into the cells by endocytosis in addition binding of ibv to sialic acid was reported to be important for adaptation of the virus to human cells 31 32 the beaudette strain of ibv was also reported to have an additional binding activity to heparin-like structures 33 these additional binding activities may help to initiate infection and thus allow the virus to adapt to the new host receptor by mutation to uncoat the engulfed virion and to establish subsequent infection cycles as well as to spread infection to neighboring cells acquisition of virus-cellcellcell membrane fusion and enhancement of the cellcell fusion activity would be an essential step for successful selectionadaptation of virus to the new host cells membrane fusion mediated by coronavirus similar to other viruses is a multistep process it includes binding of the s protein to one or more receptors conformational changes of the protein to a fusion-active form and the actual fusion process the membrane-fusion activity of coronavirus s protein is mainly associated with domains in the s2 region of the protein 3438 in this study we demonstrate that l857-f substitution in the s2 region of the ibv s protein confers the s protein from non-fusogenic to fusogenic this mutation may affect one of these fusion steps and thus modify the fusion activity of s protein and syncytia formation at the same time the virus was successfully adapted to the cultured cells with enhanced infectivity confirming that acquisition of membrane fusion is an important step in selectionadaptation of ibv to cell culture and may also play a crucial role in cross-species adaptation and transmission of ibv in cultured cells further enhancement of the cellcell fusion activity of ibv s protein was achieved by a single amino acid substitution g405-d in p65 virus this mutation meanwhile enhances the infectivity of the virus in cultured cells the enhancement effect by mutations in the s1 region and its significance on viral infectivity was further demonstrated by cloning and expression of s gene derived from the ibv variants rescued from the full-length transcripts containing the f857-l mutation in variants flv3 and flv4 additional amino acid substitutions q523-l and i769-v greatly enhanced the cellcell fusion activity of the l857-containig s protein and the infectivity of the recovered virus the involvement of residues in the s1 region in the cellcell fusion activity of s protein was also demonstrated in other coronaviruses 25 these results illustrate the complexity of the fusion process and the involvement of multiple domains in the induction of membrane fusion it is worth mentioning that the cellcell fusion activity of various s constructs was approximated by the degree of cellcell fusion induced in cells overexpressing individual constructs in a previous report we showed nice correlation between the cellcell fusion activity of two s constructs and their expression levels in the cells 39 this correlation was also observed in this study with more wild type and mutant s constructs based on data generated from adaptation 10 and cellcell fusion studies presented here a model of two-step adaptation process is proposed fig 7 in this model the adaptation was divided into primary and secondary adaptation fig 7 early passages of vero-adapted ibv including p7 p12 p14 and p20 belong to the primarily adapted group fig 7 other cell culture-adapted strains including the ck-adapted and beaudette-us strains cac39114 and cac39300 8 9 and the vero-adapted strain aav98206 described by youn et al 13 also belong to this group fig 7 late passages of vero-adapted ibv including p36 p50 and p65 contain the additional g405-d amino acid substitution and belong to the secondarily adapted group fig 7 except in the cell culture-adapted ibv strains the l857 residue was found to be absolutely conserved in all coronaviruses sequenced so far as structural information for this ibv s protein is currently lacking 40 41 we are unclear the overall role of this residue on the formation and stability of the six-bundle structure of the protein further structural and functional studies are required to delineate the precise roles of this mutation in the fusion process mutation of this residue to either a ser or a tyr showed similar effect on the cellcell fusion activity of the s protein as a phe on the other hand when the residue was mutated to ile glu or lys a much lower cellcell fusion activity of the s protein was observed interestingly mutations in the s1 and some distant s2 regions could compensate the effect of f857-l mutation this may explain why s protein from several other coronaviruses such as mhv and human coronavirus could induce efficient virus-cellcellcell fusion although a conserved leu residue was found at the equivalent position 42 43 it is worth mentioning that the cellcell fusion activities of different s constructs were qualitatively and semi-quantitatively determined in cells overexpressing individual s constructs using the vacciniat7 expression system attempts to obtain more rigorous quantitative data were unsuccessful as shown in this study s protein is inefficiently translocated to the cell surface probably due to the presence of an er retention signal 44 since cell surface expression of s protein is a prerequisite for the induction of cellcell fusion disruption of the er-retention signal may facilitate cell surface expression as well as quantitative analysis of the cellcell fusion activity of the protein as virus-cellcellcell fusion is essential for efficient propagation of viral infection attempts to interfere this process with fusion inhibitors such as peptides or small molecules are being made for several viruses including hiv sars-cov and influenza virus the involvement of multiple domains in the induction of cellcell fusion demonstrated here would complicate the design of such inhibitors furthermore mutations in regions beyond the target sequence in the case of coronaviruses the s1 and some distant s2 regions may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains understanding of the fusion mechanisms in more detail would therefore help design more efficient inhibitors  covid-19 variants database a repository for human sars-cov- 2 polymorphism data allah rakha haroon 2  rasheed zunaira batool javed akram atif 1 adnan jiang du atif adnan  covid-19 is a newly communicable disease with a catastrophe outbreak that affects all over the world we retrieved about 8781 nucleotide fragments and complete genomes of sars-cov-2 reported from sixty-four countries the cov-2 reference genome was obtained from the national genomics data center ngdc gisaid and ncbi genbank all the sequences were aligned against reference genomes using clustal omega and variants were called using in-house built python script we intend to establish a user-friendly online resource to visualize the variants in the viral genome along with the primer infopedia after analyzing and filtering the data globally it was made available to the public the detail of data available to the public includes mutations from 5688 sars-cov-2 sequences curated from 91 regions this database incorporated 39920 mutations over 3990 unique positions according to the translational impact these mutations include 11829 synonymous mutations including 681 synonymous frameshifts and 21701 nonsynonymous mutations including 10 nonsynonymous frameshifts development of sars-cov-2 mutation genome browsers is a fundamental step obliging towards the virus surveillance viral detection and development of vaccine and therapeutic drugs the sars-cov-2 mutation browser is available at httpcovid-19dnageographycom  the novel seventh strain of coronaviridae associated with sever human to human transmission tentatively named 2019-ncov that was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who on january 31 2020 1  later on the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses announced the name sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 on 11 february 2020 moreover on the same day the world health organization declared it a pandemic disease caused by the virus was covid-19 2 3  the number of people infected with coronavirus 19 will soon touch the five million mark in 209 countries including pakistan the first two cases of covid-19 have been reported in karachi and islamabad by the ministry of health 4  although covid-19 is most prevalent in pakistan as compare to other south east asian countries 5  to date 27 th may 2940406 active cases 357894 616 deceased and 2514950 4326 recovered has been reported worldwide 6  the sars-cov-2 is the 3 rd most highly virulent strain of coronavirus that causes severe respiratory disease followed by sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus with highest fatality rate 7 8 while other members of this family 229e oc43 nl63 hku1 primarily involve in mild selflimiting disease such as common cold in the human population 9  the first sars-cov-2 genome was sequenced and submitted to the ncvbi genbank nc-045512 on 12 january 2020 that consists of 29903bp with close resemblance of sars-cov coronavirus recognized as highly evolving viruses consists of non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded rna with a high frequency of mutation and genomic recombination 10 11  the virus genome is arranged in the order of 5utr untranslated region orf1ab open reading frame 3utr and nonstructural orfs orf1ab encodes replicase polyprotein pp1a and pp1b proteolytic cleavage of these two viral polyproteins produced 16nsp nonstructural proteins -club shaped structural glycoprotein spikess that gives the virus crown-like appearance-envelope proteine -membrane proteinm -nucleocapsid protein n 12  the study on the hotspot of differences in the genome of sars-cov-2 is very important for investigating the etiology epidemiology prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection we aim to develop the sars-cov-2 mutation browser v-13 that retrieved the full-length viral genome sequence data from national center for biotechnology information ncbi global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid and ngdc databases from all over the world to find the mutation or polymorphism in sars-cov-2 viral genome this mutation browser will help the scientists and researchers to investigate the variation in the whole genome of sars-cov-2 based on these findings biomedical companies are also trying to develop rapid molecular diagnostic kits vaccines and therapeutic drugs for sars-cov-2 patients numbers of isolates with a certain number of mutations are also displayed in the browser and are given in table 1 the evolution rate of coronavirus could be 10 -4 substitute per bp per year as a typical rna virus therefore the mutation could be occurring during each replication cycle 9  however in the present bio-information browser 5688 sars-cov-2 viral sequences from ninety-one regions were examined and a total of 39920 mutations were found importantly the database showed position and type of mutation consequence and consequence type in the sars-cov-2 genome therefore to avoid false-negative results data from this database will be helpful to design the pcr primers and probes with maximum specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of covid-19 a potential limitation of this mutation browser is that since all sars-cov-2 genome sequences used in this study were retrieved from different databases and the accuracy of these genome sequences could not be verified although these partial or complete sequences have been published worldwide in conclusion the covid-19 mutation browser is a worthful addition to the currently available coronavirus resources that will allow the researchers to access data expeditiously and intuitively on sars-cov-2 mutation we expect the sars-cov-2 mutation browser will assist the process of study design and be a key resource for the covid-19 community study design a total of 12743 high coverage complete genomes of sars cov-2 isolates from 77 countries 105 regions were retrieved from gisaidorg 16  complete detail about the origin of each sequence is given in supplementary table 1  the reference genome sequence of the virus was also retrieved from ncbi-genbank genbank mn9089473 17 18  all of these viral genome sequences were aligned with reference sequence in different sets by using clustal omega server provided by embl-ebi 19 20  the aligned sequences were processed by an in-house python script to extract mutations and filter sequences based on a filter over the number of differences only high-quality sequences with a max of 20 differences were selected for the database our python script could only call all the variants except deletions at terminal regions of aligned sequences and where nucleotide changes to n unknown nucleotide this script was also programmed to select and curate mutations only from those sequences having the utmost 20 mutations and no addition greater than two base pairs all the nucleotide variations were also annotated for their translational consequences along with consequence types for achieving this milestone an in-house built database was generated having the annotations of each known consequence permutation and then a python script was written to annotate each mutation and curate its consequence and consequence type the sars-cov-2 mutation browser v13 has been generated the viral genome sequences data with different types of mutations two viral genome sequences of pakistani isolates retrieved from ncbi were also processed through the same procedure and are provided separately on the browser this browser is coded using modern programming languages including html5 javascript jquery php and equipped with mysql server for rapid retrieval of information this browser is designed to provide the user with visualizations of region-wise differences gene wise differences hotspot of differences in genome consensus sequence and all differences of a sample from reference genomes and their consequence along with summarized information represented in tabulated format this portal is also coded to show some basic stats of isolates regarding several mutations and genomic positions concerning the number of mutations with the integration of google charts all the primers reported for sars-cov-2 diagnostics and research purposes were manually curated from literature and websites all these primers were aligned to the reference sequence using the ncbi blast tool to select fully reference mapping primers and curate them with their regions according to the reference sequence mutations database and primers database were then integrated into another primer infopedia tool that is also a part of sars-cov-2 mutation browser v13  an update on feline infectious peritonitis virology and immunopathogenesis niels pedersen c   feline infectious peritonitis fip continues to be a major killer of young cats and is one of the most researched infections of the species over 100 published articles concerning fip have appeared in the worlds literature since the last extensive review of the disease pedersen 2009 many of these and earlier publications have been covered in excellent clinical addie et al 2009 drechsler et al 2011 and scientific myrrha et al 2011 kipar meli 2014 reviews the goal of the present review is not to retrace old tracks but rather to present old and new discoveries on fip in a different light fip is a relatively new disease of cats and only became clinically significant in the late 1950s pedersen 2009 it is uncertain where the first fip virus fipv came from but one possibility is that feline coronaviruses originated within the century from another host species alternatively it is possible that contemporary feline coronaviruses are genetic variants of a preexisting and somewhat different virus species that was less prone to undergo biotype conversion both scenarios are known to occur with coronaviruses the intestinal form of coronavirus in pigs has been replaced worldwide by a much less pathogenic pneumotropic strain rasschaert et al 1990 while several coronaviruses have entered human beings from other mammalian hosts chan et al 2013 we also cannot discount the important changes that occurred in the status and husbandry of cats in the period after world war ii and how they affect fip incidence cats have grown steadily in numbers as pets and pedigreed cats and catteries have increased greatly in popularity the post-war urban and suburban sprawl has greatly increased the numbers of feral and semi-feral community cats and resulted in large numbers of kittens and cats coming into shelters and other fosterrescue organizations an increasing proportion of our pet cats now come from these types of multi-cat environments which can be stressful and favor fecaloral transmission at a very young age it should not be surprising that coronaviruses are now the most common pathogen identified in the feces of cats sabshin et al 2012 coronaviruses have adapted themselves over thousands of years to virtually every species of mammals and birds and are a common cause of transient enteritis and respiratory disease prior to the last decade research interest in coronaviruses as pathogens has largely been limited to poultry pigs cattle and cats hagemeijer et al 2012 however with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers interest in coronaviruses as pathogens has dramatically increased along with levels of research funding there are commonalities between what has been learned with animal coronaviruses and these emerging and sometimes fatal human viruses they are continuously adapting themselves to new hosts they readily recombine with closely related species to form new viruses and they even change cell tropisms and virulence within the same host although there is still no cure or sure prevention for fip a great deal has been learned about the disease in the last 5 years the internal mutation theory whereby a ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus fecv mutates into a fipv has been reconfirmed and at least three specific mutations have now been associated with the fecv-to-fipv biotype conversion much more is known about the interaction of enteric and fip biotypes with their specific and very different host cells and the radically different host response and clinical outcomes they provoke a number of new reagents have been developed allowing researchers to better understand these two biotypes and their diseases and hopefully more are forthcoming nevertheless fip remains one of the most complex of all viral infections of cats it is not possible to understand the interrelationship of fecvs and fipvs without understanding how enveloped positive single-stranded rna viruses replicate hagemeijer et al 2012 the genome of feline coronaviruses consists of  29000 nucleotides and 11 open reading frames orfs encoding structural non-structural and accessory genes coronaviruses attach to specific cell receptors through a complimentary ligand on the spike or surface s protein once attachment occurs fusion with the cell membrane is dependent on a separate fusion domain and a fusion peptide comprising two heptad repeat regions hr1 and hr2 the virus is then internalized and the single positive strand of rna is released into the cytosol the 5 two thirds of the feline coronavirus genome consists of two orfs orf 1a and orf 1b ribosomes initiate translation at the beginning of orf 1a and a proportion undergo frame shifting at the junction of orf 1a and 1b resulting in polyprotein pp1ab ribosomes that do not frame shift produce polyprotein pp1a these polyproteins consist of approximately 16 non-structural proteins involved in proteolytic processing genome replication and subgenomic mrna synthesis the non-structural proteins of feline coronaviruses interact with components of the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus to produce a replicationtranscription complex a rna-dependent rna polymerase makes negative sense copies of the genome as well as subgenomic rnas which in turn serve as templates for the production of positive strand mrnas only positive-stranded rnas are capped and polyadenylated the 3 polyadenylation and 5 cap structures mimic those of cellular mrnas enabling the virus to use the cells own machinery for viral protein synthesis the nucleocapsid n protein plays an essential role in viral rna and protein synthesis and virion assembly verheije et al 2010 viruses undergoing assembly make their way to the cell surface within membrane structures where they are released by exocytosis as mature virions almazn et al 2004 in the process of maturation the viral envelope also incorporates proteins acquired from various cell compartments these added host constituents might aid survival in the face of host defenses this strategy to produce viral proteins from nested subgenomic mrnas is highly efficient however like any process involving rna polymerases an error rate in the order of 110000 nucleotides is expected to minimize errors the large genome encodes a number of non-structural proteins that ensure a higher fidelity of replication hagemeijer et al 2012 nonetheless mutations do occur with some frequency chang et al 2012 compared whole virus sequencing of 11 fipv-fecv pairs and observed substitutions in at least 2963 nucleotides representing 10 of the genome of these 2963 nucleotides 1187 occurred in orf 1ab 1246 in orf s encoding the s glycoprotein 248 in orf 3abc 22 in orf e encoding the small envelope protein 42 in orf m encoding the integral membrane protein 113 in orf n encoding the n protein and 106 in orf 7ab other types of mutations leading to insertions deletions and premature stop codons as well as recombinants have also been observed in vivo both within and between hosts pedersen et al 2009 pedersen et al 2012 
phillips et al 2013 studied the mutation rate of fipv strain wsu-79-1146 in vitro after 1 8 and 50 passages followed by whole viral genome sequencing at each passage level they observed 21 predicted amino acid changes in orf 1a1b during this period in culture one predicted change in the s protein which reverted back after additional passages four changes in orf 3c and one each in orfs 3a m n and 7a and calculated the mutation rate to be 56  106 nucleotidessitepassage this suggested that the genome was relatively stable in vitro and in the absence of host and environmental selection pressures feline coronavirus mutations that do not have a negative impact on survival accumulate with time and can become dominant within micro- and macro-environments such as catteries and geographically distinct regions pedersen et al 2009 such mutations can be used to track a specific coronavirus back to its most likely origin recombination also adds to genetic variation between coronaviruses and is common within clades within the same cat and between cats pedersen et al 2009 pedersen et al 2012 recombination can even occur between related coronaviruses from different animal species the type serotype ii feline coronaviruses are an example of cross-species recombination that has occurred between the s gene region of type i feline coronaviruses and canine coronavirus the proportion of types i and ii fecvs and therefore types i and ii fipvs varies across the world although type i strains predominate duarte et al 2009 studied the distribution of types i and ii fipvs in a portuguese cat population using a reverse transcriptase rt-pcr assay that amplified the 3 end of the genome encompassing the region of felinecanine coronavirus s gene recombination in cats with fip type i coronavirus was present in 79 and type ii coronavirus in 35 whereas the remaining 175 could not be typed these viral sequences were further analyzed using a heteroduplex mobility assay which detected quasi-species in 17 of samples phylogenetic analysis of type i sequences revealed high genetic diversity among portuguese and previously characterized strains while the tree for type ii strains had higher genetic homogeneity than the tree for type i strains duarte et al 2009 there is a general consensus that fipvs arise by internal mutation from fecvs in the same environment pedersen et al 2009 pedersen et al 2012 harley et al 2013 except in unusual circumstances wang et al 2013 the causative mutations occur independently within each cat and each fipv strain has unique genetic features pedersen et al 2009 pedersen et al 2012 chang et al 2012 barker et al 2013 licitra et al 2013 currently three different genes have been associated with the fecv-to-fipv mutation or biotype conversion each mutation is a result of positive selection pressures initially for a switch from enterocyte to monocytemacrophage tropism then ultimately for infection replication and survival in peritoneal macrophages in the face of host immunity the orf 3c accessory gene was the first gene to be implicated in fecv-to-fipv conversion vennema et al 1998 and these findings have been corroborated in subsequent studies poland et al 1996 chang et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 two thirds or more of fipvs have orf 3c mutations that lead to a truncated protein product ie nucleotide deletions and insertions leading to frame shifting and single nucleotide polymorphisms causing premature stop codons pedersen et al 2009 chang et al 2012 hsieh et al 2013 the one third that do not have truncating mutations have an increased number of nucleotide changes leading to an accumulation of non-synonymous amino acid changes in the 3 terminus of the gene pedersen et al 2012 however only truncating mutations have a known effect on host cell tropism two independent studies have confirmed the absolute requirement of an intact orf 3c for replication of feline coronavirus in the intestinal epithelium chang et al 2012 pedersen et al 2012 fipvs with truncating orf 3c mutations will not replicate in the gut epithelium but will efficiently replicate in macrophages fipvs with non-truncating mutations in the 3 terminus of orf 3c will replicate in the intestine but they do not appear to be infectious under experimental conditions pedersen et al 2012 the function of the protein expressed by orf 3c is unknown hsieh et al 2013 transiently expressed orf 3c in macrophage-like cells fcwf-4 and found that the protein was distributed mainly in the perinuclear region they then infected fcwf-4 cells expressing the intact orf 3c protein with fipv ntu156 lin et al 2013 which has a functionally mutated orf 3c gene a significant inhibition of viral replication was observed relative to cells not expressing the orf 3c protein this inhibition did not involve autophagy the authors concluded that loss of a functional orf 3c protein in fipvs could enhance viral replication in macrophage-like cells it might also be possible to infer functions to the orf 3c gene product by studying similar and better studied genes in other coronaviruses a genbank blast1
search demonstrated 30 genetic homology between feline coronavirus orf 3c and sars coronavirus orf 3a pedersen et al 2009 although the genetic homology is low the orf 3c protein of feline coronavirus has a similar hydrophilicity profile to its own membrane m protein and to the m and orf 3a proteins of sars coronavirus oostra et al 2006 the sars orf 3a protein has pro-apoptotic properties involving both cells death receptor and mitochondrial pathways mcbride and fielding 2012 similar to fipv orf 3c mutants of the sars orf 3a gene are frequently identified in diseased tissues and encode proteins with shorter n termini than found in wild type ie bat coronavirus forms tan et al 2004 the most recent studies on the orf 3a protein of sars coronavirus indicate that it forms a cation-selective channel that is expressed in infected cells and is involved in release of virions schwarz et al 2011 is it also possible that mutations in fipv orf 3c protein inhibit apoptosis of infected macrophages programmed cell death is a major factor in immunity to viral infection of a cell the first mutation in the s gene that was associated with the fipv biotype was reported by chang et al 2012 who sequenced and compared the complete genomes of 11 fipv-fecv pairs a single nucleotide change within the s gene encoding the fusion peptide was present in 124129 96 fipvs from cats with the wet and dry forms of fip but absent from 11 fecvs a second mutation two nucleotides away was also strongly associated with fipvs either or both of these two single base pair mutations were observed in most fipvs but not in fecvs these mutations designated m1058l and s1060a caused minor changes in single amino acids within the s protein in fipvs ie methionine to leucine at position 1058 and serine to alanine at position 1060 the authors postulated that even minor changes in amino acids might be responsible for the increased macrophage tropism of fipvs since these mutations were only observed in fipvs in diseased tissue and not in virus in feces it can also be assumed that these particular mutations occur outside the intestine possibly in monocytesmacrophages their role in causing disease is unknown but they are more likely to be involved in macrophage infectivity than in subsequent hostvirus immune interactions a second set of s gene mutations was reported by licitra et al 2013 who examined mutations at the s1s2 cleavage site of feline coronaviruses this site is cleaved by furin a protein that processes normal cellular precursor proteins into biologically active forms and is found in large quantities in the golgi network compared to fecvs all fipvs had at least one single base mutation in and around the s1s2 cleavage domain these mutations were unique to each fipv and depending on the number of mutations and exact amino acids that were changed affected the efficiency of cleavage of the s protein by furin in most cases the efficiency was increased while in some cases it was decreased and in others it remained unchanged mutations in the region of the s1s2 cleavage site were not universal to all fipvs unlike the two single base pair mutations described in the s region encoding the fusion peptide which were present in 96 of fipv genomes examined chang et al 2012 only two thirds of the same genomes had mutations at the s1s2 cleavage site licitra et al 2013 there is evidence from a single cat that mutations in the region of the s1s2 cleavage site can occur early in the conversion of fecvs to fipvs licitra et al 2013 two cats in this study shed fecvs in their feces for 23 years before one of them developed fip the same single base pair mutation in the s1s2 cleavage region was identified in the fecal fecv and the fipv from diseased tissues of the cat that developed fip whereas this mutation was not present in the cat that remained unaffected these particular mutations may have resulted from positive selection pressures related to the adaptation of fecv for better replication in monocytemacrophages but not in later processes involving hostvirus interactions the above studies indicate that regions within the c terminus of the protein encoded by the s gene may be important in the conversion of fecvs to fipvs a type i fipv strain c3663 remained fully virulent despite a 735 base pair deletion encoding a predicted 245 amino acid sequence in the n terminus terada et al 2012 this deletion would not affect the fusion peptide or s1s2 cleavage regions of the s protein this begs the question as to what is the role of the n terminus of the s protein it is too soon to say whether all of the mutations relevant to the fecv-to-fipv transition have been found although we do not fully understand how these mutations function in disease they do suggest potential targets for antiviral drugs such as protease inhibitors kim et al 2013 or viral ion channel blockers schwarz et al 2011 loss of virulence in fipvs such as strain wsu-79-1146 has been associated with large mutations encompassing almost the entire orf 7b accessory gene herrewegh et al 1995 herrewegh et al 1998 as well as small mutations including those of only two nucleotide changes takano et al 2011a lin et al 2009 sequenced and compared feline coronavirus orf 7b mutations in ascites or pleural effusions from 20 cats with effusive fip and in feces from 20 clinically healthy fecv infected cats thirty-two of the 40 sequences had an intact orf 7b whereas 840 sequences had deletions of either three or 12 nucleotides however only 38 viruses with deletions were from cats with fip therefore deletions in orf 7b can occur naturally as well as in tissue culture and can occur in both fecvs and fipvs loss of virulence associated with orf 7b mutations in fipvs has also led to false assumptions regarding the importance of this orf in fecv-to-fipv conversion and the designation of feline coronavirus strain wsu-79-1683 as a prototypic fecv which was originally based on cat infection studies comparing type ii wsu-79-1683 which does not cause fip with wsu-79-1146 the prototypic type ii fipv pedersen et al 1984 the authors concluded that wsu-79-1683 did behave as a fecv however this conclusion is counterintuitive since according to the mutation theory the orf 7b mutation should have been in wsu-79-1146 furthermore wsu-79-1683 grew readily in crandell rees feline kidney crfk cells while the enteric coronavirus could not be cultured from infectious feces in any cell line at the time sequencing of wsu-79-1683 also demonstrated a mutated orf 3c whereas the orf 3c of fecvs is always intact chang et al 2010 these findings led to the conclusion that the wsu-79-1683 strain was not a true fecv pedersen 2009 this finding altered the conclusions of many previous studies using wsu-79-1683 and wsu-79-1146 as prototypic fecvs and fipvs respectively 
dedeurwaerder et al 2013a tried to link orf 7b with macrophage tropism and hence with the evolution of fipvs by measuring the replication kinetics of fipv wsu-79-1146 and several specific deletion mutants in monocyte cultures the mutants lacked either the orf 3abc accessory genes fipv-3 orf 7ab fipv-7 or both orf 3abc and orf 7b fipv-37 growth of fipv-7 and fipv-37 could not be sustained in monocyte cultures whereas sustained growth was observed in monocyte cultures infected with intact fipv wsu-79-1146 fipv-3 replicated in monocyte cultures but at a lower level than intact fipv wsu-79-1146 the authors concluded that orf 7 is crucial for fipv replication in monocytesmacrophages they also concluded that their findings support the role of orf 7b in the development of fip and provide an explanation as to why orf 7b is almost always conserved in field strains of fipv however they failed to note that orf 7b is also highly conserved in field strains of fecv pedersen et al 2009 chang et al 2010 therefore it is true that loss of the integrity of orf 7b almost always occurring during cell culture passage will cause fipvs to lose virulence but it is not true that orf 7b mutations are involved in fecv-to-fipv transformation a study by brown et al 2009 temporarily shook the foundations of the internal mutation theory and was supported in theory but not in fact by at least one other group licitra et al 2013 using phylogenetic analyses of coronaviruses identified in a small number of fipv-infected and healthy cats in a regional shelter in new england usa the authors purported to show the existence of two distinct types of feline coronaviruses circulating independently in the population tested one type causing fip and the other not the authors identified five non-contiguous amino acids in the m protein of feline coronavirus that differentiated these two types however the numbers of cats used to construct the phylogenetic trees were inadequate and the authors failed to consider that many of the cats originated from different geographic regions thus introducing genetic drift and population bias several subsequent experiments using larger numbers of cats and taking into consideration geographic bias failed to confirm the existence of distinct fecv and fipv types a study from the netherlands failed to show that the five amino acid sequence defined distinct virus types and concluded that fipvs originate from fecvs in the same environments chang et al 2011 additional studies on a large population of cats taking into consideration genetic differences related to geographic origins also failed to find evidence for the two virus theory or any significant genetic differences between fipvs and fecvs from the same environments pedersen et al 2012 a phylogenetic analysis of fecal and tissue coronaviruses from an outbreak of fip in a group of 20 cats also confirmed that strains of fip-associated feline coronaviruses were very closely related to viruses identified in the feces of healthy cats in the same environment barker et al 2013 this study also provided no evidence that genetically distinct virulent fipv and avirulent fecv strains of feline coronavirus were present during this outbreak considerable information has been gained about mutations affecting biotypes and virulence of feline coronaviruses using reverse genetics haijema et al 2003 generated a mutant of fipv wsu-79-1146 in which the s gene was replaced by that of murine hepatitis virus mhv which allowed recombinant virus to be selected for in murine cells in a second reverse process the fipv s gene was reintroduced to permit growth in feline cells the growth characteristics of this reverse recombinant virus in tissue culture and its virulence for cats were indistinguishable from that of the parental virus fipv wsu-79-1146 this technique was then used to develop an avirulent deletion mutant of fipv wsu-79-1146 that was assessed as a potential vaccine haijema et al 2004 
tekes et al 2008 tekes et al 2010 tekes et al 2012 used a similar reverse genetics technique but with a replication competent molecular clone of the type i fipv black strain as well as the type ii fipv wsu-79-1146 in their first study orf 3abc of fipv black was replaced by a green fluorescent protein and luciferase so that the virus could be tracked in cd14 blood monocytes and dendritic cells tekes et al 2008 in a subsequent study tekes et al 2010 demonstrated that recombinant feline coronaviruses expressing the type ii s protein acquire the ability to efficiently use feline aminopeptidase n for host cell entry while type i viruses use another host cell receptor they also noted that the recombinant virus containing the type ii s gene produced high levels of large plaque virus identical to wild type fipv wsu-79-1146 therefore both the growth kinetics and the efficient usage of aminopeptidase n as a cellular receptor for type ii feline coronaviruses were attributed solely to the s protein in their most recent study tekes et al 2012 studied the virulence of their earlier molecular clones in specific pathogen free spf cats inoculated via the intraperitoneal route both engineered viruses established productive infection in cats as determined by the detection of viral rna in feces and the induction of specific antibodies but neither induced fip unfortunately neither control wild type fipv black nor its recombinant caused fip the authors deduced that the mutations responsible for the loss of virulence occurred upon prior tissue culture passage and resided in orfs 1a m n or 7ab or the 3-untranslated region 3-utr in contrast spf cats infected with wild type fipv wsu-79-1146 and its replication competent molecular clone exhibited clinical signs starting at 23 weeks post infection and one cat in each group had to be euthanased after 7 weeks these two cats along with two others had typical lesions of fip at postmortem examination a full length genome sequence was obtained from one of the cats infected with wild type fipv wsu-79-1146 nine nucleotide differences were observed in the infecting virus with three non-synonymous mutations in the s gene one in the gene encoding non-structural protein 3 replicase gene and one in the e gene significantly the stop codon in the orf 3c accessory gene was changed to encode a glutamine residue thus yielding an intact orf 3c protein a full-length genomic sequence was also obtained from the spleen and kidney of one cat infected with the molecular cloned virus two non-synonymous nucleotide changes were identified in the virus sequence from the spleen while seven non-synonymous and three silent changes were identified in the virus sequence from the kidney restoration of orf 3c was observed once again and viral rna with this genotype was also detected in the feces of both cats this finding appeared to contradict earlier reports suggesting that only enteric biotypes fecvs require an intact orf 3c for intestinal replication chang et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 however fipvs with intact orf 3c genes have been found in the feces of cats with fip and these viruses often have an increase in non-synonymous mutations in the 3 terminus of orf 3c pedersen et al 2012 tekes et al 2012 demonstrated the importance of extending this reverse genetics approach to pathogenic type i feline coronaviruses and the need to generate recombinant fecvs that could be used to study early events in natural fecv-to-fipv evolution three studies from different groups have addressed the behavior of fecv infection and immunity in laboratory cats pedersen et al 2008 kipar et al 2010 vogel et al 2010 these experiments confirmed what had been previously observed in cats naturally infected with fecvs primary fecv infection is largely subclinical or associated with a transient and usually mild diarrhea and is centered in the lower small intestine and colon kipar et al 2010 vogel et al 2010 large amounts of virus are shed in the feces for many weeks and even months after initial infection but with time most cats cease shedding there also appears to be a low level of fecv in blood monocytes during initial infection kipar et al 2010 however immunity is not always solid and as antibody levels in the blood decrease many cats become susceptible to reinfection pedersen et al 2008 these secondary infections closely resemble the primary infection the comparative importance of various feline enteric pathogens including fecv was studied by sabshin et al 2012 in 100 shelter cats fecal samples were collected within 24 h after admission in 50 normal cats and 50 cats with diarrhea and tested by fecal flotation antigen assays pcr and electron microscopy for pathogens twelve enteric pathogens were identified including coronavirus clostridium perfringens enterotoxin a cryptosporidium spp giardia spp cystoisospora spp hookworms ascarids salmonella spp astrovirus feline panleukopenia virus calicivirus and spirometra spp interestingly cats with diarrhea were no more likely to be infected with one or more of these enteropathogens than cats with normal feces 84 in both groups only fecv was significantly more prevalent in cats with diarrhea than in normal cats 58 and 36 respectively fecv was also the most common fecal pathogen being several times more common than any other enteric pathogen studied although numerous strains of fecv are found among cats throughout the world at least one population has remained surprisingly free of infection cats in the falkland islands have no signs of infection and attempts are being made to quarantine these cats from an inadvertent introduction of the virus addie et al 2012 the long isolation of cats in the falklands is indirect evidence that coronaviruses might not have existed in cats at the time of their transit to the island research investigating the fecv-to-fipv pathotype transformation has been hampered by an inability to grow fecv in tissue culture a group from belgium might have solved this problem by creating a long-term feline ileocytecolonocyte cell line using simian virus 40 t antigenhuman telomerase reverse transcriptase for immortalization desmarets et al 2013 this cell line readily propagated two strains of type i fecvs while no infection was seen in cultures inoculated with fipv tissue homogenates the fact that fipvs would not grow in this cell line supports the theory that fipvs lose tropism for the intestinal epithelium and that fecv is the main biotype circulating among cats the creation of this cell line will fill a large hole in the list of reagents needed to study the pathogenic properties of fipv fecvs and therefore fipvs exist as two distinct types based on both serology and sequencing type i fecvsfipvs are unique to cats while type ii fecvsfipvs appear to be recombinants between type i fecvs and the closely related canine coronaviruses serologic differences are due to canine coronavirus s protein sequences encoded by the orf 3a and s gene regions pedersen et al 2009 type i fecvsfipvs predominate in europe and the americas while up to 25 or more feline coronaviruses from asian countries are type ii sharif et al 2010 an et al 2011 amer et al 2012 the exact origin of type ii feline coronaviruses is unknown but their genetic variability suggests that they are continuously being generated the independent nature of these recombination events is indicated by the varying genetic makeup of the hybrid viruses these recombination events are often highly complex this is demonstrated by strains such as ntu156 from taiwan lin et al 2013 this strain not only contains an in-frame deletion of 442 nucleotides in orf 3c a mutation associated with the fecv-to-fipv biotype change but also two crossover events with recombination sites located in the rna-dependent rna polymerase and m genes this produced a new virus with one-third of its genome originating from canine coronavirus although not proven it is widely assumed that type ii fipvs are more virulent than type i fipvs lin et al 2013 wang et al 2013 possibly associated with the ease with which they are propagated in a number of cat and dog cell lines type ii fipvs might also be more likely to be transmitted between cats and to be associated with outbreaks of fip such as one described in a taiwanese shelter wang et al 2013 the question of whether fipv is transmitted cat-to-cat horizontal transmission or by internal mutation from fecv vertical transmission has also been a topic of interest there is no solid evidence that cats with fip readily transmit fipv directly to other cats although the possibility has been suggested as an explanation for rare mini-outbreaks of fip pedersen 2009 fipv can cause disease when fed to laboratory cats and some experimentally infected cats will shed low levels of fipv-like virus pedersen et al 2009 pedersen et al 2012 however such virus does not appear to be infectious when fed to other cats pedersen et al 2012 some cats with naturally acquired fip can also shed either fecv or a coronavirus that appears genetically similar to the fipv within the same cats chang et al 2010 an outbreak of fip in taiwan associated with a type ii fipv appeared to be transmissible but was self-limiting either due to quarantine measures or more likely to genetic drift wang et al 2013 sequential samples collected over time from this outbreak documented the replacement of the original virus which had an intact orf 3c with viruses having functionally mutated orf 3c this provided indirect evidence that orf 3c mutations are more likely to be associated with disease than with infectivity an imbalance in t cell vs b cell immune responses has been evoked as one reason for the inability of cats to resist fipv infection one study demonstrated that the ratio of peripheral blood surface immunoglobulin positive cells sig to cd21 cells was higher in cats with fip than in spf cats and that cells strongly expressing mrna of the plasma cell master gene encoding b lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 blimp-1 were increased takano et al 2009a the mrnas of interleukin 6 cd40 and b cell activating factor baff were also overexpressed in macrophages previously shown to be associated with antibody-dependent enhancement 
vermeulen et al 2013 studied the role of natural killer nk cells and regulatory t cells tregs in the innate and adaptive cell-mediated immunity respectively in cats with naturally occurring fip nk cells and tregs were drastically depleted from the peripheral blood mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen in cats with fip while the mesentery and kidneys from cats with fip did not show any differences when compared to healthy uninfected control cats other regulatory lymphocytes of the cd4cd25foxp3 and cd3cd8foxp3 phenotypes were depleted from both blood and lymph nodes nk cells in cats with fip were upregulated for the activation markers cd16 and cd25 and migration markers cd11b and cd62l while nk cells from lymph nodes had upregulation of cd16 and cd62l only nk cells from the lymph nodes of cats with fip also exhibited less cytotoxic activity than nk cells from the lymph nodes of healthy cats therefore it appears that infection with fipv is associated with severe depletion of both nk cells and tregs and reduced nk cell function this could reduce the capacity of the innate immune system to attack the virus and to suppress the associated immunologic and inflammatory responses the most compelling evidence for the role of t cell immunity in fip might actually come from research with a distantly related coronavirus infection of another species mouse hepatitis virus mhv is one of the most common virus models in laboratory mice mhv like fipv exists as two biotypes designated enterotropic and polytropic polytropic strains of mhv are mainly of laboratory origin and cause a variety of hepatic and neurologic syndromes depending on the laboratory of origin in vitro and in vivo passage history and inbred mouse strain used for the infection study homberger 1997 in contrast enterotropic biotypes tend to predominate in nature most coronavirus contamination in experimental mice colonies is associated with enterotropic strains of mhv brought in from wild mice interestingly certain polytropic laboratory strains of mhv cause a disease syndrome analogous to fip of cats when they infect an interferon ifn- deficient strain of mice kyuwa et al 1998 this prompted additional comparative studies of enterotropic and polytropic strains of mhv compton et al 2004 immunocompetent as well as b and t cell deficient strains of laboratory mice were infected with an enterotropic strain of mhv mhv-y the infection in immunocompetent mice was limited to the small intestine for the first week and then to the cecum and colon for the next 2 weeks b cell deficient mice also developed chronic subclinical infection restricted to the gastrointestinal tract but lasting for 78 weeks the pattern of infection in these two strains of mice was reminiscent of fecv infection in laboratory cats pedersen et al 2008 kipar et al 2010 in contrast t cell deficient mice infected with mhv-y developed a multi-systemic lethal infection with virus detected in the intestine during the first week the mice then developed peritonitis by week 2 with virus detected in mesentery and visceral peritoneum before the mice died by weeks 34 these findings with mhv strains in inbred strains of mice support the importance of both ifn- and t cell immunity in resistance to fip in the mouse model it was the hosts response to mhv and not the biotype that determined the disease form enteritis or fip-like disease while in the case of fip genetic differences between the fecv and fipv biotypes determine the host response and disease form enteritis or fip the classical lesions of fip are the pyogranuloma of the effusive form and the somewhat more typical granuloma of the dry form as the name implies the pyogranuloma is an accumulation of macrophages neutrophils lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells that tend to form small aggregations around venules in the target tissues these cells arrive from the bloodstream as a result of upregulation of both adhesion proteins and their receptors olyslaegers et al 2013 studied the altered expression of the transmigration adhesion molecules cd11a cd11b cd15s cd18 cd49d and cd54 on blood leukocytes from cats with naturally occurring fip they found that t and b lymphocytes and monocytes expressed higher levels of cd11a and cd18 while b lymphocytes had increased levels of expression of cd49d and granulocytes had increased levels of expression of cd11b it was concluded that all of these blood leukocytes exhibited features of systemic activation in cats with fip and that this contributed to their transmigration into the pyogranulomas seen in the disease the pyogranuloma is also strongly associated with edema and the effusion of large volumes of a proteinaceous fluid that is rich in plasma proteins hemoglobin breakdown products inflammatory proteins of many types and activated clotting factors the factors responsible for this outpouring of fluid have not been identified fully but at least one of these factors appears to be vascular endothelial growth factor vegf takano et al 2011a this is produced by fipv infected monocytes and macrophages other proteins such as tumor necrosis factor tnf- granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor gm-csf and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf are also produced by macrophages in cats with fip and are thought to contribute to increased survival of neutrophils takano et al 2009b the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk pathway has been shown to play an important role in the over production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in fipv infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs regan et al 2009 clinically normal cats living in catteries with enzootic fecv infection overall had higher serum ifn- concentrations than cats in catteries experiencing losses due to fip and catteries free of infection giordano and paltrinieri 2009 ifn- concentrations were high in the sera of cats with fip and even higher in body cavity effusions the latter thought to reflect production by local inflammation it was concluded that fecv-infected cats have a strong systemic ifn- response while cats with fip have a strong ifn- response at the tissue level a test to measure the ability of leukocytes in whole blood to produce ifn- protein and mrna in vitro in response to eight immunogenic peptides derived from the n protein of virulent fipvs and avirulent fecvs feline coronaviruses has been developed for cats rossi et al 2011 the sequences used were obtained from an earlier study by battilani et al 2010 that compared a small number of n gene sequences from lesions of cats with fip and feces of clinically healthy cats and purported to show n epitopes that would differentiate the two the test was applied to a group of healthy cats and another group with chronic diseases other than fip cats with chronic diseases other than fip responded with increases in both ifn- protein and mrna when exposed to peptides that were presumed to be specific for avirulent fecv or a mixture of avirulent fecv and virulent fipv epitopes unfortunately no results were given for cats with fip 
satoh et al 2011a developed monoclonal antibodies against feline ifn- and used them to study immune responses to fipv pbmcs from cats experimentally infected with fipv that did not develop clinical disease had significantly increased levels of ifn- production after exposure to heatinactivated fipv compared to cats that died of fip the increased ifn- levels were more marked in cd8 than cd4 t cells it was concluded that cell-mediated immunity was important in resistance to fip 
dedeurwaerder et al 2013b studied the role of the orf 7a gene product in antiviral defense deletion of orf 7a and orf 7b of fipv wsu-79-1146 rendered the virus more susceptible to ifn- treatment in cell culture they then separately added orf 7a and orf 7b back into the mutant virus orf 7a but not orf 7b rescued normal sensitivity to ifn- when these insertions were performed in a mutant of fipv wsu-79-1146 with deletions of orf 3abc and orf 7ab sensitivity to ifn- was not restored it was concluded that the orf 7a protein acted as a type i ifn antagonist in the presence of orf 3abc proteins and protected fipv against the effects of this particular host cell antiviral response one of the newest approaches to studying immune responses involves transcriptional profiling wherein the various cellular mrnas triggered by a viral infection can be monitored for up- or down-regulation harun et al 2013 demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach using crfk cells exposed to fipv wsu-79-1146 for 3 h they were able to detect 18899 of the 19046 annotated feline genes based on results from their culture studies and kals z test 44 genes were upregulated 61 genes were not affected by virus infection and the remaining genes were down-regulated this transcriptional profile was used to identify three genes a3h pd-1 and pd-l1 that were both upregulated and potentially relevant to fip a real-time rt-pcr was than developed for each gene and the level of expression in pbmcs from seven cats with confirmed fip was measured upregulation of cdnas from the three genes was observed but it tended to be low and highly variable between individual genes as well as cats although this study did not report details on the number of replicates used in various parts of the study and could have used actual normal and diseased tissuescells in preference to experimentally infected and non-infected crfk cells it is an approach that will be applied much more in the future there is ample evidence from experimental studies that fipv infection is greatly enhanced in the presence of coronavirus antibodies whether they are actively elicited by exposure to fecv or avirulent fipvs or passively administered in the form of immune serum from either fecv- or fipv-infected cats pedersen 2009 this antibody-dependent enhancement ade is best demonstrated when the antibody and challenge strain of fipv are of similar type takano et al 2008 this ade is not unique to feline coronaviruses and has been the bane of vaccines used or tested in the field against dengue virus feline immunodeficiency virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 huisman et al 2009 the exact anti-coronavirus epitopes responsible for ade have been somewhat elusive but they appear to reside in the s protein satoh et al 2011b synthesized 81 peptides from the s2 region of the s protein of a type i fipv ku-2 and type ii fipv wsu-79-1146 and from the n protein of fipv ku-2 they used these peptides to stimulate ifn- production from pbmcs of cats experimentally infected with fipv and identified a number of linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes at different positions in the s2 and n regions within both type i and type ii fipvs satoh et al 2010 also studied three baculovirus expressed proteins derived from different regions of the s2 domain of the s protein of the type i fipv ku-2 strain one of these proteins which spanned the region from the fusion peptide to the heptad repeat 2 region induced a vigorous t helper type 1 th1 and t helper type 2 th2 immune response in mice out of 30 peptides derived from this region that were tested in mice four peptides that included both th1 and th2 epitopes were identified the authors concluded that these regions should be explored in cats as potential immunogens 
takano et al 2011b also studied the putative ade epitopes in fipv wsu-79-1146 with a battery of monoclonal antibodies against the virus neutralizing epitope on the s protein virus cultures exposed to one of these monoclonal antibodies eventually yielded a virus with two amino acid changes in the neutralizing epitope of the s protein that rendered it resistant to neutralization in the process the monoclonal antibody used to produce this mutant also lost its ability to enhance the replication of homologous virus thus suggesting that virus neutralization and ade were present in the same region of the s protein the mutant virus used in the study also replicated to lower levels in monocytemacrophages evasion of antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis has been studied in crfk cells and monocytes infected with fipv wsu-79-1146 and an orf 3abcorf 7b deletion mutant cornelissen et al 2009 surface expression of viral proteins by infected cells whether by wild type fipv or the deletion mutant prevented complement-mediated lysis even though controls showed it to be functional the authors postulated that this was a new mechanism for fipv to evade the immune system a different evasion route was proposed by dewerchin et al 2008 monocytes infected with fipv express viral proteins on their plasma membranes upon binding of antibodies these proteins are rapidly internalized through a clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathway which is also dependent on dynamin van hamme et al 2008 in doing so the infected monocytes can escape antibody-dependent cell lysis in a subsequent study dewerchin et al 2014 identified kinases and cytoskeletal proteins that were involved in internalization and subsequent intracellular transport of fipv myosin light chain kinase and myosin 1 were crucial for the initiation of the internalization process as shown by the co-localization of both proteins with antigens prior to virus internalization one minute after internalization commenced the virus-laden vesicles had co-localized with microtubules and accumulated at the microtubule organizing center after 1030 min this activity of myosin light chain kinase was effectively inhibited by ml-7 thus identifying a possible target for an anti-viral drug the mechanism by which the various feline coronaviruses attach to their host cells is not known type ii fipvs appear to utilize aminopeptidase n as their principal receptor while the primary receptor for type i feline coronaviruses is unknown the lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin dc-sign cd209 can act as a co-receptor regan whittaker 2008 regan et al 2010 these receptors are undoubtedly important for fecv binding to target enterocytes but whether they play a role in infection of macrophages by fipvs is unknown it is possible that fipvs could enter their target macrophages using less specific means such as through the fc-receptors used for complement binding a spate of papers describing possible vaccines against fip has appeared over the last three decades pedersen 2009 several reportedly showed protection but only one of doubtful efficacy went into commercial production however recently there has been a renewed interest in fip vaccines blint et al 2013 developed a vaccine based on a pair of recombinant viruses derived from the type ii fipv strain df2 a virus nearly identical to fipv wsu-79-1146 one strain was avirulent and the other of low virulence spf cats appeared to be fully protected against virulent fipv df2 after two oronasal and two intramuscular injections 2 weeks apart surprisingly purebred british shorthair cats were not protected following the same vaccine regimen although experimental and control groups were small vaccination with the avirulent virus induced ade and following challenge-exposure all cats developed fip 40 of cats had prolonged survival while 60 died from fulminant disease the researchers evoked differences between conventional and spf cats as well as heterologous virus pre-exposure as reasons for the various experimental outcomes 
takano et al 2014a immunized cats with th1 stimulating peptides identified previously in the n protein of the type i fipv strain ku-2 using feline cpg-oligodeoxynucleotides fcpg-odns as adjuvants some immunity was demonstrated against challenge-exposure with the type ii fipv strain wsu-79-1146 but immune tolerance was also observed at higher vaccine dosages the researchers concluded that further investigations on the combination and concentrations of the peptides and fcpg-odns along with dose frequency and route of administration were needed takano et al 2014b identified strong th1 epitopes within the s1 domain of the s protein and in the m protein of both type i ku-2 and type ii wsu-79-1146 fipvs interestingly no immunodominant antibody binding th1 epitope-containing peptide was identified in the primary antibody binding s1 domain of the type ii fipv eleven th1 epitope-containing peptides were identified in the s m and n proteins that were common to both type i and type ii fipvs three of these peptides were administered with cpg-odns to spf cats two of these peptides from the s1 and m proteins induced th1 activity to peptide stimulation of pbmc cultures but no cat infection results were reported early research strongly suggested that susceptibility to fip might be controlled to some extent by genetic factors pedersen 2009 a genome-wide association study of a relatively large number of birman cats identified five regions on four different chromosomes that could harbor genes involved in susceptibility golovko et al 2013 five candidate genes elmo1 rraga tnsf10 erap1 and erap2 were identified in these four regions all are associated with processes relevant to fip such as cellular migration phagocytosis apoptosis and virushost interactions these associations require confirmation and further study as they might only be relevant to one breed if genetics are involved in the disease as it appears the exact genes and pathways involved appear to be numerous and therefore inheritance is likely to be complex we are rapidly gaining a better understanding of the mutational events that cause fecvs to become fipvs but we lack knowledge of how these mutations are involved in immunopathogenesis at least three separate types of mutations have been associated with the acquisition of fip virulence and more are likely to be discovered cell lines that will replicate fecvs in vitro have been developed and this coupled with the creation of infectious molecular clones of fipv will hopefully allow us to assess the importance of these and any future mutations a number of new reagents and procedures have given us a window into the cells involved in the inflammatory and immune responses that characterize the two distinct yet overlapping clinical forms of fip other environmental and host factors undoubtedly play a role in determining the outcome of exposure but their roles are not understood the elaboration of various cytokines and other inflammatory proteins in the fip disease process has been extensively studied but how these various factors are stimulated and their role in pathology is poorly understood a possible role for genetic susceptibility has been identified in at least one breed of cats but the genetics appear to be highly complex and cannot explain the entire disease incidence a more parsimonious conclusion is that fip results from a confluence of numerous viral host and environmental factors akin to the perfect storm although we are heartened by our increasing knowledge of this disease we are continually reminded of the words of robert frost in his poem the secret sits we dance round in a ring and suppose but the secret sits in the middle and knows the author has no financial or personal relationship with

with feline infectious peritonitis treated with a protease inhibitor krishani perera dinali athri rathnayake d hongwei liu niels pedersen c william groutas c kyeong-ok chang yunjeong kim   coronaviruses are a group of diverse rna viruses that can cause a number of diseases in animals and humans coronaviruses have a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome and belong to the family coronaviridae which are further classified into four genera alpha- beta- gamma- and deltacoronaviruses king et al 2011 feline coronaviruses belong to the genus alphacoronavirus and are the causative agent of enteritis in cats feline enteric coronavirus infections are quite common in multi-cat environments such as shelters rescues and catteries since more than a third of the affected cats chronically shed viruses in the stool and feline coronaviruses are relatively stable in the environment it is difficult to eliminate feline coronaviruses from the affected cat populations addie et al 2019 pedersen et al 2008 cats infected with feline coronaviruses may show mild to severe enteritis but they usually recover without complications however a small number of cats may develop feline infectious peritonitis fip a highly fatal systemic disease following enteric coronavirus infection pedersen 2009 2014 the detailed mechanism of fip development is still elusive but it is believed that fip arises in individual cats through altered viral tropism that allows viral replication in the macrophages barker et al 2013 chang et al 2012 licitra et al 2013 pedersen et al 2009 2012 in the presence of inadequate cellular immunity of the affected cats pedersen 2014 fip are commonly described as wet or dry forms based on the presence or absence of effusion respectively but these forms may switch as the disease progresses in some cats the clinical signs of fip are variable and depend on the affected organs and may include fever jaundice effusion weight loss or neurological signs and ocular lesions pedersen 2014 although fip is almost invariably fatal once cats develop clinical signs there is no commercially available treatment licensed for fip with only supportive treatment being available following viral entry into host cells coronaviruses produce viral polyproteins composed of non-structural viral proteins which are subsequently cleaved into mature functional viral proteins by virally-encoded 3c-like protease 3clpro and papain-like protease the released viral proteins form the replicase-transcriptase complex which is required for rna replication and transcription of the subgenomic rnas thus inhibition of viral proteases blocks viral replication we have previously reported the synthesis of protease inhibitors for feline coronavirus kim et al 2012a 2013 kim et al 2015 and showed the efficacy of one of the inhibitors gc376 in cats with experimentally induced fip kim et al 2016 and naturally-occurring fip in a field trial pedersen et al 2018 we have also reported the amino acid changes n25s a252s and k260 n in the 3clpro of feline coronavirus collected from a patient who was treated with gc376 but did not show clinical resistance to multiple rounds of treatment in the field trial pedersen et al 2018 in this study we assessed the effects of the amino acid changes in the feline coronavirus 3clpro against gc376 in florescence resonance energy transfer fret assay by generating 3clpro carrying the amino acid changes we also conducted modelling of 3clpro carrying the amino acid changes and compared them with wild-type pre-treatment 3clpro to probe the structural basis for these findings the results showed that n25s but not a252s and k260 n confers a statistically significant but small reduction in susceptibility to gc376 with up to 168-fold increase in the 50 inhibitory concentration ic50 compared to that of wild-type 3clpro interestingly none of these amino acid changes in 3clpro decreased susceptibility to another 3clpro inhibitor npi52 that shares the similar structure with gc376 the results of this study may explain the observed absence of clinical resistance to the long-term antiviral treatment in the patients in the field trial one and  year-old castrated male himalayan cat ct10 that was presented with a wet form of fip was treated with gc376 in a field trial during 20162017 pedersen et al 2018 he was diagnosed with fip based on physical examination signalment clinical history laboratory test results on blood and effusion prior to the enrollment in the trial pedersen et al 2018 at admission he exhibited lethargy inappetance and abdominal effusion with enlarged colonic lymph node and had been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone prior to entry into the trial the first round of treatment gc376 at 10 to 30 mgkginjection twice daily lasted for 9 weeks one month after discontinuation of the treatment he relapsed with fever and lethargy and was re-treated gc376 at 75 to 15 mgkginjection twice daily for 12 weeks during these treatments he remained in clinical remission however about 5 weeks following the discontinuation of the second treatment he relapsed again with typical intra-abdominal lesions without neurological signs and was euthanized pedersen et al 2018 the time between the first day of treatment and euthanasia is 236 days on necropsy tissue samples were collected and prepared for sequence analysis of feline coronavirus 3clpro pedersen et al 2018 comparison of the amino acid sequences of feline coronavirus 3clpro from the pre-treatment ascites sample and the postmortem tissue samples has previously revealed amino acid changes of n25s and k260 n in the kidney and n25s a252s and k260 n in the lung and spleen pedersen et al 2018 fig 1

 there was no statistically significant difference in the activity among the 3clpros which indicates that the amino acid changes do not affect the function of 3clpro compared to that of wt 3clpro fig 2 when the inhibitory activity of gc376 was determined against the wt and mutant 3clpros it was found that single amino acid change of n25s but not a252s or k260 n led to a statistically significant increase in the ic50 value of gc376 compared to that of wt 3clpro fig 3
a and b however the increase in the ic50 value was marginal with a fold-change of 138 in ic50 the 3clpro carrying a double mutation n25s and n260 n or a triple mutation n25s a252s and k260 n also significantly increased the ic50 value of gc376 by 153 and 168-fold respectively compared to wt 3clpro however the ic50 values of gc376 against 3clpro with a double or a triple mutation were not statistically different from that of 3clpro carrying a single mutation of n25s fig 3a and b these findings indicate that a252s and k260 n mutations do not affect the susceptibility of 3clpro against gc376 npi52 is a tripeptidyl compound that shares a similar backbone structure with gc376 and has a similarly potent activity against feline coronavirus as gc376 in the fret assay and cell culture kim et al 2015 however unlike those of gc376 there was no difference in the ic50 values of 3clpro with wt single double or triple mutations against npi52 fig3a and b the crystal structure of feline coronavirus 3clpro pdb number 4zro modified to show n25s a252s and k260 n was analyzed using the pymol molecular graphics system version 18 schrodinger llc cambridge ma delano 2010 fig4
a the n25 is adjacent to the catalytic site while a252 and k260 are located in the domain iii near the c terminus multiple sequence analysis of feline coronavirus strains whose 3clpro sequences are available in the pubmed database showed that n25 and a252 are invariably conserved in all feline coronavirus strains and k260 is also highly conserved with only one strain having arg r at the same position fig 4a multiple sequence alignment of feline coronavirus 3clpro also revealed that the residues that form hydrogen bond interactions with gc376 in tgev 3clpro t47 f139 h162 h163 and e165 kim et al 2012a are conserved in all feline coronaviruses data not shown superposition of the homology structure of ct10 3clpro wt and the crystal structures of tgev-gc376 pdb accession number 4f49 and feline coronavirus 3clpro pdb accession number 4zro showed that these residues t47 f139 h162 h163 and e165 are aligned closely in the catalytic site of 3clpro fig 4b and c suggesting that these residues likely form hydrogen bonds with gc376 in feline coronavirus 3clpro in addition n25 does not seem to form interactions with gc376 but is located close to h41 fig 4b and c c144 and h41 are the catalytic residues in the active site of 3clpro we then explored the potential interactions of n25 a252 and k260 with neighboring residues using a crystal structure of feline coronavirus 3clpro pdb 4zro with the ring web server n25 is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with the main chains of y22 h41 a catalytic residue and a44 with hydrogen bond lengths of 3029 3131 3486 and 2615  respectively fig 5
a substitution of asn with ser at position 25 may disrupt the formation of the putative hydrogen bonds with h41 and a44 while retaining the hydrogen bonds with y22 fig 5b a252 is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with the main chains of n248 and m249 with hydrogen bond lengths of 2810 and 3432  respectively fig 5c substitution of ala with ser at position 252 does not seem to affect those hydrogen bond formations fig 5d k260 is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with the main chains of s257 g263 and c264 with hydrogen bond lengths of 3226 3267 and 3037  respectively fig 5e substitution of lys with asn at position 260 does not seem to affect those hydrogen bond formations fig 5f drug resistance is an increasing concern in antiviral therapy with prolonged drug exposure and high viral mutation rates because greatly reduced susceptibility to a drug can compromise clinical efficacy of antiviral treatment emergence of drug resistance is influenced by multiple factors such as patient compliance immune status of patients suboptimal dosage drug potency genetic barrier of a drug to resistance viral fitness or the biology of virus reviewed in gotte 2012 strasfeld and chou 2010 drug resistance is caused by the development of viral mutations that arise during antiviral treatment or by pre-existing virus variants that carry such mutations viral mutations can confer various levels of reduced susceptibility or resistance to a drug and clinically meaningful drug resistance can arise when viral replication is insufficiently suppressed by plasma drug concentrations antiviral compounds have varying genetic barriers to resistance those with low genetic barriers relatively readily lead to the emergence of mutations associated with clinically meaningful resistance and may not be suitable for monotherapy or longer duration of treatment in contrast those with high genetic barriers have reduced risks of developing resistance during antiviral treatment reviewed in gotte 2012 strasfeld and chou 2010 therefore identifying and understanding drug resistance of an antiviral compound can help effective treatment regime to be devised feline coronaviruses are divided into serotypes i and ii based on antigenicity addie et al 2003 benetka et al 2004 kummrow et al 2005 pedersen 2009 wang et al 2014 serotype i feline coronaviruses are the predominant type in the field but they hardly grow in cell culture in our previous study we reported that serial passages of a serotype ii feline coronavirus in the presence of gc376 in cell culture did not lead to emergence of resistant viruses for up to 20 passages although a tripeptidyl compound npi52 that shares a similar backbone structure with gc376 readily led to resistant viruses kim et al 2016 in the field trial we identified amino acid changes in feline coronavirus 3clpro from a feline patient that received intermittent treatment for the duration of about 8 months fig 1 pedersen et al 2018 this patient did not show evidence of clinical drug resistance during treatment however we set out to study the nature of those amino acid changes in 3clpro the feline coronavirus from the patient is a serotype i strain based on the sequence analysis of the regions spanning the spike gene to examine the effects of the amino acid changes on the susceptibility to gc376 we generated the recombinant 3clpro carrying the amino acid changes and determined the changes in their susceptibility to gc376 and npi52 in the fret assay fig 2 fig 3 among single n25s a252s or k260 n double n25s  k260 n or triple n25s  a252s  k260 n amino acid changes only those containing n25s led to a statistically significant reduction in susceptibility to gc376 but the reduction was marginal up to a 168-fold increase in ic50 compared to that of wt fig 3a interestingly a252s or k260 n single mutations did not change the susceptibility of 3clpro to gc376 nor did further potentiate the effect of n25s in 3clpro in the fret assay fig 3a considering the fact that the plasma drug concentrations of gc376 are 205834-fold over the 50 effective concentration ec50 in cats receiving the drug kim et al 2016 this result combined with the previous finding of observed difficulty of raising drug resistance viruses in cell culture may help explain the absence of clinical drug resistance in the patients that received treatment for an extended period in the field trial npi52 is a tripeptidyl compound that shares the core structure with gc376 but has an additional residue that corresponds to the p3 position in our previous report serial passages of serotype ii feline coronavirus in the presence of npi52 readily led to emergence of viruses with npi52-resistant phenotype with an increase of ec50 by 15-fold compared to wt kim et al 2016 npi52-resistant viruses have a single s131c mutation and this mutation is away from the catalytic site of 3clpro interestingly npi52-resistant viruses retained susceptibility to gc376 in cell culture kim et al 2016 in this study the fret assay showed that the amino acid substitutions of n25s a252s and k260n did not affect the susceptibility of 3clpro to npi52 fig 3a and b confirming that gc376 and npi52 although sharing a similar chemical structure have disparate mechanisms of inducing mutations in feline coronavirus 3clpro there are only a few reports available on coronavirus 3clpro inhibitors and their resistance deng et al deng et al 2014 reported single mutation t26i and d65 g and double mutations t26id65g and t26ia298d that are responsible for resistance of a murine hepatitis virus mhv a coronavirus to a 3clpro inhibitor grl-001 in cell culture mhv carrying a single mutation was partially resistant to the inhibitor compared to wt virus but double mutations further increased viral resistance in cells although these mutations arose rapidly in cell culture indicating that this specific inhibitor has low-genetic barrier to resistance the mutated viruses had reduced viral fitness in cells and were highly attenuated in the host mice in that study t26i and d65 located in and away from the active site of mhv 3clpro respectively was speculated to affect inhibitor binding indirectly or directly although the role of a298d in the domain iii was unclear deng et al 2014 the n25s in feline coronavirus 3clpro is in the active site of 3clpro and our 3d modelling study showed that the loss of a side chain from n25s substitution is predicted to partially lose hydrogen bonds with residues in the active site fig 5a and b this partial loss of bonds may explain the marginal reduction in susceptibility of 3clpro to gc376 by n25s substitution the modelling study also predicted that a252s and k260 n substitutions in domain iii fig 5c-f have no changes in the interactions with neighboring residues which may explain the findings from the fret assay where these mutations do not seem to affect the proteolytic activity of 3clpro emergence of viral resistance to antivirals during treatment especially long-term treatment is a concern amino acid changes of n25s a252s and k260n were found in the 3clpro of feline coronavirus obtained from a cat patient that received multiple rounds of antiviral treatment but did not show clinical resistance the n25s substitution in the 3clpro led to a statistically significant but slight reduction in susceptibility to gc376 in the fret assay up to 168-fold in ic50 but no change in susceptibility was observed with a252s and k260n substitutions the results of this study are consistent with the previous findings showing high genetic barriers of feline coronavirus 3clpro for selecting resistance against gc376 further studies including x-ray crystallography on mutant 3clpro and generation of recombinant viruses carrying those mutations will help us to gain better understanding of the roles of those substitutions this research was funded by the national institutes of health grant number r01 ai130092 and

yuta hozumi changchuan yin guo-wei wei  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a continuously devastating public health and the world economy one of the major challenges in controlling the covid-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission which are elusive and defenseless in most situations the pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic covid-19 remain mysterious based on the genotyping of 20656 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 genome isolates we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to sars-cov-2 11083gt mutation ie leucine l to phenylalanine f substitution at the residue 37 l37f of nonstructure protein 6 nsp6 by analyzing the distribution of 11083gt in various countries we unveil that 11083gt may correlate with the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 moreover we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083gt mutation ratio indicating that 11083gt hinders sars-cov-2 transmission capacity sequence alignment found both nsp6 and residue 37 neighborhoods are relatively conservative over a few coronaviral species indicating their importance in regulating host cell autophagy to undermine innate cellular defense against viral infection using machine learning and topological data analysis we demonstrate that mutation l37f has made nsp6 energetically less stable the rigidity and flexibility index and several network models suggest that mutation l37f may have compromised the nsp6 function leading to a relatively weak sars-cov subtype this assessment is a good agreement with our genotyping of sars-cov-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months  the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread to more than 215 countries and territories with 8385440 positive cases and 450686 fatalities as of june 19 2020 40  unlike sars-cov that mainly infects the lower respiratory tract sars-cov-2 is observed with a high level of shedding at the upper respiratory tract 41  a wide variety of covid-19 symptoms have been reported including fever or chills body or muscle aches headache stuffy or congested nose dry cough fatigue sore throat and loss of taste or smell 2-14 days after exposure to the virus 41  severe symptoms like high fever severe cough and shortness of breath indicate the onset of pneumonia less common gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea nausea and vomiting have been listed at the centers for disease control and prevention currently symptom-based testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine are the main strategies for controlling and combating covid-19 however viable viruses have also been isolated from asymptomatic cases 31  asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases can play an important role in transmitting coronavirus 23  elusive asymptomatic transmission is regarded as the achilles heel of current strategies to control covid-19 24  early studies with 235 cases of influenza virus infections indicate that the duration of influenza viral shedding was shorter and decayed faster and quantitative viral loads were lower in asymptomatic than in symptomatic cases 27 the epidemiological and virological characteristics of covid-19 asymptomatic pathogenicity remains a mystery sars-cov-2 is a non-segmented positive-sense rna virus that belongs to the -coronavirus genus coronaviridae family and nidovirales order many rna viruses such as the flu virus are prone to mutations due to the lack of proofreading in their genetic evolutions viral mutations are driven by a variety of factors including replication mechanism polymerase fidelity access to proofreading or post-replicative repair sequence context cellular environment and host immune responses or gene editing 34  benefit from an error-correction mechanism common to the nidovirales order the replication of coronavirus is regulated by a bi-functional enzyme nonstructure protein 14 nsp14 19  therefore sars-cov-2 maintains relatively high accuracy in virus replication and transcription compared with the flu virus nonetheless sars-cov-2 has had 10620 single mutations for the genome collected on january 5 2020 38 42  although the impacts of mutations on sars-cov-2 transmission and pathogenicity 2 20 and covid-19 diagnosis vaccine and medicine have been studied 38  little is known about the connection between viral evolution and asymptomatic transmissions this work reports the first association of a sars-cov-2 single nucleotide polymorphism snp variant and covid-19 asymptomatic cases based on the genotyping of 20656 sars-cov-2 genome isolates we reveal a significant correlation between asymptomatic infections and sars-cov-2 single mutation 11083gt-l37f on nsp6 nsp6 is a common protein of  and -coronaviruses that locate at the endoplasmic reticulum er 9  as a multiple-spanning transmembrane protein coronavirus nsp6 participates in viral autophagic regulation autophagy degrades alien components to provide an innate defense against viral infection and promote cell death and morbidity 32  in response to extreme cases of starvation autophagy generates autophagosomes to transfer long-lived proteins unnecessary or dysfunctional components to lysosomes for orderly degradation studies show that nsp6 undermines the capability of autophagosomes to transport viral components to lysosomes for degradation by rendering smaller diameter autophagosomes in nutrient-rich media and thus enhancing viral replication 9  additionally nsp6 proteins induce a higher number of autophagosomes per cell compared with starvation to facilitate the assembly of replicase proteins 4 9  although further studies are required to understand the molecular mechanism of the nsp6 regulation of autophagy it is clear that coronavirus nsp6 is extremely important to viral protein folding viral assembly and the replication cycle it is of paramount importance to understand how nsp6 mutation l37f leads to covid-19 asymptomatic transmission and reduced virulence we show that nsp6 is a relatively conservative protein and the region around residues is quite conservative over several sars-cov-2 related genomes to maintain the crucial regulative function of nsp6 using artificial intelligence ai topological data analysis tda and a variety of network models we further demonstrate that mutation l37f disrupts the folding stability of nsp6 we uncover the correlation between nsp6 mutation l37f and weakened sars-cov-2 virulence we also analyze the global transmission and find the decay tendency of nsp6 mutation l37f we prove that the evolutionary dynamics of l37f is ageand gender-independent we analyze 20656 sars-cov-2 complete genome sequences deposited in gisaid  httpswwwgisaido rg database up to june 19 2020 among them 7243 samples have patient status information recorded as asymptomatic symptomatic hospitalized icu deceased and so on in particular 83 samples are labeled with asymptomatic 53 and symptomatic 30 cases by genotyping 53 genome samples we find that mutation 1083gt is significantly relevant with asymptomatic infection with a p-value being much smaller than 005 mutation 11083gt changes leucine l residue at position 37 of nsp6 to phenylalanine f denoted as l37f in the following sections we investigate the relationship between mutation 11083gt-l37f and asymptomatic infections using both gene-specific analysis and protein-specific analysis the global evolution and transmission pathway of the mutation is studied as well our customized dataset generated from genotyping 20656 sars-cov-2 complete genome sequences downloaded from the gisaid database is summarized in table 1  here patient status referred to as incomplete records of asymptomatic symptomatic hospitalized deceased gender etc additionally our dataset contains data collection dates and locations of genome isolates the detailed information of our dataset is available in the supporting information we first analyze 83 sequences that have either asymptomatic or symptomatic labels submitted from japan the statistic analysis shows that the pearson correlation coefficient between asymptomatic records and 10083gt is 0606 moreover the p-value is 12910 9  which reveals the significant relevance between asymptomatic and single mutation 11083gt-l37f next we split our genotyping dataset of 20656 sequences into different countries and extract those records with the 11083gt mutation table 2 summarizes the total number of sequences related to 11083gt-l37f denoted as n l37f  the total number of sequences n s  the 11083gt-l37f ratio the number of total cases the number of total deaths and the death ratio of 25 countries up to june 19 2020 respectively a complete table for all countriesregions can be found in the supporting information table 2 suggests that the 11083gt-l37f ratio correlates with the death ratio for example singapore has the highest 11083gt-l37f mutation ratio as of 0644 a piece of recent news reported that half of the covid-19 cases in singapore are symptomless 25  which matches our finding that mutation 11083gt-l37f is relevant to the asymptomatic infections moreover singapore has the second-lowest death ratio as listed in table 2  suggesting that single mutation 11083gt-l37f may have weakened sars-cov-2 virulence a similar deduction can be obtained from the records of turkey jordan norway australia and south korea the relatively high 11083gt-l37f mutation ratio greater than 0200 with a correspondingly low death ratio less than 300 further validates that 11083gt-l37f may be relevant to the asymptomatic-induced the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 moreover 11 out of 17 countries whose mutation ratios are less than 0200 have a death ratio greater than 45 the death ratios of the united kingdom belgium france and spain are even higher than 10 which supports our assumption that mutation 11083gt-l37f weakens sars-cov-2 virulence figure 1 illustrates the number of complete sars-cov-2 sequences in our dataset with 11083gt-l37f detected versus the number of complete sars-cov-2 sequences without 11083gt-l37f detected every 10 days in singapore japan india china united kingdom italy united states australia and spain as well as two states in the united states new york and washington the blue and red bar represents the 11083gt-l37f counts and other mutation counts every ten-day period respectively similar bar plots for all countriesregions involving this specific mutation can be found in the supporting information singapores plot shows that 11083gt was widely found after march 24 2020 which is consistent with the report saying that at least half of singapores newly discovered covid-19 cases show no symptoms 25  almost all of the cases collected from february 12 to february 22 have 11083gt mutation with asymptomatic infections recorded which is the most robust evidence to associate the sars-cov-2 11083gt or l37f mutation on nsp6 with the asymptomatic infections india is one of the countries that also have a large number of 11083gt mutation cases recent news reported that 80 percent of all coronavirus patients in india were asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms 12  which supports our deduction that 11083gt correlates with the asymptomatic infection moreover one can see that mutation 11083gt in china the united kingdom and australia is not as abundant as in singapore japan or india furthermore as discussed before the asymptomatic infection may associate with the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 as well note that from figure 1  china the united states spain and italy have a relatively lower occurrence of 11083gt which may contribute to the relatively high death ratio however this specific mutation is not the only factor in determining the death ratio the number of total infected cases diagnostic testing medical and health conditions age structure nursing-home population etc are also critical factors for example japan has a second-highest ratio of 11083gt-l37f while the death ratio is greater than 5 percent similarly the united kingdom has the third-highest death ratio suggesting its ratio of mutation 11083gt-l37f is not at the last echelon one of the possible reasons is that the healthcare system was heavily broken by a sudden increase in infected cases the lack of proper healthcare attention to a large number of midsevere covid-19 cases resulted in a high mortality ratio note that although russia has the lowest 11083gt-l37f mutation ratio lists in table 2  its 137 death ratio caused by covid-19 is also relatively low one possible reason is russias relatively low median age in total 53 genome samples were related to 11083gt among 542 samples that were collected from may 14 to may 24 in new york after that fewer cases were collected in new york and the 11083gt mutation ratio decreased also the state of washington had a small proportion of 11083gt mutation before may 13 2020 in the first week of june 26 out of 27 genome sequences had mutation 11083gt which may indicate that the asymptomatic infection is becoming increasingly prevalent in washington during the last few months the proportion of the 11083gt mutation in the united kingdom has gone down as shown in figure 1  globally the ratio of samples with the 11083gt mutation over all samples shown in the middle chart of the last row in figure 1 decays over time suggesting the mutation is unfavorable to the viral transmission two abnormal peaks appeared on february 22 and june 2 in the ratio were due to the l37f mutation counts from japan and washington respectively the relatively small numbers of total genome sequences at these dates induce the jumps unfortunately the number of genome sequences decays rapidly after april as shown in figure 1  while globally the number of sars-cov-2 infections increasing steadily according to the whos daily situation reports  httpswwwwhointem ergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports in this section we track the global transmission pathways of the single mutation 11083gt-l37f to understand its spread dynamics we found that the first genome containing single mutation 11083gt-l37f was sequenced in chongqing china on january 18 2020 which can be considered as the ancestor of 11083gt in our dataset however the complete genome sequences released on the gisaid do not include all of the infected cases mutation 11083gt also detected in a co-mutation record 8782ct 11083gt 28144tc in yunnan china one day earlier than chongqings sequence which indicates that the true ancestor of 11083gt might have occurred early than january 18 2020 note that the first sars-cov-2 sequence released in gisaid was collected in wuhan china on december 24 2019 chinas covid19 epicenter wuhan implemented a lockdown on january 23 2020 which explains why china has a relatively low ratio of 11083gt-l37f mutation the first confirmed case reported by the singapore government was on january 23 2020 interestingly the first genome sequence related to mutation 11083gt-l37f was found in singapore on january 292020 only a few days after the first confirmed cases therefore the transmission of covid-19 in singapore at the initial stage contains a large proportion of the11083gt-l37f mutation the prevalence of the11083gt-l37f mutation in singapores sars-cov-2 infections explains its low death ratio mutation 11083gt-l37f first appeared in the united states on january 22 2020 in arizona a 26year-old male with co-mutations 8782ct 11083gt 28144tc 29095ct which is the descendant of 8782ct 11083gt 28144tc found in china since then more records related to 11083gt have appeared in the united states at this stage 236 genome isolates from the united states in our dataset are relevant to 11083gt france and italy are the following countries that found the 11083gt mutation at an early stage both of them detected this mutation on jan 29 2020 although 11083gt mutation has arrived in the united states and the united kingdom at a very early stage different subtypes of sars-cov-2 spread vastly due to their large population which makes the 11083gt mutation non-dominated in jordan the earliest sequence released on gisaid is on march 16 2020 with 11083gt mutation which indicates the high 11083gt ratio in jordan note that multiple reasons may lead to a low death ratio of 090 in jordan one may be due to the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 caused by mutation 11083gt the other is that the healthcare system is in good condition due to the small number of infected patients the first confirmed covid-19 cases reported by the vietnamese government was on january 16 2020 however the first genome isolates related to mutation 11083gt in our dataset was collected on march 17 2020 the 11083gt was found in vietnam two months after the first confirmed cases which result in a low 11083gt mutation ratio surprisingly none of the patients died in vietnam as a low-middle income country with nearly 100 million population and a much less-advanced healthcare system than other countries such as italy the united kingdom and france vietnams success in tackling covid-19 attracts attention they immediately took action to ban the foreign nationals entries and implement strict social distancing rules which is the essential factor in keeping the coronavirus death toll at zero mutations the color of the dominated type of mutation decides the base color of each state one can see that oregon alaska texas and ohio have a higher proportion of 11083gt than the other states while the death ratio in oregon alaska and texas is lower than the average death ratio 547 in the united states as of june 19 2020 note that although the ratio of mutation 11083gt in nevada is 1 only one genome sequence was submitted from nevada hence it is insignificant in the statistics 20656 complete genome sequences 9923 cases have age labels and 9437 cases male cases 4993 and female cases 4444 have gender labels which are used for our age-related and gender-related analysis respectively overall male cases have a slightly higher ratio of the 11083gt-l37f mutation than female cases in terms of age distribution the ratio is significantly higher in the age group of 99-109 years however only 7 cases fall into this group and all data were collected from the united kingdom 2 cases and singapore 5 cases more data and further studies are required to draw any conclusion from this group therefore we conclude that mutation 11083gt-l37f is quite evenly distributed over age and gender groups implying that the mutation does not have a host-dependent behavior figure 3 depicts the sequence and structural information of nsp6 figure 3 a is generated by an online server 30  figure 3 b is plotted by pymol 11  and figure 3 c is created by 1  as shown in figure 3 a nsp6 is a multi-span membrane protein in mutation 11083gt-l37f both leucine and phenylalanine are -amino acids and non-polar however phenylalanine has a benzyl ring on the side chain making the secondary structure of nsp6 more compact as shown in figures 3a and c from the nsp6 protein residue position 34 to 37 the residues are fffl therefore there will be four continuous phenylalanine amino acid ffff after the l37f mutation as a result mutation l37f can stiffen the nsp6 structure by the aromatic-aromatic hydrophobic or -stacking interactions such an additional interaction can significantly change nsp6 function 4  figure 3 c presents the alignment of the sars-cov-2 nsp6 sequence with those of the other four coronaviruses including that of sars-cov the sequence identities between sars-cov-2 nsp6 and the nsp6s of sars-cov 28  ratg13 46  zc45 26  bm48-31 13 are 872 997 979 and 838 respectively note that the overall sequence identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is 838 therefore nsp6 is relatively conservative additionally nsp6 position 37 is in a relatively conservative environment among different species position 37 for all other species is valine which is also hydrophobic and extremely similar to leucine two amino acids differ by one -ch 2 -unit a large region from 25 to 45 has only three mutations among five species indicating the region is potentially important for the protein function there three-dimensional 3d structure of nsp6 is displayed in figure 3 b to further understand the impact of mutation l37f on nsp6 we carry several theoretical analyses using ai 6  tda 8  flexibility and rigidity index fri 43  and a large number of other network theory models 15  our results are summarized in table 3  the protein folding stability change following mutations is defined by g  g m  g w  where g w is the free energy change of the wild type and g m is the free energy change of the mutant type 6  the folding stability change g measures the difference between folded and unfolded states thus a negative g means the mutation causing destabilization and vice versa we use a tda-based deep learning method 6 to compute g in this work as shown in table 3  a negative folding stability change g is found for the mutation indicating a destabilizing mutation l37f for nsp6 physically a large hydrophobic residue f at the lipid bilayer and solvent interface reduces nsp6 stability considering the sequence alignment in figure 3 c we have also carried a similar calculation for the mutation of l37v and found its g  071 kcalmol therefore leucine is favored at residue position 37 for sars-cov-2 nsp6 next the fri rigidity index r  measures the geometric compactness and topological connectivity of the network consisting of c  at each residue and the heavy atoms involved in the mutation 43  the scale parameter  determines the range of pairwise interactions in this work the parameter  is set to 8 as shown in table 3  the increase in the fri rigidity index r  is found indicating the increase in the rigidity of the first alpha helix of nsp6 it is known that protein flexibility is required to allow it to function through molecular interactions within the cell among cells and even between organisms 37  the quadruplet phenylalanine resulting from mutation l37f can significantly reduce nsp6s interactions with er moreover seven network models 15 are utilized to analyze the l37f mutation in nsp6 as shown in table 3  we consider the network of heavy atoms at residue 37 and c  atoms in nsp6 the connections are allowed between any pair of atoms within a cutoff distance of 80 the mutation-induced decrease in the edge density d is due to the factor that the mutation increases the edge on the surface of the protein the mutation induced the decrease in the average path length l is owing to the mutation increases the edge with shorter distances the mutation induced the decrease in average betweenness centrality c b is due to the increase in the crowd of vertices by the mutation residue the mutation induced the increase in average eigencentrality c e is because increase in the number of the connected components will enlarge the maximal eigenvalues the mutation induced the increase in the average subgraph centrality c s is due to the decrease in the average participating rate of each edge the mutation induced the decrease in average communicability m is due to the decrease in the neighbor edges participating rate of each edge finally the mutation induced the increase in average communicability angle  is due to the increase in the alignments among different edges together with the fri rigidity index and the protein folding stability table 3  the folding stability change and graph network descriptor

formation mechanism and virological characteristics of asymptomatic infections this work parses 20656 complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 and for the first time reveals the relationship between asymptomatic cases and a single nucleotide mutation 11083gt-l37f on nsp6 after genotyping 83 sequences with asymptomatic and symptomatic records we find 11083gt is significantly relevant to the asymptomatic infection by analyzing the distribution of 11083gt in various countries we unveil that the 11083gt mutation correlates with the death ratio in singapore the united states the united kingdom etc inferring the correlation between the asymptomatic infection and the hypotoxicity of sars-cov-2 moreover we track the dynamics of 11083gt mutation ratio globally and discover its decaying tendency indicating that 11083gt mutation hinders sars-cov-2 transmission furthermore the analysis of the distribution of 11083gt in different ages and genders unveils that 11083gt-driven mutation does not have a host-dependent behavior the protein-specific analysis is also taken into consideration the 11083gt mutation leads leucine l residue at position 37 of nsp6 changing to phenylalanine f by employing the graph network analysis and topology-based mutation predictor we find that 11083gt-l37f destabilizes the structure of nsp6 in protein-wise as one of the most conservative proteins of sars-cov-2 nsp6 involves in the viral autophagic regulation therefore this destabilized mutation may result in the inefficiency of nsp6 to participate in the viral protein folding viral assembly and replication cycle which underpins our deduction that 11083gt-l37f may be relevant to the asymptomatic infections and weaken the sars-cov-2 virulence bristol-myers squibb and pfizer the authors thank

the visualization of four nsp6 proteoforms of sars-cov bat-sl-ratg bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-bm48-31 these proteoforms are consistent with that of sars-cov-2 described in the main paper indicating their similar function of regulating cell autophagy  e f figure 5  network analysis of the sars-cov-2 nsp6 l37f mutation the networks consist of heavy atoms of mutation site 37 and c atoms of

analysis of the sars-cov-2 l37f mutation the networks are constructed by heavy atoms at the mutation site and at the c  atoms of sars-cov-2 nsp6 figures 5 a b  c and d present the mutation-induced differences of fri rigidity index differences eigencentrality differences subgraph centrality differences and betweenness respectively although these descriptors do not change much globally their local changes around the mutation site reveal the l37f mutation-induced stress around the mutation site figures 5 e and f show the dependence of relative changes over cutoff distances first of all every descriptor converges as the cutoff distance increase relative changes do not fluctuate for cutoff distance greater than 24 the relative change of fri rigidity index monotonically decreases in absolute value as the cutoff increases similarly the edge density has a monotonically decreasing pattern the two networks are close in the path length descriptor interestingly betweenness centrality descriptor has the largest difference at 10 cutoff distance while the eigencentrality descriptor has the largest difference at 22 cutoff distance for betweenness centrality it shows that the mutation has the largest impact in the network of c  within 10 to any atoms of the target residue in figure 5 f three descriptors show a similar pattern -they increase in absolute value first and then decrease eventually as the cutoff increases overall the relative change plots indicate that the mutation happening at l37 has the largest impact on the c  within 10 to any atoms of the target residue on january 5 2020 the complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was first released on genbank access number nc 0455122 by zhangs group at fudan university 42  since then there has been a rapid accumulation of sars-cov-2 genome sequences in this work 20656 complete genome sequences with high coverage of sars-cov-2 strains from the infected individuals in the world were downloaded from the gisaid database 35  httpswwwgisaidorg as of june 19 2020 all the records in gisaid without the exact submission date were not taken into considerations to rearrange the 20656 complete genome sequences according to the reference sars-cov-2 genome multiple sequence alignment msa is carried out by using clustal omega 36 with default parameters the amino acid sequence of nsp6 is downloaded from genbank 3  the three-dimensional 3d structure of nonstructure protein 6 nsp6 in this work is generated by i-tasser model 44  the 3d structure graph is created by using pymol 11  single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping measures the genetic variations between different members of a species establishing the snp genotyping method to the investigation of the genotype changes during the transmission and evolution of sars-cov-2 is of great importance 38 45  by analyzing the rearranged genome sequences snp profiles which record all of the snp positions in teams of the nucleotide changes and their corresponding positions can be constructed the snp profiles of a given sars-cov-2 genome isolated from a covid-19 patient capture all the differences from a complete reference genome sequence and can be considered as the genotype of the individual sars-cov-2 in this work the prediction of nsp6 folding energy changes upon mutation is computed by using the topology based mutation predictor tml-mp  httpsweilabmathmsuedutmltml-mp which is briefly reviewed as following and its detail can be found in the literature 6  tml-mp applies element specific persistent homology which reveals essential biological information 8 14  the method employs the element-specific persistent homology 7 and other biological and chemical properties as machine learning features to train gradient boosted regression tree gbrt models the dataset includes 2648 mutations instances in 131 proteins provided by dehouck et al 10  the error analysis based on the dataset is given as pearson correlations coefficient r p  of 079 and root mean square error rmse of 091 kcalmol from previous work 6  as the persistent homology widely applied in a variety of practical feature generation problems it is also successful in the implementation of predictions of protein folding energy changes upon mutation the key idea in tml-mp is to use the element-specific persistent homology esph which distinguishes different element types of biomolecules when building persistent homology barcodes for instance commonly occurring protein element types include c n o s and h however hydrogen atoms are often absent from pdb data and sulfur atoms are too few in most proteins to be statistically important thus c n and o elements are considered on the esph in protein characterization as for persistent homology barcodes generated based on esph provide a topological representation of molecular interactions features are extracted from the different dimensions of persistent homology barcodes by dividing barcodes into several equally spaced bins which is called binned barcode representation the auxiliary features such as geometry electrostatics amino acid types composition and amino acid sequence are also included for machine learning training the element specific persistent homology is built by adopting the distance function dia i  a j  describing the distance between two atoms a i and a j defined as where loc denotes the location of an atom which is either in a mutant site or in the rest of the protein and de  is the euclidean distance between the two atoms then the persistent homology uses simplicial complexes with a specific rule such as vietoris-rips complex cech complex or alpha complex vietoris-rips complex vc is used for characterizing first-order interaction where alpha complex ac is used for characterizing higher-order patterns using esph to characterize interactions of different kinds we construct persistent homology barcodes on the atom sets by selecting one certain type of atoms in mutation site and one other certain type of atoms in the rest of the protein the set of barcodes from one persistent homology computation as v pdb  where  p  vc ac is the complex rule  d  di de is the distance function    m w is the protein of mutant type or wild type    cno is the element type selected in proteins except in the mutation site    cno is the element type selected in the mutation residue these barcodes are capable of reflecting the molecular mechanism of protein stability features are extracted from the groups of persistent homology barcodes for 18 groups of betti-0 esph barcode such that 9 groups are from the mutant type and 9 groups are from the wild type one can specify a fixed length interval to divide the esph barcodes into a number of equally spaced bins for example a length set 0 05 05 1  55 6 would turn the 18 groups of betti-0 esph barcode into 1812 features with dimension of the number of atoms the death and birth of bars are counted in each bin resulting in features therefore this representation enables us to precisely characterize hydrogen bonds van der waals electrostatic hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions for the higher-order betti numbers the emphasis is given on patterns of both short and long-distance scales statistics feature are computed for each group of barcodes for betti-1 and betti-2 which are sum max and the average of bar length and max and min of birth and death values overall 1218 features are generated by betti-0 on vc and 7218 features are generated by betti-1 and betti-2 on ac in tml-mp gradient boosted regression trees gbrts 22 are employed to train the dataset according to the size of the training dataset absence of model overfitting non-normalization of features and ability of nonlinear properties the gbrt method produces a prediction model as an ensemble method which is a class of machine learning algorithms it builds a popular module for regression and classification problems from weak learners by the assumption that the individual learners are likely to make different mistakes the method uses a summation of the weak learners to eliminate the overall error furthermore a decision tree is added to the ensemble depending on the current prediction error on the training dataset therefore this method is relatively robust against hyperparameter tuning and overfitting especially for data with a moderate number of features the gbrt is shown for its robustness against overfitting good performance for moderately small data sizes and model interpretability the current work uses the package provided by scikit-learn v 0230 33  the graph network descriptors are briefly presented which are applied in this work graph networks can mimic interactions between pairs of units in molecules the quantify features of the networks can reveal the biological and chemical properties measured by comparing descriptors on different networks to detect the single residue impact following mutation the network consists of a set sr of c  atoms from every residue of protein structure except the target mutation residue where r is the cutoff distance such that a c  atom is included if it is within r to any atom of the target mutation the total atom set t r is defined as the atoms c n and o of the target residue and c  atoms of sr moreover two vertices are connected in the network if their distance is less than 8 thus the adjacency matrix a can be defined as well where a is a matrix containing 0 and 1 such that ai j  0 if i-th and j-th are disconnected and ai j  1 if i-th and j-th are connected fri rigidity index was introduced to reflect the flexibility between atoms for molecular interaction prediction 29 43  the single residue molecular rigidity index measures its influence on the set sr which is given as where n s is the number of c  atoms of the set sr and n is the number of atoms in total atom set t r edge density is defined based on the adjacency matrix of the total atom set t r such as where i t is the index set of the mutation residue average path length measures the separation between two vertices of the whole network which can be used to study infectious diseases spreading in the networks 39  the average path length for the single mutation system of biomolecular is defined as where di j is the shortest path length between vertices v i and v j  average betweenness centrality shows communications in a network 21  the average betweenness centrality is given as where g k ij is defined as the number of the shortest path between vertices v i and v j that passes v k  and g ij is the number of shortest paths between v i and v j  average egeincentrality is the average of elements of the eigenvector v max  which is corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix 5 such as average subgraph centrality is built on the exponential of the adjacency matrix e  e a  the subgraph centrality is the summation of weighted closed walks of all lengths starting and ending at the same node 15 18  thus the average subgraph centrality reveal the average of participating rate of each vertex in all subgraph which is given as average communicability is defined in a similar way as the subgraph centrality on the exponential of the adjacency matrix 15 16 17  which is average communicability angle is given by 17  where i j  cos 1   comparative analysis of protein synthesis rate in covid-19 with other human coronaviruses chandra dasari mohan raju bhukya   the outbreak of coronavirus 2019 covid-19 pandemic has lead to a global emergency by affecting nearly 64 million people to date the 2019-ncov causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome called as sars-cov-2 which infects the respiratory tract of humans association et al 2020 there is no known vaccine and anti-viral treatment primary treatment is based on symptoms and support therapy covs are family of viruses classified into two groups as common human covs and other human covs 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 are common human covs that pose less threat to humans whereas other human covs like sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are evolved from animals and were transmitted to humans which pose a greater threat to humans health et al 2013 mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are zoonotic in nature as they are originated from animals and transmitted to humans covs can infect only certain cells of the specific host of particular species host specificity is the number and identity of host species which are used by parasites viruses the molecular basis for host specificity indicates that a surface molecule called viral receptor needs to be located on surface of host for virus to bind the host specificity of different covs not only limits to humans but also for various animals bats camels pigs and dogs the viruses use host receptors as an entry point to invade human cells and use their machinery to reproduce such cells are called permissive zedalis and eggebrecht 2018 in humans angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 ace2 acts as the host receptor for 2019-ncov sars-cov and nl63 hoffmann et al 2020 dipeptidyl peptidase iv dpp4 for mers-cov li 2015 aminopeptidase n hapn for 229e li 2015 nacetyl-9-o-acetylneuraminic acid neu59ac2 for oc43 and o-acetylated sialic acid for hku1 krempl et al 1995 covs are positive-stranded dna or rna genomes present inside a protein shell called nucleocapsid n along with two membrane proteins namely membrane m envelope e and one glycoprotein spike s siddell et al 2010 the s protein attaches the virion to the receptor ace2 of the host cell by initiating the infection owing to drastic changes li 2016 it is vulnerable to mutations on the receptor interface to defend the host immunity sui et al 2014 the e protein forms protein-lipid pores and also acts as a channel for ion transport ruch and machamer 2012 the mprotein plays a vital role in enhancing virus rna transcription and helps in biosynthesis of the virus neuman et al 2011 the n protein is the most stable and conserved multifunctional protein that interacts with m protein during virion assembly and controls the host cells by intoxicating cell machinery mcbride et al 2014 dna viruses use proteins and enzymes of host cell to develop new virus dna later that is transcribed to messenger rna the viral mrna controls the host cell to synthesize its proteins and enzymes the genetic code defines the relationship between codons and amino acids sequence of the protein during translation mrna is read and decode for proteins that contain a chain of amino acids or polypeptides the translation process is carried out in three stages initiation elongation and termination ribosomes and transfer rna trna are two molecules play a major role during the translation process in the initiation stage ribosomes sit around the mrna strand and the first trna carrying the amino acid and the anti-codon interacts with a start codon atg of the mrna template to start the translation during translation elongation the amino acid chain grows longer as each time a new codon is encountered mrna binds with matching anti-codon of its cognate trna on the a-site of the ribosome the existing polypeptide chain links onto the amino acid of trna on p-site via a chemical reaction then mrna is shifted one codon to make room for new codon to decode finally in the termination stage decoding stops when stop codons tag taa or tga are encountered and finished polypeptide chain is released based on the behaviour of antisense molecules new anti-viral drugs have been discovered stein et al 2001 antiviral drugs stall the translation process thereby stopping the protein synthesis of the virus and end its replication there are 64 codons 61 codons for decoding and remaining 3 used as stop codons to terminate translation which code for 20 amino acids in protein synthesis the translation process has become complicated because more than one codon decodes the same amino acid such codons are referred as synonymous codons this state of genetic code is indicated as degeneracy of the codons gonzalez et al 2019 various studies revealed that the selection of synonymous codons is a non-random procedure plotkin and kudla 2011 sharp et al 2010 in translation some codons are preferred over other synonymous codons is known to be codon usage bias or codon bias some unknown codons or combination of codons influence the translation rate and efficiency such codons act as rate-limiting factors moreover it is difficult to comprehend how much difference in translation rate affects the gene expression brule and grayhack 2017 depending upon the species usually there are 40 to 60 different types of trnas with its anti-codon and matching amino acid exists in a cell the codon usage pattern analysis in various covs may provide useful insights in the synonymous codon usage and host-adapted evolutionary process the ribosome decodes the 61 codons to 20 amino acids at non-uniform rate is referred as codon optimality hanson and coller 2018 it acts as a strong cognitive factor for translation rates the corresponding genes seems to be have inherent codon bias the influence of codon optimality on the translation rate remains a topic of potent debate novoa and de pouplana 2012 the concern debate on codon optimality focused much around the influence of codon bias on translation efficiency protein folding and translation fidelity more recent studies reveals that the codon optimality became an important determinant of translation elongation rate and mrna stability presnyak et al 2015 harigaya and parker 2016 radhakrishnan et al 2016 for over two decades it was assumed that various codons were translated at different rate it was evident that codon bias could affect the translation elongation speed by the use of a radio-labelled amino acid incorporation assay srensen and pedersen 1991 sometimes ribosomes are forced to wait for longer duration due to rare cognate trna to bind on ribosome a-site this situation leads to per-codon elongation rate as they are majorly dependent on trna pool koutmou et al 2015 the overhead of kinetic cost levied to elongation rate for filtering and rejecting the near-cognate trna species where the cognate trna are scarce chu et al 2011 the abundance of codon usage and trna increase the gene expression along with regulating ribosomal translation speed protein folding efficiency and gene expression functionalities novoa and de pouplana 2012 the recent emerging methods by monitoring translation in real time provides additional evidence for the influence of codon bias on translation elongation rates chekulaeva and landthaler 2016 iwasaki and ingolia 2016 codons without corresponding cognate trna are known as slow codons of the organism yang and chen 2020 the combination of two consecutive slow codons is called slow dicodons yang and chen 2020 the human genome contains 13 slow codons which have no cognate trna genes chan and lowe 2009 ribosomal experiments conducted in many studies show that decoding codons with non-cognate trnas and rare trnas greatly reduce the translation efficiency dana and tuller 2012 hussmann et al 2015 stadler and fire 2011 furthermore it was reported that the decoding efficiency of a particular codon is influenced by its subsequent codon two subsequent slow codons slow di-codons reduces translation rate chevance and hughes 2017 chevance et al 2014 conversely the low proportions of slow codons and slow di-codons may have rapid rate of translation in the mrna coding sequences cds viruses use the human host cell translation machinery for their protein translation therefore host-specific slow codons and slow di-codons proportions in the viral host sequences can be used to anticipate the order of translation rates between various viruses of different genera serotypes and strains human covs were first recognized in children during 1960 are responsible for upper respiratory tract infections in 1965 a virus b814 was discovered in adults and later renamed as 229e tyrrell et al 1966 later oc43 beta coronavirus was found which spreads over humans and cattle sars-cov first recognized in guangdong province china in november 2002 this infectious disease said to report 8000 cases with the death of 800 people according to the report by the world health organization who thereafter another coronavirus nl63 was found in 2004 that affect more severe lower respiratory or mild upper respiratory systems mostly common in younger children abdul-rasool and fielding 2010 in 2005 hku1 was identified as genetically distinct from oc43 and other covs kahn and mcintosh 2005 mers-cov was a zoonotic virus first identified in 2012 due to mers-cov nearly 35 of infected humans have deceased according to the report of who in december 2019 a novel coronavirus covid-19 which is homologous with sars-cov has created havoc worldwide infecting 64 million people in more than 200 countries till 05-06-2020 in this study we analyzed comprehensively various characteristics of seven different covs which includes codon usage bias the enc rscu proportions of slow codons and slow di-codons mutation bias cai codon frequencies and at1-at3 and gc1gc3 count all these factors influence the translational rate and efficiency we aim to interpret the codon patterns of these seven covs concerning the host relation the major highlights of this study include1the proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons of 2019-ncov and sars-cov found to be similar and very less compared to the other five coronavirus types which suggest that the 2019-ncov has faster protein synthesis rate2the zoonotic nature covs 2019-ncov sars-cov and mers-cov has fewer number of negatively biased average rscu value 06 codons than four human covs which implies the high translation rate in zoonotic viruses3most of the covs isolates and its clusters fall under the standard curve which strengthen the role of directional mutation pressure and natural selection on codon bias respectively4it is observed that all the covs have more at than gc in genetic codon compositions the cai values of sars-cov and mers-cov are maximum so the rate of gene expression is high in these viruses5in mers-cov and nl63 we observed enormous silent missense and nonsense mutations whereas in 2019-ncov there are a little silent mutations and none nonsense mutations

 where nsc is the number of slow codons present in each virus coding sequence tc represents the total number of codons and n represents the total number of coronavirus cds the proportion of human slow di-codons for a given coronavirus cds is calculated as follows6psdci1nnsdctc1where nsdc is the number of slow di-codons present in each virus coding sequence tc represents the total number of codons and n represents the total number of coronavirus cds a virus depends completely on the host cell machinery to replicate by undergoing a vital process of translation consequently the proportions of host-specific slow codons and slow di-codons can be considered to predict the order of the viral mrna protein synthesis rates of various viruses of different genus and strains lower the proportions of slow codons and slow di-codons may have fast translation rates in the covs cds mutations can occur randomly but all these mutations are not equally likely mutation bias indicates a portion of sequence in which particular type of mutation occur more frequenctly but the exact cause is unknown yampolsky and stoltzfus 2001 transition-transversion bias is a type of mutational bias substitution mutations are classified as transitions and transversions based on the structure the nucleotides a g and c t are called purines two-ring and pyrimidines one-ring respectively the transition mutation occurs due to mutations among purines ag and pyrimidines ct hence the mutation involves between similar shape keller et al 2007 whereas in transversions the mutations occur between purine a g and pyrimidine c t bases therefore in transversions the mutations involve exchange of bases between one-ring and two-ring structures the number of possible choices in transversions is relatively higher than transitions even though the transitions are at higher frequency than transversions transitions acts as silent substitutions because of the wobble and have no observable effect on the organisms phenotype the transition and transversion mutations may cause a silent mutation if the mrna codon codes for synonymous codon for the same amino acid a missense mutation if the mrna codon generates for a different amino acid or a nonsense mutation if the mrna codon produce a stop codon the most widespread measure cai is used to analyze codon usage bias unlike other measures cai calculates the deviation of a given coding sequence regarding a reference set of protein-coding sequences relative adaptiveness wi for each amino acid in a coding sequence is computed from a reference coding sequence set7wifimaxfiwhere fi is the frequency of the synonymous codon and fj indicates the most frequent synonymous codon of particular amino acid cai of a coding gene is expressed as the geometric mean of the weight corresponding to each codon over the gene sequence of length l jansen et al 20038caii1lwi1l
 cai is a quantitative measure used to estimate the level of gene expression by considering the codon usage sequence sharp and li 1987 the parameters considered in coding sequences of different coronaviruses to determine codon bias are the frequency composition of g  c base in first gc1 second gc2 and third gc3 positions in codons and the composition of a  t base at at1 at2 at3 positions the codon usage patterns are peculiar to family genus and even at the species level of viruses to analyze this specificity rscu values for 59 relevant codons that code for 18 essential amino acids 90 was determined for all the cds of varied covs the frequency of each codon type is measured by using a codon usage package of sequence manipulation suite stothard 2000 three stop codons taa tag tga and two codons atg tgg which uniquely code for methionine and tryptophan amino acids respectively are not included in rscu analysis synonymous codon usage scu bias is a unique trait in many organisms wong et al 2010 and has been noted in various viruses mcbride et al 2014 sui et al 2014 yang and chen 2020 as the coronavirus depends on the host cell factory for its duplication synonymous codon usage bias plays a crucial role in virion assembly and mrna translation of the virus to analyze scu bias rscu is used and its values of 59 relevant codons that possibly show bias in their usage were examined for different coronavirus as listed in table 2
 based on the codon usage the synonymous codon rscu values are categorized into five groups i the rscu value of 10 indicates unbiased codons it means that particular codon has not shown a sign of bias for that amino acid and codon are chosen equally likely ii the synonymous codons whose rscu value greater than 10 indicates that it has positive codon usage bias and are termed as preferred codons iii rscu value less than 10 represents that codon has negative usage bias and indicated as less preferred iv if the rscu value is greater than 16 the codons are treated as over-preferred and v the codons with rscu values less than 06 are treated as under-preferred wong et al2010 identified the average rscu values of eight codons that belongs to seven amino acids gtt val cct pro gct ala tct ser act thr ggt gly aga arg and cgt arg are over-preferred in all covs the amino acids ser and ala are under-preferred with tcg gcg in all covs and amino acids arg gly with cgg ggg are under-preferred in all except mers-cov in both 2019-ncov and sars-cov have 13 codons ctt lue gtt val tct ser tca ser cct pro cca pro act thr aca thr gct ala cgt arg aga arg agg arg and ggt gly are over-preferred which represent the commonality between these two viruses the strong deficiency of cpg sites are the consequence of almost all the rscu values 05 of cgnncg codons in all covs to avoid congenital immune responses generally rna viruses maintain cpg suppression the 2019-ncov and sars-cov have the fewer number six of negatively biased codons than other covs 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 that have largely negative biased codons 17 24 24 and 16 respectively the 2019-ncov has 40 preferred codons 06  average rscu 16 and 13 over-preferred average rscu 16 which may implies a higher protein synthesis rate the average proportions of human slow codons and slow dicodons are extracted from 4143 cds of seven different covs as shown in table 3
 non-repeated slow codon proportion is the ratio between unique slow codons to unique non-slow codons repeated slow codon proportion is calculated as in eq 5 in overlapped slow di-codons any two consecutive slow codons are paired in a coding sequence and form slow di-codons whereas in non-overlapped slow di-codons a slow codon that is paired with consecutive slow codon doesnt pair with other immediate right consecutive slow codons the proportion of slow di-codons is calculated using eq 6 the order of average proportion of repeated slow codons is 2019-ncov 0174  sars-cov 0176  mers-cov 0215  229e 0220  oc43 0232  hku1 0245  nl63 0249 and non-overlapped slow di-codons is 2019-ncov 0033  sars-cov 0034  mers-cov 0059  229e 0062  oc43 0067  hku1 0079  nl63 0089 as shown in fig 1
 the average proportion order of overlapped slow di-codons are 2019-ncov 0027  sars-cov 0029  229e 0049  mers-cov 0049  oc43 0056  hku1 0061  nl63 0071 the proportion of slow codons and slow di-codons is inversely proportional to protein synthesis rate yang and chen 2020 so the protein translation rates of different covs are as shown 2019-ncov  sars-cov  mers-cov  229e  oc43  hku1  nl63 the number of slow codons and slow di-codons are very less in 2019-ncov that suggest the protein synthesis rate of 2019-ncov is more than other types of covs the protein synthesis rate is proportional to the rate of virus replication which indicates the rapid spread of infection in humans we performed mutation analysis of three coronavirus nl63 mers-cov and 2019-ncov dna sequences and examine the transformations of slow codons and non-slow codons due to mutations a sample of mutations found in the various dna sequences are shown in table 4
and the complete set of mutations and its analysis can found at the supplementary material we identified and analyzed transition transversion silent missense and nonsense mutations at codon level in cds that reveals the genetic diversity of various covs the mutation rate in 2019-ncov is very less compare with mers-cov and nl63 in 2019-ncov we pointed out silent and missense mutations whereas in other two covs nonsense mutations are also recognized in mers-cov and nl63 silent mutations are very high compare with 2019-ncov the mutation rates in 2019-ncov dna strains of human collected from countries like usa greece brazil and srilanka have higher than the china india and south africa due to point mutations at codon level the transformation of slow codons to non-slow codons found to be high that may impact the protein synthesis rate the results provide evidence for genetic diversity and fast evolution of new corona viruses the enc regulate the degree of preference of the codons in the process of decoding enc ranges between 20 and 61 codons and inversely correlated with codon bias high enc values indicate that the cds are highly conserved and represent effective duplication the enc value less than or equal to 35 represents strong codon usage bias sheikh et al 2020 the enc value greater than 35 represents slight codon bias because of mutational pressure or nucleotide compositional constraints the average enc values of seven types of covs are ranged from 38364955 as shown in the table 5
 this infers that all these covs with high enc values use preferred codons and easily get adapted to the host cell generally the average enc for codon sequences of viruses are between 389 and 583 jenkins and holmes 2003 the enc plots enc vs gc3 are constructed to investigate the role of directional mutation pressure on codon usage bias in the genes of seven covs in the enc-gc3 plot almost all the points corresponding to the covs lies under the standard curve as shown in fig 2
 the sars-cov and 2019-ncov host sequences clustered far below the standard curve stipulating a high codon bias having a notable correlation with gene expression most of the covs isolates and its clusters fall under the standard curve which strengthen the role of directional mutation pressure and natural selection on codon bias respectively the correlation values are from r  000002 mers-cov to 0743 hku1-cov the correlation values of hku1 nl63 sars-cov and 2019-ncov between enc and gc3 have a high significance p  05 disclosing the impact of mutational bias the following parameters are considered in cds of different covs to determine codon biases the frequencies of g  c and a  t at various positions of all codons are determined and listed in the table 5 in all covs studied in this work the composition of g  c and a  t frequency percentage order is gc3  gc2  gc1  at1  at2  at3 hence the covs have more at than the gc the genetic codon composition of seven covs is shown in fig 3
 2019-ncov and sars-cov has similar codon compositions and also hku1 nl63 have similar codon compositions the codons aat aaa act att gct and the slow codons ggt ttt gat have the highest codon compositions the analysis reveals the novel information that the slow codon composition in 229e hku1 nl63 oc43 and mers-cov are higher than sars-cov 2019-ncov hence 2019-ncov and sars-cov have a higher translation rate than other covs cai for each gene of seven covs is measured and the minimum mean maximum average cai values are listed in table 6
 the strong correlation exists between the cai and the level of gene expression sharp and li 1987 gene expression level has a direct impact on the rate of protein evolution in various organisms pagan et al 2012 the order of the average cai values are 229e  nl63  hku1  2019-ncov  oc43  sars-cov  mers-cov the cai values for each codon of seven covs are calculated and listed in table 7
 the codons aaa aca att aga caa cca gaa gga gtt tat ttt and tgt have highest cai value for all seven covs 2019-ncov and sars-cov have similar cai values in which the codons aac agt cac gac gct tta shows highest values we constructed phylogenetic tree to analyze the evolutionary relationships among the seven covs using the maximum likelihood statistical method with tamura-nei model which is implemented in the mega-x kumar et al 2018 to determine the robustness of the tree nodes we performed bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates of dataset the complete host sequences of seven covs were put to phylogenetic analysis and generated individual trees along with combined tree in case of combine tree two separate clusters were formed where one indicating human covs and other represents zoonotic nature covs the combined tree suggests the diversity in various covs as shown in fig 4
 the individual phylogentic trees of different covs suggest diversified structures as shown in supplementary material this analysis indicated that 2019-ncov belongs to beta coronavirus and shares the common ancestor with sars-cov the protein synthesis rate depends on the selection of synonymous codons codon usage bias translation initiation trna availability and ribosome binding the accurate calculation of codon usage bias is vital to understand the genetic variations and allows comparison among different covs in this study we evaluated various measures that manifest the importance of codon bias in translation rate we assessed seven covs with various parameters to determine the correlation among them analysis of slow codons and slow di-codons proportions states a relation between viral mrna genes and viral protein synthesis rate in host cells we have observed the zoonotic nature covs 2019-ncov sars-cov have great transmission potential and easily adaptable to host cells than human covs the enc plot the correlation values of hku1 nl63 sarscov and 2019-ncov have a high significance p  05 disclosing the impact of mutational bias the sars-cov and 2019-ncov host sequences clustered far below the standard curve stipulating a high codon bias having a notable correlation with gene expression moreover the mutation rate in 2019-ncov is very less compare with mers-cov and nl63 in 2019-ncov we pointed out silent and missense mutations whereas in other two covs nonsense mutations are also recognized in mers-cov and nl63 silent mutations are very high compare with 2019-ncov due to the limitation of data further investigation and analysis are possible on frame shift mutation rates of sars-cov-2 further deep learning techniques can be used to predict patterns

nucleotide numbers were indicated starting from the 5 utr of the viral sequence while amino acid positions were indicated separately for each corresponding protein coding region4 the positions of the nucleotides and amino acids were further confirmed from genebank reference sequences nc04551214 the nonconserved nucleotide positions were determined and the nucleotide substitutions were evaluated for their effects on amino acid changes by using the aliview and mega software the age interval of the patients from turkey from whom the viral isolates were taken was between 19 and 82 41 of the patients were between the age range of 4160 while 29 was between 19 and 40 and 28 was between 61 and 80 figure 1a and the sex distribution was approximately equal figure 1b most of the uploaded samples seem to come from middle-west side of the country figure 1c  when the sars-cov-2 strains from turkey compared to the reference viral sequence nc 0455121 some missense and silent mutations were identified in more than 40 of the viral isolates one or more of nucleotide substitutions of c3037t c14408t a23403g and g25563t were observed which are present in the coding regions for the nsp3 rna-dependent rna polymerase spike glycoprotein and orf3a protein respectively table 1 among these mostly seen substitutions the ones seen in nsp3 rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike glycoprotein were present in 61 3862 of the isolates from turkey other viral genome regions where the nucleotide substitutions were observed in 5 or more samples out of 62 include nsp6 2462 3 to 5 exonuclease 2262 nsp2 2262 nucleocapsid protein 2162 membrane glycoprotein 1362 nsp4 1162 nsp3 662 and helicase 562 table 1 each of the 62 viral isolates were also evaluated by means of the mutations they harbor and 24 viral isolates found to have unique mutations in addition to the common mutations they harbor that are not seen in other isolates from turkey table 2 supplementary table 2 most of the viral isolates found to have different nucleotide substitution combinations however the same nucleotide substitutions were observed for the samples epiisl42874 and epiisl429871 simlarly epiisl437411 and epiisl437413 were also found to have the same nucleotide substitution combination among them supplementary table 2 the analyzed viral isolates were found to harbor 4 to12 mutations per isolate compared to the reference sequence supplementary table 2 c  t mutations also observed to predominate among the analyzed viral isolates the first covid-19 case in turkey was declared in march 11th almost after two and a half months from the first case declaration in china when the nucleotide substitutions for the sars-cov-2 isolates in turkey were analyzed compared to the reference genome of the virus from china it was seen that during this time period the virus had undergone several nucleotide substitutions including silent and missense mutations when we consider the mutations in orf1ab nucleotide substitutions of c884t g1397a c3037t g8653t g11083t c14408t and c18877t were seen in more than 15 1162 of the samples c14408t mutation within the rna-dependent rna polymerase encoding region of orf1b which is a missense mutation that leads to an amino acid change from proline to leucine at position 323 p323l in rna polymerase protein was amongst the most commonly seenmutations 61 3862 in isolates from turkey both amino acids seem to have similar isoelectric points and this mutation is mostly seen in isolates from europe followed by north america pachetti et al 2020 the mutation was found to be present in european isolates after february 20th 2020 and thought to be associated with increased number of point mutations compared to isolates from asia which proposed to be somehow due to the presence of rna polymerase within the proofreading machinery of the virus pachetti et al 2020 a recent study indicates that sars-cov-2 genomes which harbor c14408t mutation are more likely to have mutations in the membrane m and envelope e proteins eskier et al 2020 furthermore recently revealed structure of the replicating rna polymerase of sars-cov-2 may further help to understanding of the effect of certain mutations within this protein hillen et al 2020 g11083t corresponding to the amino acid substitution l37f within nsp6 protein was present in 38 of the samples 2462 and this mutation was previously seen in sars-cov-2 sequences analyzed from all over the world benvenuto et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in the study of wang et al 2020 c8782t substitution which is also a silent mutation was present in 28 out of 95 samples although this mutation was only present in 2 samples epiisl428718 and epiisl437317 in our study which indicates that this mutation is not as common as in europe for the viral isolates in turkey and may be related with isolates from other countries both c8782t and g11083t mutations were found to be mostly present in oceania isolates where followed by north america and europe subsequently pachetti et al 2020 g1397a substitution in nsp2 encoding region of orf1a which was present in 33 2162 of the isolates was mainly seen in viral isolates from oceania however was also present in minor amounts in isolates from asia and north america pachetti et al 2020 this substitution leads to an amino acid change from valine to isoleucine at the position 198 v198i within nsp2 protein where both amino acids have the same isoelectric points  a23403g mutation in the spike glycoprotein coding region was also amongst the mostly seen mutations in viral isolates from turkey 61 spike glycoprotein functions to bind target receptor and facilitate membrane fusion and viral entry ou et al 2020 this protein has 2 subunits s1 and s2 where the former mediates attachment and the later mediates membrane fusion a23403g substitution was found to be present in isolates from europe and leads to an amino acid change from aspartate to glycine at position 614 d614g within the spike glycoprotein where these amino acids differ by means of their isoelectric points pachetti et al 2020 another mutation found within the spike protein encoding region was c22444t which is a silent mutation and seen in 7 out of 62 isolates table 1 similar to sars-cov receptor binding domain rbd within the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 seems to play a major role in viral infection by acting as an interaction point with target receptors on the host cell surface raj et al 2013 in a recent study which performed multivariate generalized linear model glm analysis with outpatient and hospitalized patients in the sheffield teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust as the outcome revealed that patients carrying g614 mutation had higher viral loads compared to d614 although d614g status did not significantly affect the hospitalization status korber et al 2020 it also seems that the viral isolates which carry d614g mutation increases in number across the world and this mutation was proposed to have effect on the viral infectivity either due to its presence on the spike protein promoter surface region which might affect hydrogen bonding properties with neighbouring promoter regions or due to be in a site surrounded by antibody-dependent enhancement targets where antibody binding may lead to a confirmational change that might increase the ace2 interaction both mechanisms were proposed to play role in a more transmissible form of the virus korber et al 2020 on the other hand another study perfomed on 15000 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that the recurrent mutations do not increase transmissibility dorp et al 2020 therefore the effect of d614g mutation on the transmission of the virus is still a debate  five out of 27 commonly seen mutations in viral isolates from turkey were within the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein one interesting finding was the presence of 2 subsequent missense mutations that are seen as a cluster in 9 out of 62 samples 14  these mutations were due to nucleotide substitutions in 3 nucleotides in order where 2 of them g28881a and g28882a results in arginine to lysine r203k substitution and the third one g28883c results in glycine to arginine g204r in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein where both substituted amino acids differ from their original amino acids in means of their isoelectric points pachetti et al 2020 table 1 g28881a along with a23403g substitution in spike glycoprotein seems to have occurred after february 16th 2020 in europe pachetti et al 2020 c28854t substitution in the nucleocapsid protein coding region which leads to an amino acid change s194l was another missense mutation that also was seen in 695 samples in a previous study where 95 sequences from different countries were evaluated wang et al 2020 these findings support the presence of the mutation in several strains all over the world including some isolates from turkey in addition to s protein nucleocapsid protein was also proposed to be important in covid-19 infectivity goh et al 2020 further studies are needed to clarify if the missense mutations within this region can be important in the infection strategy of the sars-cov-2 virus or not  g1397a t28688c and g29742t substitutions were said to belong to a monophyletic group which is defined by the presence of these 3 mutations and were found to present in patients who were traveled to or are residents in iran eden j et al 2020 as well as in australian and new zealand isolates twenty-one viral isolates from turkey harbor those 3 mutations together epiisl417413 epiisl424366 epiisl428722 epiisl428713 epiisl429872 epiisl429865 epiisl429868 epiisl437319 epiisl437324 epiisl437325 epiisl437326 epiisl437327 epiisl437332 epiisl437306 epiisl437307 epiisl437312 epiisl437314 epiisl437320 epiisl437321 epiisl437322 epiisl437323 epiisl437334 the travel history to iran were only mentioned for 6 samples in gisaid epiisl437319 epiisl437324 epiisl437325 epiisl437326 epiisl437327 epiisl437332 where 4 of them epiisl437319 epiisl437324 epiisl437325epiisl437327 are known to harbor this monophyletic group however other 2 samples do not harbor any of these mutations although they have travel history to iran identification of detailed epidemiological data of these samples can be important to identify if these patients somehow had contact in relation to any of these countries a phylogenetic network analysis of 160 sars-cov-2 genomes identified 3 central variants of the virus named as a b and c compared to the bat coronavirus forster et al 2020 these variants differ from each other by amino acid substitutions node a has 2 subclusters where there is t or c in nucleotide position 29095 b-type variant have t8782c nonsynonymous and c28144t synonymous leu to ser substitution in addition to a-type and c-type variant have g26144t synonymous mutation gly to val in addition to b-type substitutions a- and c-types are said to present mainly outside of east asia where b-type is said to be present mainly in east asia the isolates from turkey analyzed in this study mainly harbor cytosine in nucleotide position 29095 another study which analyzed 622 complete sars-cov-2 genomes by an unrooted maximum likelihood tree divided the viral genomes into 3 clusters which was mainly similar to the 3 viral variants identified in 162 sars-cov-2 genomes forster et al 2020 and performed linkage analysis between the mutations seen within these clusters bai et al 2020 according to the linkage analysis c241t c3037t c14408t and a23403g in cluster 3 were in complete linkage and the tttg haplotype was high in europe and correlated with the death rate in the viral isolates analyzed in this study c3037t c14408t and a23403g which were the most common mutations 61 exist together in 11 out of 62 samples c241t was also observed to be present together with c3037t c14408t and a23403g the reason of not observing c241t in linkage with other mutations with the same percentage can be due to the absence of the first 265 nucleotides in 25 of the uploaded sequences to gisaid however there are also isolates that harbor either c241t and not the other 3 mutations or vice versa this haplotype was proposed to be related with the high death rates in europe bai et al 2020 analyzing the course of the covid-19 disease in patients from whom the viral isolates were taken can give further information about the relatedness of this haplotype with the death rates in turkey apart from the common mutations when we consider mutations seen in a single sample among analyzed isolates some are not mentioned previously in the literature c8782t was previously seen in more than 10 isolates in guangdong province of china lu et al 2020 and proposed to be clade specific in a study performed on 313 sars-cov-2 genomes li li cui and wu 2020 g28878a which is present in the same isolate with c8782t was observed in isolates from australia and usa li et al 2020 some of the observed mutations can be either unique to corresponding isolate or can also be a result of homoplasy or sequencing artefact since in an ongoing study some sites within the viral genome are suspected to be homoplasic substitutions or sequencing artefacts66issues with sars-cov-2 sequencing data 2020 online website httpsvirologicalorgtissues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data473 accessed 5 may 2020 g11083t is the most common one among such sites across different countries and sequencing technologies which might be an indicator of this position being either a site for frequent mutation or an artefact however 38 of the samples 2462 analyzed in this study harbor this mutation although being sequenced by different technologies which is consistent with this site being a site for frequent mutation  some homoplasic sites were found to bespecific to certain sequencing technologies such as the nucleotide position 11074 nucleotide 3037 and 11074 were reported to be either artefacts or hypermutable low-fitness sites however 3037 was found to have a linkage with 3 other mutations and mainly observed in europe it is also among the mostly seen mutations along with 14408 and 23403 in the viral isolates analyzed therefore it can be 1 of the hypermutable sites within the viral genome apart from 11074 and 3037 detailed analysis of the identified unique mutations by means of possible sequencing artefacts and homoplasic sites can reveal more information about them therefore considering the possible sequencing artefacts while analyzing the sequences for substitution can be important korber et al 2020 recombination is known to take place in evolution of coronaviruses and some breakpoints for recombination in sars-cov-2 was also reported korber et al 2020 rehman et al 2020 therefore apart from single nucleotide mutations identification of possible recombinational events can be important in vaccine development strategies in our dataset 2 samples found to harbor quite lots of mutations which both are sequenced with the same sequencing technology therefore only the common mutations with other isolates in one of them were considered and the other one was excluded totally since the mutations it harbors were quite extreme the number of extreme mutations might be due to the use of separate sequencing technology in these strains compared to the other isolates that are analyzed in this study  the nucleotide substitutions showed that viral isolates from turkey are genetically close to the ones from europe middle east north america and asia c3037t c14408t and a23403g substitutions which are present in nsp3 rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike encoding regions respectively were found to be the mostly seen mutations in turkey sars-cov-2 isolates considering the missense mutations encountered in these isolates further studies are needed how the identified amino acid changes affect the structure of the related proteins as well as the infectivity and spread of the virus also the silent mutations within sars-cov-2 genome can be followed up to determine if any further missense mutations will take place within these regions which may be helpful to understand the evolutionary strategy of the virus as it continues to evolve during its spread through the world  the authors acknowledge to all the researchers in originating and submitting labs who have shared the sars-cov-2 genome data on gisaid httpwwwgisaidorg the extended acknowledgement can be found as a supplementary file no funding was used to conduct this research  investigating the genomic landscape of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov to identify non-synonymous mutations for use in diagnosis and drug design manish tiwari divya mishra   current and last two decades saw emergence of zoonotic coronavirus cov crossing the species barrier ultimately infecting human species resulting in pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 12 an apocalyptic threat is posed by a sempiternal pathogen ruining the health and the economies on global scale a severe pneumonia outbreak starting in december 2019 in the wuhan city hubei province china was caused by novel cov referred as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov 34 covs are rna viruses with wide host pathogenesis in mammals including humans pangolins and birds genetically the covs were categorised into four major genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 5 the alpha and beta covs infect mammals whereas the gamma and delta covs infect birds 6 primary symptoms associated with cov infection include respiratory hepatic enteric and neurological diseases previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of covs hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 sars-cov and mers-cov which can infect the human species hcov-nl63 hcov-229e belongs to alphacov genus while rest belongs to betacov genus 6 the betacovs appears to be prima-facie genre of covs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades recently the 2019-ncov outbreak spread from china to the intercontinental arena and already infected 03 million people globally claiming 13000 43 deaths till 21st march 2020 httpswwwworldometersinfocoronaviruscountries china and italy were the epicentres until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future genome sequence analysis of sars mers and 2019-ncov confirmed its presence in betacovs family and divergence from the other two viruses 4 the 2019-ncov is a positive-strand rna viruses with 29 kb genome size 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading frames orfs 7 viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins namely envelope e spike s membrane m and 35 nucleocapsid n proteins the genome starts with short untranslated regions 5 utr followed by genes 5-replicase rep gene s e m n and 3 utr 7 two-third of the genome is represented by the rep gene at 5 end which encodes for non-structural protein nsp spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre 89 viral assembly relies primarily on m and e proteins and rna synthesis is achieved by action of n protein 7 to mitigate the severity of 2019-ncov researchers around the world are trying to develop antibodies and vaccine against this deadly virus the problem with the delay in antiviral medication is superficial understanding of the virus a dire need is to unravel the mutations in the viral genome and concomitant amino acid changes occurring presumably due to varying geographical location or upon interaction with the diverse human immune system various reports compared the sars mers bat and pangolin coronaviruses and paved way for significant findings still leaving a lacunae in terms of the variations in the hcov genomes and comparison with the previous available viruses resources the present study deals with the mutations in the hcov genomes and resulting change in amino acids to analyse the phylogenetic relationship between different coronaviruses 591 genomes were downloaded from global initiative on sharing all influenza database gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg the hcov is an rna virus and the deposited sequences are in dna format to prevent anomaly in the data represented complete genomes and only high coverage datasets were utilized the genomic sequences were aligned using muscle program v3831 10 the alignments were utilized to deduce various nucleotide substitutions and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstrap was constructed by raxml program 11 the alignment and tree were visualized using jalview 2110 12 and itol respectively 13 different substitutions and resulting amino acid changes were analyzed between human bat pangolin and sars coronavirus genomes to deduce a mutation or amino acid change only those confirmed in three individual genomes were considered replicates for biological significance genomic features may provide an important clue about the relatedness and evolution of the organism in order to get an insight into the similitude and dissimilitude between human novel coronavirus hcov and other coronaviruses the genome sequence of human novel coronavirus hcov were compared with bat coronavirus gu1902151 14 severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus strain btky72 ky3524071 15 bat sars-like coronavirus isolate bat-sl-covzc45 mg7729331 16 hcov-19pangolinguangdong12019epi isl 410721 pangolin-hcov and hcov-19batyunnanratg132013epi isl bat-hcov which revealed approximately 81 81 89 90 and 96 similarity respectively table 1
 to further assess the relationship between hcov and other coronaviruses alignment and phylogenetic analysis was carried out alignment of hcov with above mentioned viruses showed that several nucleotide sites were unique in hcov sequences when compared to other coronaviruses table s1 among these sites ct hcov other coronavirus is the most prevalent substitution followed by tc ga and ag table s1 many regions were absent in bat and sars coronavirus genome when compared to hcov bat-hcov and pangolin-hcov among these regions one of largest portion is of 391 nt 28026-28417 coding for orf8 protein in hcov putatively involved in interspecies transmission 17 genomic similarities and alignment indicate that several mutation events over the time is responsible for emergence of human novel coronavirus further a phylogenetic analysis between these viruses displayed that hcovs are closer to batsars-like virus mg7729331 and distant from sars coronavirus ky3524071 and bat coronavirus gu1902151 fig 1
 these results demonstrate that sars coronavirus and bat coronavirus gu1902151 could be apparent ancestor of other coronaviruses studied in the investigation scrutiny of nucleotide and amino acid in coding region of the genome revealed that the hcov genome share 9267 and 9692 similarity at nucleotide level with pangolins and bat hcov genome whereas the similarity level increased up to 9782 and 9867 at amino acid level table 2
 this indicates that most substitutions taking place were of synonymous type among various protein coding genes nsp4-10 nsp12-14 nsp16 m e and orf6 shared highly conserve amino acid composition between bat-hcov and hcov with 99 similarity especially nsp7-10 nsp16 e and orf6 share 100 amino acid similarity table 2 the 100 similarity in these regions across 591 hcovs bat and pangolin-hcov mark them to be a probable target region for future antibodies and vaccine therapy notably nsp2 and nsp14 region in hcovs were most diversified in terms of nucleotide when compared to pangolin and bat-hcov whereas orf10 and e regions were the least diverse table 2 we investigated the phylogenetic analysis of 591 genomic sequences of hcov obtained from gisaid database using raxml methods the phylogram was majorly divided into 5 groups based on their clade division bat and pangolin-hcov were categorized in the group i and all other hcovs were categorized in group ii to v fig 2
 group ii comprises of the human 2019-ncov mainly belonging to different province of china however few exceptions were also from south korea japan vietnam chile usa india belgium spain germany and france hcovs group iii mainly comprised of the hcovs belonging to usa while group iv represented the hcovs of mixed type population belonging to several countries distributed over continents group v possess the hcov from european countries along with few hcovs of america and one from taiwan to understand mystery underlying the clustering pattern of the hcovs bat and pangolin-hcov were used as a reference sequence to observe the nucleotide substitution in hcov members in different groups interestingly hcov members group ii and group iii falling in proximity to group i have less substitution in the genome sequences table s2 the tc groupv-hcovbat-hcov and groupv-hcovpangolin-hcov substitution were frequent in group v as compared to hcov representing other groups table s2 the genomic signature of usa-hcovs present in group v is very different from usa-hcovs of group iii this could be indicative of differences between direct and community transmission of the virus member belonging to each subgroup has distinct genomic features in terms of nucleotide substitution table s2 genomic comparison of 591 hcov sequences among the human as well as with pangolin-hcov and bat-hcov revealed several sites possessing substitutions which clearly indicated the mutation in viral genome either according to the geographical locations or upon interaction with the human immune system the nucleotide substitution in hcov genomes were predominantly of transition type with 45 being ct fig 3
a a detailed investigation of the nucleotide substitution in the coding region of hcovs genome with perspective of encoded amino acids revealed 43 synonymous and 57 non-synonymous substitutions table s3 the proteins nsp1 nsp5 nsp7-10 nsp14-16 orf4 orf7a orf7b and orf10 mainly possessed synonymous substitutions and hence were mostly devoid of amino acid changes fig 3b the 57 amino acid changes were distributed over 12 regions in the 30 kb genome the number of amino acids substitutions varied between different regions such as 7 in nsp2 10 in nsp3 5 in nsp4 3 in nsp6 1 in nsp12 4 in nsp13 11 in spike 3 in orf3a 2 in orf5 1 in orf6 2 in orf8 and 8 in orf9 fig 4
 intriguingly various important non-synonymous mutations were observed majorly in european and us continent while the mutations were mostly synonymous in asian continent these interesting observations can be used to infer the reason behind larger infectivity and pathogenicity in these regions table s3 further two type of amino acid change viz conservative and radial replacements were intensively studied with respect to previous reports stating the effect of such changes on the enzymatic activities mutations were most prevalent in the spike region followed by nsp2 nsp3 and orf9 n table s3 spike region determines the specific binding to host receptor and initiation of viral replication this region is reported to be the most potent and indispensable for viral attachment and entry into host system the rrar amino acids found only in the human covs spike region has proved to be essential for binding to host receptor 18 we observed similar region in the hcov genomes studied 23713-23724 region in nucleotide alignment although there was mutation in two hcov-england nucleotide sequences ctccgcggcggg in place of ctcctcggcggg but the resulting amino acid remained same in all hcov genomes these findings corroborate the essentiality of rrar sequence for viral infection to host system we found different type of mutation in hcov spike protein at different places such as leucine to valine l8v glutamine to histidine q675h and also found in orf3aq57 h glutamine to lysine q239 k and aspartate to glycine d614 g and also found in orf5 d3g might have potential role to augment viral infection table s3 previous investigations showed mutations such as leucine to valine change in retroviral envelope protein glutamine to lysine in influenza virus glutamine to histidine and aspartate to glycine in h1n1 had a severe impact in virus entry replication and cross infectivity to other species 19 20 21 additionally mutations were present in structural proteins such as glycine to valine mutation in orf3a g196 v and g251 v similar amino acid change imparts resistance against inhibitor drug saquinavir in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 this might provide an explanation why drugs used for treating hiv became a failure in case of hcov infection 22 notably in orf9 region the nucleotide sequence ggg changed to aac in european and american continent resulting in a change of amino acid from rg to kr agggga coding for rg changed to aaacga coding for kr 28993-28995 in nucleotide alignment furthermore several amino acid changes were also observed in the non-structural proteins nsp of the hcovs which may affect the virulence and titer threonine to isoleucine substitution was observed in different nsp proteins nsp2t85i nsp3t127i and t1030i and nsp4t295i mainly in european and us samples earlier reports established that threonine to isoleucine substitution increased viral infectivity of ebola virus and resistance to ganciclovir in human cytomegalovirus 2324 importantly alanine to valine substitution in non-structural protein ns2a in zika virus affects viral rna synthesis and results in vivo viral attenuation 25 this mutated virus also induce a comprehensive protection against lethal challenge proposed by the wild type zika virus falling in similar lines alanine to valine substitutions in non-structural proteins nsp3 a1187 v nsp4 a457 v and nsp6 a46 v could reduce viral lethality of hcovs table s3 these mutations might pave way towards identification of less lethal strains and help to raise immunity to counteract the noxious strains an isoleucine to valine mutation nsp2 i559 v and nsp3 i797 v and methionine to isoleucine nsp4 m33i were observed in hcovs change of isoleucine to valine in polymerase subunit pb2 of influenza virus resulted in critically enhanced activity of reconstituted polymerase complex 26 and m to i substitution in hiv-1 reverse transcriptase imparted resistance to nucleoside analog 23-dideoxy-3thiacytidine 3tc 27 interestingly presence of a non-synonymous substitution in rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp region in majority of european hcov samples resulted in change of amino acid from proline to leucine p314 l it will be quite interesting to validate the effect of this substitution on rdrp activity as one of the previous study established that similar change of proline-to-leucine substitution p236 l of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase imparts resistance against a highly specific inhibitor bisheteroarylpiperazines bhaps 28 these examples clearly show that amino acid changes may significantly affect the functional competency of polymerase and the associated subunits in conclusion present study enlightens about several types of mutation such as deletion insertion and substitutions present in 2019-ncov samples these mutations may vary at different geographical distribution or interaction with different host systems few mutations also resulted in change of amino acid which may provide an explanation for failure of previously employed antiviral therapies this research will better equip the researchers to utilize the mutated amino acid information for drug targets in particular geography and less cases of failure beside the substitution resulting into transformation to a more virulent strain there are number of highly conserved regions in the hcov genome which can be used as target for inhibitory drugs and vaccine development for a large repertoire of strains finally we believe that our data provide useful information pertaining the changes in genomic and proteomic features which could serve as a guide to design the future antiviral therapies and diagnostics mt performed the computational analysis dm prepared all the figures and tables mt and dm designed the project and wrote the article the authors declare no conflict of interest  article discoveries characterization of the substitution hotspots in sars-cov-2 genome using bioaider and detection of a sr-rich region in n protein providing further evidence of its animal origin zhi-jian zhou ye 1 qiu xing-yi ge  the novel human coronavirus sars-cov-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic worldwide the increasing sequencing data have shown abundant single nucleotide variations in sars-cov-2 genome however it is difficult to quickly analyze genomic variation and screen key mutations of sars-cov-2 in this study we developed a visual program named bioaider for quick and convenient sequence annotation and mutation analysis on multiple genome-sequencing data using bioaider we conducted a comprehensive genome variation analysis on 3240 sequences of sars-cov-2 genome herein we detected 14 substitution hotspots within sars-cov-2 genome including 10 non-synonymous and 4 synonymous ones among these hotspots nsp13-y541c was predicted to be a crucial substitution which might affect the unwinding activity of nsp13 a key protein for viral replication besides we also found 3 groups of potentially linked substitution hotspots which were worth further study in particular we discovered a sr-rich region aa 184-204 on the n protein of sars-cov-2 distinct from sars-cov indicating more complex replication mechanism and unique n-m interaction of sars-cov-2 interestingly the quantity of srxx repeat fragments in the sr-rich region well reflected the evolutionary relationship among sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-2 related animal coronaviruses providing further evidence of its animal origin overall we developed an efficient tool for rapid identification of mutations identified substitution hotspots in sars-cov-2 genomes and detected a distinctive polymorphism sr-rich region in n protein this tool and the detected hotspots could facilitate the viral genomic study and may contribute for screening antiviral target sites  the severe pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by a 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which was first detected and characterized in wuhan china at the end of 2019 1 2  later the name of this virus was suggested as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv 3  sars-cov-2 is a new pathogen and showing high infectiousness fast spread partial asymptomatic infection and other new features 4 5  at present the virus has been detected in the most countries and regions around the world threatening public health normal social life and economy sars-cov-2 has infected millions of people with more than 250000 deaths worldwide as of may 8th the viral envelope n protein plays an important role in virus replication and pathogenesis 19 20  based on seven conserved replicase domains in pp1ab polyprotein-1ab for the classification of coronavirus sars-cov-2 belongs to the sarbecovirus subgenus of the genus betacoronavirus in the subfamily orthocoronavirinae together with human sars-cov and bat various sarsr-covs sars-related covs and sars-cov-2 is highly similar to bat coronavirus bat-cov-ratg13 genetically 1 21 22  similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 as receptor besides the serine protease tmprss2 plays an important role in activating spike s protein 23  some novel features of sars-cov-2 has been revealed like a furin protease cleavage site in the spike which may be related to viral transmissibility 24  recently a novel bat-derived coronavirus rmyn02 with the similar furin insertion in the s was found which emphasized the bat origin of the virus 25  as a member of rna virus the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp encoded by coronavirus lacks the proofreading capability which leading to high mis-incorporation rate during replication even with the help of exoribonuclease like exon 26  together with the genome recombination events it could cause viral diversity and promote the transmission and disease of coronavirus 27  at the same time in order to better adapt to the host the virus usually mutates continuously under the selection pressure of the host in particular some non-synonymous substitution sites with high frequency are often experience strong positive selection 28  considering the continuous increase of infected people and the high variability of the virus it is important to pay attention to the genomic changes of sars-cov-2 recently 7 substitution hotspots in sars-cov-2 orf1ab-g10818t orf1ab-l3606f orf1ab-c8517t orf3a-g752t orf3a-g251v s-a1841g d614g g171t q57h orf8-t251c orf8-l84s and n-ggg608609610aac n-rg203204kr have been reported 29 30 31 32  in addition the non-synonymous substitution of orf3a-g251v and orf8-l84s both cause the amino acid aa polarity changing which may affect the conformation of the protein and lead to function altering 31  despite these recent discoveries in order to deal with the continuous variation of sars-cov-2 and the accumulation of sequencing data methods for quick and efficient analysis of the mutations feature and substitutions hotspots of sars-cov-2 genome are urgently required however analyzing a large number of variant sequences is difficult for biological or clinical expert without bioinformatics and programming skills some tools such as mutpred can analyze variations by entering amino acid sequence but unable to handle synonymous substitutions and consecutive nucleotide mutations like dinucleotide and trinucleotide substitution 33  in this respect we have developed a visualization analysis tool bioinformatics aider v10 bioaider v10 httpsgithubcomzhijianzhou01bioaiderreleases bioaider showed high efficiency and convenient in gene annotation and mutation screening on multiple genome-sequencing data in this research we collected 3240 complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from 64 different countries and regions sampling time from december 24 2019 to april 1 2020 we conducted a detailed genome mutation analysis using bioaider we identified 14 substitution hotspots and 3 groups of possible linkage substitutions especially we found distinctive polymorphism on sr-rich region of n protein in sars-cov-2 and related coronaviruses in other animals our work provides a new tool for recognition of the variation and evolution of sars-cov-2 contributes to research the replication and pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov-2 and gives further evidence for the animal origin of sars-cov-2 for these mutation analysis results of bioaider v10 the two main results are the summary of mutation sites fig 1a  and the detailed log files fig 1b for positioning mutated strain bioaider puts complex algorithms and fault-tolerant processing mechanisms inside presenting users a very simple interface and prompts are added to interface controls which is extremely friendly for users especially we fully considered the time complexity and space complexity and optimization related algorithms which makes bioaider owns higher processing efficiency more importantly it will continue to be in development we will update the version for linux systems and add new features later as a demonstration here we used bioaider for the mutations analysis of viral genome sequences in this study substitution refers to synonymous or non-synonymous substitution and mutation includes all the genomic variance the frequency of mutation or substitution refers to the number of mutant strains compared to the reference strain sequence in this study compared with the early viral sampling strains epiisl402119 in gisaid database a total of 2152 mutation sites regardless of insertions or deletions were identified in 3239 sars-cov-2 sequenced whole genomes accounting for 736 of sars-cov-2 full-length gene  table 1  the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution sites was counted as 784 268 and 1335 457 respectively among these non-synonymous substitution sites 738 resulted in changes in amino acid properties besides 12 sites contained both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution depending on the strains and a total of 21 termination mutation sites were also detected  table 1  in all the coding genes three with the of the most mutation sites were orf1ab spike s and nucleocapsid n gene the number of mutations sites were 1400 296 and 168 respectively accounting for 658 775 and 1336 in their corresponding gene length  table 1  the gene with the highest proportion of mutation sites was orf10 containing 16 mutation sites were in 114 bases which occupied 1404 of orf10 all the mutation sites and viral starins of sars-cov-2 detected by bioaider in this study were summarized in stable 1 and stable 2 to assess the overall substitution frequency of these mutated sites we divided the substitution frequency into six different groups and drew the frequency spectra of 2119 substitution sites 784 synonymous and 1335 nonsynonymous of 3239 sequenced strains fig 2  the result shows that the substitution sites of non-synonymous were always over synonymous except for the fifth group besides a large number of sites with substitution frequencies between 1 and 5 and more than half of the substitution sites only are observed in a single strain we also found 60 sites owning a substitution frequency greater than 20 including 40 non-synonymous substitution sites and 20 synonymous substitution sites the substitution frequency distribution of synonymous or nonsynonymous sites for each codon gene are in sfigure 1 totally 2119 substitution sites were detected in 3239 sequenced strains most of them with a lower frequency we defined the site with substitution frequency over 200 as the substitution hotspot thus far 14 substitution hotspots were identified which distributed in orf1ab s orf3a orf8 and n gene fig 3  among these substitution hotspots 10 sites were non-synonymous and 4 were synonymous as for these non-synonymous substitution hotspots 6 substitution sites caused a change on polarity or chargeability of amino acid especially there was a trinucleotide substitution hotspot on the n gene and caused two amino acid changes fig 3  according to the substitution hotspots we divided two geographical regions china and outside of china and studied the distribution differences of mutant and referential type in geographical area at each substitution hotspots respectively fig 4  as the result showing except substitution hotspots of orf1ab-10818 and orf3a-752 mutant type and referential type in the 12 other substitution hotspots showed significant spatial distribution differences p001 chi-square test between china and outside of china furthermore we found in substitution hotspots of orf1ab-8517 and orf8-251c the mutant type orf1ab-8517t or orf8-251c owned a higher ratio and were more prevalent in china than outside of china opposite to other 10 substitution hotspots make further efforts we found some hotspots contains substitutions with similar patterns and frequency table 2  indicating potential connection among these substitution hotspots and then we found 3 groups of possible linkage substitution in order to facilitate research we used gene names and base position to mark them these linkage substitution hotspots were most likely orf1ab to test our hypothesis we compared the number of strains between referential type and mutant type which synchronously mutated at the possible linkage substitution hotspots table 3  for each combination of possible linkage substitution hotspots we found mutant type and referential type in accounts for more than 98 of the population it implied that the genetic variants in these combined substitution hotspots were not independent but linkage given 541 th aa was one of known key sites of nsp13 for binding to nucleic acids in sars-cov the non-synonymous substitution hotspot of orf1ab-y5865c nsp13-y541c in nsp13 probably affects the function of nsp13 we conducted protein model prediction of sars-cov-2 nsp13 by homology protein modeling the result showed that closest protein model to sars-cov-2 nsp13 was 6jyt2a with 9983 amino acid identity which came from sars-cov as the result shown the tertiary structure of nsp13 were almost completely overlapping between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov fig 5a  besides the 541 th aa was relatively conservative in sars-cov-2 related animal coronaviruses fig 5b  two non-synonymous substitution sites near the furin cleavage region of prra on s protein were identified fig 6  table 2  there were 7 mutant strains with s-g2025c s-q675h and one with s-a2024g s-q675r among 3239 sequenced strains 675 th aa on s protein was the sixth amino acid upstream of prra and we found s-q675h and s-q675r made original polar amino acids from no-charged to positively charged we found a continuous variable area with non-synonymous substitutions from 183th to 204th aa on the n protein in sars-cov-2 fig 7  and there were 5 variably sites with non-synonymous substitutions frequency over 20 including a trinucleotide substitution which led to two consecutive aa substitution of r203k and g204r table  2  notably there were 2 strains substituted on the 196 th and 201 th codons of sars-cov-2 too but they were synonymous substitutions which did not cause amino acid substitutions stable 1 the variable area was rich in ser s and arg r and contains srxx repeat fragments we compared the region among sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 related coronavirus sars-cov and sarsr-cov in this area fig 7  and found that it was relatively conserved in sars-cov-2 related coronavirus sarsr-cov and sars-cov but showed distinctive polymorphic in sars-cov-2 interestingly we found 4 srxx repeat fragments in most strains of sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 related coronavirus strains but sarsr-cov and sars-cov lacked the third srxx repeat fragments due to one amino acid substitution we found the number of srxx repeat fragments well reflects the evolutionary relationship among sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 related coronavirus sarsr-cov and sars-cov especially he substitution of two continuously amino acids on the last srxx repeat fragments 203 th and 204 th in sars-cov-2 was exclusively observed in sars-cov-2 to explore the polymorphism of sr-rich region aa 183-204 on sars-cov-2 n protein we intercepted the amino acids in this region after culling some strains sequence containing degenerate bases in the region that could not be translated normally we screened the sr-rich regions in the remaining 3233 strains the results showed the sr-rich regions in sars-cov-2 can be divided into 23 different types table 4  including the reference type the two main types were the reference type 2561 strains and the mutant type of n-r203kg204r 494 strains the majority of the 22 mutant types harbored only single-amino-acid substitution compared to the reference type indicating that this region was relatively conserved among most sars-cov-2 strains however we could still find some distinctive polymorphism among different strains the sampling date showed that most mutations existed in the 3233 recently sequenced strains implying a constant evolution of the sr-rich region in sars-cov-2 genome program tools for high-throughput analyses on big sequencing data of genome are of great importance for genomic and evolutionary studies in comparative genomic studies it is very important to identify whether amino acid properties have changed when dealing with non-synonymous substitutions which can help to identify some important mutations more importantly simplicity of operation and high summary of analysis results could save a lot of time for researchers thus we have developed the bioaider program aiming to liberate researchers from numerous sequencing data bioaider v10 contains more than 10 functional programs for sequence processing and analysis it can be applied to assisting gene batch annotation and quickly mutations analysis for coding gene for mutations analysis bioaider can distinguish and summarize all the nucleotide variations sites with corresponding mutation type and frequency and then generates the frequency distribution map of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution sites the expansion and optimization of bioaider in the future will endow the software more functions in this study we conducted high-resolution analysis of mutations within sars-cov-2 genome based on 3240 sequenced strains using bioaider 2152 mutation sites among different strains were detected which accounted for 736 of the complete genome these mutation sites included 1335 non-synonymous substitution sites implying abundant variations in the genome of sars-cov-2 however more than half of the mutation sites were only observed in a single strain of sars-cov-2 which was difficult to be distinguished from sequencing errors considering there were only 60 sites with substitution frequency above 20 therefore we speculated that there were no large-scale mutations in the sequencing strains we analyzed according to the spatial distribution analysis between strains of mutant types and referential type regarding the substitution hotspots 12 of 14 sites showed significant distribution differences in china and outside of china indicating different virus prevalence in the two regions we also noticed mostly strains sampled in china were before mar 2020 this was due to the epidemic of china has been roughly controlled in march considering these facts we speculate that virus differentiation in and outside of china may attribute to human intervention in sars-cov nsp13 the 541 th aa is critical for the protein function and double mutations of s539ay541a show higher unwinding activity for nucleic acids binding 17  the amino acid identity of nsp13 between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov was 9983 and their tertiary structure was almost completely overlapping indicating that nsp13 541 th aa is also a vital site for the function of sars-cov-2 nsp13 notably the mutant strain of nsp13-541c first appeared in the united states sampled on feb 20 2020 and the united states was the country with the largest number and extremely high proportion of this mutant strains 316 78 of all the 405 mutant strains with nsp13-y541c we also noted that there were a total of 711 strains sampled in the united states on feb 20 2020 and beyond strains with nsp13-y541c accounted for almost half of these strains in the united states this fact indicates that nsp13-y541c has gone through less negative selection pressure and even this variation may be beneficial therefore we speculate that nsp13-y541c improves the unwinding activity of nsp13 and promotes the replication of sars-cov-2 contributing to their rapid spread in the united states however further studies are required to reveal the detailed effect of substitution in 541 th aa of sars-cov-2 nsp13 and whether the possible linkage substitution site of 504 th aa plays a synergistic role in this process among the potential linkage substitution hotspots identified in this study orf1ab-8517 and orf8-251 were observed in a recent research 31 34  among the triple linkage substitution hotspots of orf1ab-277 orf1ab-14144 and s-1841 orf1ab-c2772t belongs to synonymous substitution while orf1ab-c14144t caused the aa change of nsp12-p323l in interface region which is a bridge section connecting nirna nidovirus rdrp-associated nucleo-tidyltransferase and fingers of rdrp 14  the 614 th aa in s protein was located in the subdomain sd region downstream of the receptor-binding domain rbd on s1 we found that mutant strains with nsp12-323l  s-614g were popular in the world and owned more than half the frequency 52 in the population indicating that this mutant was dominant in sars-cov-2 however the functional impact of amino acid changed in these two sites is still unclear at present and whether nsp12-323 and s-614 are related on specific function needed more experimental data to verify previous studies have reported that sr-rich region in sars-cov is crucial for n protein multimerization and the interaction with membrane m protein 35 36  in the sr-rich region of n protein there was only 2-aa difference between sars-cov-2 referential type and sars-cov therefore the similar function of sr-rich region may exist in sars-cov-2 although there is no relevant research reported at present compared to sars-cov sars-cov-2 harbors one more srxx repeat fragments in the 193 th -196 th aa of n protein previous research reported that the sr-rich region of sars-cov in 184 th -196 th aa was crucial for n protein multimerization and the deletion of this region completely would make n protein abolish the self-multimerization 36  besides srxx repeat fragments may play an important role in sars-cov infection 37  we noted that sars-cov could be regarded as a deletion of srxx in sr-rich region compared to sars-cov-2 and the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 was higher than sars-cov thus whether sr-rich region of sars-cov-2 plays an important role in this process is worth to explore however the research about sr-rich region in coronavirus was still limited at present especially unlike sars-cov the region in sars-cov-2 is still constantly evolving implying that the n protein of sars-cov-2 may employ a more flexible replication mechanism and even interaction with m protein a study reported that the n protein of sars-cov can specifically bind to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnrnps a1 and plays an important role in rna replication and transcription especially the key binding region is in the sr-rich region of sars-cov n protein aa 161-210 the interaction between human hnrnp a1 and sars-n protein may be the key to sars-cov replication and transcription 37  whether such a similar mechanism exists in sars-cov-2 is still unclear however in human cells there are more than 20 hnrnps has been discovered and sr-rich region of sars-cov-2 showing distinctive polymorphism whether the sars-cov-2 can bind to one of these hnrnps needs more verification it might provide a new hint in understanding the process of sars-cov-2 replication in human cells besides the potential phenotype changes related to nonsynonymous substitution hotspots on third srxx repeat fragments of sars-cov-2 may be also worth attention in the hotspot screening we have found several substitutions critical for viral replication potentially for instance the orf1ab-c794t was located on nsp2 and nsp2 was reported to inhibit the host protein phb1 and phb2 which benefited viral replication indicating that orf1ab-c794t may affect viral replication 11  the orf3a-g171t q57h was located at the transmembranous domain of the 3a protein sfig 2 3a protein was reported to form ion channels on host cell membrane and enhance the membrane permeability which benefited sars-cov life cycle 38  thus orf3a-g171t q57h may affect the formation of ion channels and subsequently influence the viral replication as for orf3a-g752t g251v a recent analysis predicted that it was in an important functional domain and might be related to virulence infectivity ion channel formation and virus release 30  we also found several important sites for virus entry though they showed lower substitution frequency in our research data for instance s-q675h and s-q675r near furin cleavage region possibly influence the cleavage of rrar a critical step for virus entry fig 6  we also detected a strain with the mutation of s-r408i located in the rbd stable 1 which was reported to play an important role in virus-receptor binding by a recent study 39  in summary we initially revealed the variation characteristics of sars-cov-2 and predicted the possible impact for some non-synonymous substitution hotspots the nsp13-y541c was crucial which may affect the unwinding activity of nsp13 and the replication of sars-cov-2 especially the sr-rich region of n protein in sars-cov-2 shows distinctive polymorphism and the quantity of srxx repeat fragments well reflects the evolutionary relationship among sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 related coronavirus sarsr-cov and sars-cov it providing a new clue to study the formation mechanism of sars-cov-2 in this study we could not include all the sequences of sars-cov-2 due to the rapid increase of the genomic data more researches or real time analysis with relevant clinical data may contribute to the viral epidemiology of sars-cov-2 and treatment of covid-19 bioaider v10 was developed based on python 37 and r 352 and used pyqt5 for interface packaging bioaider is a local software containing more 10 subroutines and can run on windows systems at present httpsgithubcomzhijianzhou01bioaiderreleases bioaider is mainly used to process and analysis genome sequencing data such as viral genome data the main two functions are mutation analysis and batch extract gene for auxiliary sequence annotation at present first for batch processing genes users can import the aligned complete genome sequence set fasta or fas format and adjust the reference sequence for gene extraction to the forefront of the sequence set paste the related gene information of reference sequence in the input box gene name star string and end string which separated by  sfig 3a then user can batch extract genes from a large number of sequences note that the length of start string or end string is not limited in but it is required to be unique in the reference sequence second for mutation analysis bioaider will scan all the codons in the aligned sequence using the first sequence in the data set as a reference sequence bioaider can identify five different mutation types synonymous non-synonymous insert deletion and termination based on the standard codon method it can distinguish the changes in properties of amino acid when dealing non-synonymous substitutions then it will locate the position of the corresponding base in the mutated codon so it can identify multiple types of mutation at the same site and also well discriminate dinucleotide and trinucleotide substitution next it summarizes all the mutation sites with corresponding frequency and strains and if user chooses to generate the frequency distribution of synonymous or non-synonymous sites bioaider will directly generate the results in vector format image sfig 3b of note the frequency distribution map does not include those sites that are both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution because such sites cannot determine the common substitution frequency the 3240 complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with relatively higher quality of sequencing were downloaded from gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg and the reference genome sequence of sars-cov-2 nc0455122 for orf annotation was from genbank httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenbank all the viral strains used in this study were listed in stable3 multiple sequence alignment of genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 were accomplished using mafft v7407 40 the annotation and extraction of codon genes of these 3240 sars-cov-2 genome sequences using bioaider v10 we extracted 11 continuously coding genes based on the annotation information of nc0455122 including orf1ab s orf3a e m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 n and orf10 then we used muscle program in mega v7014 to align these coding genes based on codons method 41  we combined these 11 continuously coding genes to tandem sequence in bioaider and used it to represent the complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 for subsequent analysis among all the early sampled virus strains dec 24 2019 to dec30 2019 genome of wuhanivdc-hb-012019 gisaid id epiisl402119 sampled in dec30 2019 occupied most frequently 65 strains sequence were same with ivdc-hb-012019 in 3240 sequenced strains and appears in multiple regions therefore the strain of epiisl402119 was used the reference sequence for genome variation analysis of sars-cov-2 in bioaider v10 the tertiary protein structure was downloaded from the protein data bank pdb httpwwwrcsborg and protein homology modeling was calculated by online tools swiss-model then using chimera 1102 to simulate the effect of a single amino acid mutation on protein structure 42 43  the frequency of x axis indicates the number of variant strains at the same substitution site and the number one of first group represents that only one strain was mutated at this site the y axis represents the count of substitution sites corresponding to the range of frequency the frequency spectra was drawn using bioaider by specifying five different groups the value of the substitution site indicates the position on the corresponding gene and showed the two main bases and ratio at substitution hotspots of 3239 sequenced strains in particular the substitution hotspots in n gene was a trinucleotide mutation round represented polar aa changed to non-polar aa triangle represented non-polar aa changed to polar aa diamond represented change in charge of polar aa the substitution hotspots with red fonts represent new identified in this study fig 4  spatial distribution of referential types and mutant types in 14 substitution hotspots note strains which contained degenerate bases in substitution hotspots were culled and spatial distribution differences of mutant type and referential type in hotspots was based on chi-square test  the mutant strain in sars-cov-2 was represented using earliest sampled strain of this mutant type the red and blue boxes represent the srxx-repeat domain   comparative genomic analysis revealed specific mutation pattern between human coronavirus sars-cov-2 and bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 longxian lv gaolei li jinhui chen xinle liang yudong li  the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 2019-ncov is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single-stranded rna genome with positive-polarity to reveal the evolution mechanism of sars-cov-2 genome we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced sars-cov-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different sars-cov-2 strains 58 of them caused amino acid change indicating a result of neutral evolution however the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene 907 between sars-cov-2 wiv04 and bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses range 129 -481 the elevated synonymous mutations between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection moreover their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with tc transition which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of rna 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon the codon usage was similar between sars-cov-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage b suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern in comparison of sars-cov-2 wiv04 with bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates dnds was the lowest among all performed comparisons reconfirming the evolution of sars-cov-2 under stringent selective pressure moreover some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection therefore our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts  sars-cov-2 also known as 2019-ncov is a novel coronavirus covs isolated from patients with pneumonia in china 2019 sars-cov-2 has a similar incubation period median 30 days and a relatively lower fatality rate than sars-cov or mers-cov 1 but it is estimated that the reproductive number of sars-cov-2 is higher than that of sars-cov 2  whats more some laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases are absent of apparent cough fever or radiologic manifestations making it difficult to timely and accurately find out all infected patients 3 4  as of february 28 2020 patients infected by sars-cov-2 have been diagnosed in more than 30 countries and more than 78000 confirmed cases and 2700 deaths associate with sars-cov-2 infection are reported in china alone the genetic information of a virus is essential for not only its classification and traceability but also its pathogenicity at the whole genome level the sequence identify of sars-cov-2 was 50 to mers-cov 79 to sars-cov 88 to two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 collected in 2018 in zhoushan china  and 96 to bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 collected in 2013 in yunnan china 5  each genome of all sars-cov-2 strains now submitted online contains nearly 29900 nucleotides nt which are predicted with at least 14 open reading frames orfs 5 to 3 such as orf1ab p 21291 nt spike s 3822 nt orf3a 828 nt envelope e 228 nt membrane m 669nt orf8 366 nt and nucleocapsid n1260 nt 6  among them the spike gene encoded a glycoprotein that is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity and highly divergent when compared with that of bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 931 nucleotide identity 6 7  generally the rates of nucleotide substitution of rna viruses are faster than their hosts and this rapid evolution is mainly shaped by natural selection mostly purifying selection 8  gene mutations such as nucleotide substitutions deletions and insertions have been frequently reported when comparing sars-cov-2 with other viruses 5 6 7  in this work we investigated the mutation pattern of sars-cov-2 by comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the nonsynonymous synonymous substitution relative synonymous codon usage rscu and selective pressure in order to explore their potential in evolution and function the sars-cov-2 reference genome wuhan-hu-1 nc045512 and wiv04 mn996528 was downloaded from the genbank database other newly sequenced 2019-ncov genomes were downloaded from the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg twenty-one closely related coronavirus complete genome sequences and their coding sequences cds were downloaded from genbank database supplementary   table s1  genome sequences were aligned using muscle v3831 9 followed by manual adjustment using bioedit v725 phylogenetic analyses of complete genome were performed using maximum-likelihood method and general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rates among sites gtrg in raxml v8121 10  support for the inferred relationships was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and trees were rooted with the alpha-coronavirus lineage as an outgroup the coding sequences were translated and aligned using the mega-x program 11  and then codon-based sequence alignment was used for further analysis phylogenetic analyses of coding sequences were performed using mega-x software the changes of amino acids or nucleotides for each cds sequences were analyzed using in-house perl script the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ds and the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site dn for each coding region were calculated using the nei-gojobori method jukes-cantor in paml package 12  the adaptive evolution server httpwwwdatamonkeyorg was used to identify eventual sites of positive selection for this purpose the following test has been used mixed-effects model of evolution meme which allows the distribution of dnds  to vary from site to site and from branch to branch at a site 13  this test allowed us to infer episodic and pervasive positive selection at individual sites to investigate the potential relative synonymous codon usage rscu bias of the spike protein from sars-cov-2 and its closely related coronaviruses the coding sequence cds of spike protein in these coronaviruses were calculated with codonw 144 httpcodonwsourceforgenet the rscu of human genes was retrieved from the codon usage database httpwwwkazusaorjpcodon the potential relationships among these sequences were calculated with a squared euclidean distance  u h u  besides rscu the effective number of codons enc was used as a simple metrics to verify codon bias and to explore the source of virus statistical analyses were performed using the r statistical package version 3 chi-squared test was used to compare any two data sets and data were considered significantly different if the two-tailed p value was less than 005 the mutation pattern between sars-cov-2 and its closely related coronaviruses the newly identified sars-cov-2 strain wiv04 genome sequence was closely related with bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 and bat-sl-covzc45 which was collected from host rhinolophus affinis 5  compared with ratg13 genome many nucleotide substitutions are observed but there are only five small inserts and deletions indels mutations and the largest insert segment in wiv04 genome was  cggcgggcacgt  sequence which is located near the boundary of s1 and s2 regions of spike protein interestingly only synonymous mutation are observed near this insertion sequence  fig 1  panel c compared with bat-sl-covzc45 genome this insert segment is detected as well but non-synonymous mutations are also observed around it then we further compared the proportion of synonymous mutations in spike gene between wiv04 and ratg13 or bat-sl-covzc45 the ratio of nucleotide substitutions 263 nt to amino acid substitutions 29 aa was 907 from wiv04 to ratg13 which was significantly higher than the ratio 391 864221 from wiv04 to bat-sl-covzc45 p  005 fig 2  moreover we also observed that the synonymous mutations increased in whole genome level between wiv04 and ratg13 than that between wiv04 and bat-sl-covzc45 next the detailed nucleotide changes of each comparison group were analyzed and we found that the t-to-c tc transition mutation was enriched in the nucleotide substitutions between wiv04 and ratg13 fig 1b  its reported that the covs lacking a 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon accumulated 15 to 20 fold more ag and uc transition 14  whats more the rna mutagen 5-fluorouracil 5-fu treatment will also increase the uc and ag transitions consequently this increased tc mutation implies the exon of sars-cov-2 may be deactivated compared with that of ratg13 among all current reported sars-cov-2 strains is similar to that between wiv04 and bat-sl-covzc45 391 but is dramatically less than that between wiv04 and ratg13 907 according to random drift hypothesis 15  these nucleotide mutations among different sars-cov-2 strains now available are still determined by neutral evolution in short there has no powerful factor to force sars-cov-2 to evolve in a certain direction by far however we should take strict precautions against the strong factors that may cause directional variation of sars-cov-2 both in natural environment and infection treatment to investigate whether the mutation pattern between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 is unique across all coronavirus species we further compared their alterations of nucleotides and amino acids in comparison to other representative coronaviruses phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 and its 20 closely related coronaviruses formed four well supported clades fig 2 indicate that the relative level of synonymous substitutions between human sars-cov-2 and its possible animal origin ratg13 is much higher than that between other human coronaviruses and their potential animal sources different organisms even different protein coding genes of the same species have different frequency of codon usage 16  the rscu bias will reveal the difference of the host source we calculated the distance of rscu between spike genes of 20 representative coronaviruses and and bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 was 117 which was the lowest except for snu01 another strain of sars-cov-2 indicating that their codon preference was almost the same the second lowest codon usage difference was 241 that was detected between sars-cov-2 wiv04 and bat-sl-covzc45 fig 2  2  which is similar with those of ratg13 and other bat coronavirus in beta-covs lineage b indicating the high synonymous mutation was not determined by codon usage bias to infer whether the retention of synonymous mutations is supported or hindered by natural selection we further studied non-synonymous substitution rate dn and synonymous substitution rate ds in spike gene table 1  generally positive darwinian selection increases but negative purifying selection decreases the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates dnds the results showed that both dn and ds of s gene of sars-cov-2 wiv04 versus bat-sarr-cov ratg13 were the lowest among all typical coronaviruses while those of sars-cov tor2 versus bat sars-like coronavirus wiv1 were the second lowest when the ratio of dn to ds of spike gene is compared all the tested dnds are less than 1 indicating that these non-synonymous mutations are harmful and negative selection will reduce their retention speed ratg13 was 004 which was the lowest among all comparisons reconfirming that the rate of synonymous mutation was increased between wiv04 and ratg13 strains moreover dnds rate of polyprotein orf1ab and nucleocapsid n genes were similar with that of spike gene table   s2  the spike s protein undergoes several drastic changes during virus infection for instance its large parts are cleaved during infection by cellular proteases and expose the receptors to activate viral attachment to the host 17  as the receptor binding domain rbd of spike protein was involved in interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein the rbd region was thought to be preferential targets of natural selection 18  consistent with this hypothesis our results showed that both dn and ds of rbd region are increased in comparison with whole spike gene region across all the virus pairs used in this study table 1  notably the dnds ratio of rbd region in sars-cov-2 wiv04 was dramatically increased in about 3 fold in comparison with full spike region consequently these mutations may be subjected to darwins choice and will become evidence of adaptive protein evolution to detect positive selection on the spike gene the meme analysis was performed significant p  005 pervasive episodic selection was detected in three sites 48th 254th 330th position using the reference sequence of wiv04 on the 254th position of the spike amino acid sequence there is a histidine residue instead of a phenylalanine residue whereas on the 330th amino acidic position in wiv04 sequence there is a glutamine residue instead of an valine residue the results described above strongly supporting the action of positive selection in spike gene during the recent evolution of sars-cov-2 and ratg13 however this result should be addressed with careful explain because the rbd region of spike gene from sars-cov-2 was quit divergent with that of ratg13 fig s1  suggesting it might have originated from homologous recombination between ratg13 and one yet-unknown coronavirus 19  through comprehensive comparative analysis between sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses we found the synonymous mutations is dramatically elevated between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 than that of other coronavirus strains and the nucleotide mutations were enriched in tc transition the specific mutation pattern may caused by the loss function of rna 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon moreover as the sars-cov-2 was supposed to be originated from bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 the increased synonymous substitution between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 strain suggested the sars-cov-2 genome was under stronger negative purifying selection we also detected some sites in spike protein was experiencing positive selection these observations suggest that adaptive evolution might contribute to its host shifts however as the rna mutagen eg 5-fu could induce the same mutation pattern the mechanism of the mutation pattern observed between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 should be further investigated in future work the whole genome sequence identity between these paired strains was larger than 95 01088 00542 04983 00785 00406 05167 the whole genome sequence identity between these paired strains was larger than 95   reverse genetics of the largest rna viruses paul masters s   three times the size of alphavirus genomes or four times the size of picornavirus genomes the chances are proportionately increased that any individual full-length cdna will harbor one or more cryptic lethal mutations these might be generated by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase itself by the reverse transcriptase rt used for first-strand cdna synthesis or by the dna polymerase used for second-strand cdna synthesis or pcr polymerase chain reaction amplification identification of such mutations might also be difficult because published cdna sequences generally have been obtained from clones subject to the same sources of error an additional problem on the path to a full-length coronavirus clone arises from the experience of some investigators that certain large genomic subclones are unstable when propagated in escherichia coli this raises the prospect that a fulllength clone will be similarly afflicted as has been observed for clones of yellow fever virus rice et al 1989  and hepatitis c virus forns et al 1997  although these and other potential obstacles should not be insurmountable they have until now diminished the enthusiasm of individual research groups to invest much effort in the construction of a full-length coronavirus clone nevertheless the continued development of improved techniques particularly long rt-pcr thiel et al 19971 makes it likely that such a goal will eventually be achieved noteworthy in this regard important milestones have been reached with the infectious full-length clones of the arteriviruses equine arteritis virus van dinten et al 1997 and lelystad virus meulenberg et al 1998  which are 127 and 152 kb respectively because coronaviruses currently remain a class apart from all other positive-sense rna viruses an alternative method has had to be devised for their genetic manipulation this method targeted recombination is less direct and more laborious and so far it has been applied exclusively to site-directed mutagenesis of mouse hepatitis virus mhv  consequently all discussion in this review will be limited to this viral prototype mhv causes a number of different diseases in mice depending on viral strain as well as host genetic makeup and immune status compton et al 1993  it thus provides very useful models for studies of viral pathogenesis because it also grows well in tissue culture which can be problematic for other members of the coronavirus family the molecular biology of mhv has been studied intensively mhv virions contain four essential structural proteins fig l  which assemble and bud into the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus the most prominent of these the spike glycoprotein s forms oligomers that protrude coronavirus genomic organization mrna expression and virion structure the arrangement of genes in the prototype mhv strain a59 is represented at the top beneath this is the set of positive-and negative-sense rna species synthesized in infected cells the protein products obtained from each positive-sense rna are indicated two products polyproteins nsla and nslab are translated from genomic rna by means of a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism all other proteins are translated from the first open reading frame of each functionally monocistronic subgenomic rna the inset shows a schematic of a virion containing the minimal set of essential structural proteins from the virion membrane envelope and attach to species-and tissuespecific host cell receptors the most abundant virion protein the membrane glycoprotein mi spans the envelope three times and has a large carboxy-terminal tail that resides in the interior of the virion a very small membrane protein e present in small amounts is the third constituent of the envelope finally within the envelope the nucleocap-sid protein n wraps the rna genome into a helically symmetric filament which as suggested by some work may be further organized into an icosahedral shell risco et al 1996  two additional structural proteins appear in many strains of mhv but their absence from some strains or mutants indicates that they are nonessential the first of these is a hemagglutinin esterase he which has apparently evolved from an ancestor shared with the hemagglutinin of influenza c virus luytjes et al 1988  the other is the largely hydrophobic protein product i of the internal open reading frame of the n gene fischer et al 1997a  this relative paucity of structural proteins accounts for less than one-third of the coding capacity of the mhv genome fig 1  the bulk of the genome encodes a huge nonstructural polyprotein nsla and nslab the proteolytic products of which include the rna-dependent rna polymerase proteinases a helicase and numerous polypeptides of unknown function these proteins constitute the machinery of viral rna replication and transcription and it is thought that most of them form a large complex associated with an intracellular membranous compartment brown and brierley 1995  coronavirus rna synthesis at first glance appears to be a strange amalgamation of synthetic schemes employed by disparate families of rna viruses for reviews see van der most and spaan 1995  following its translation into the products of gene 1 the genomic rna becomes the template for synthesis of at least a fulllength negative-sense antigenome fig 1  further events produce a series of smaller rnas of both polarities the positive-sense subgenomic rnas each of which serves as the message for one of the downstream encoded proteins have compositions equivalent to those of large genomic deletions each contains a 70-nt leader rna identical to the 5 end of the genome joined at a downstream intergenic region to the 3 end of the genome the negative-sense subgenomic rnas roughly one-tenth as abundant each have the complement of this arrangement including a 5 oligou tract and a 3 antileader sethna et al 1991  it should be noted that of all these rna species only the full-length positive-strand genome is ultimately packaged into virions the mechanism by which the subgenomic rnas are produced is still an open question about the only point of consensus is that contrary to what one might have initially assumed from their structure the subgenomic rnas are not produced by splicing of a fulllength precursor another generally agreed-on notion is that simple base-pairing interactions alone cannot account for the mechanism of leader-to-body fusion for the subgenomic rnas fusion is probably the result of quasi-continuous synthesis across two distant portions of a looped-out template that are brought together via protein-protein interactions  two major unresolved issues remain however the first is whether the leader-to-body fusion event occurs during positive-strand or negative-strand rna synthesis the second is whether the subgenomic negative-strand rna species are active templates for the amplification of positive-strand subgenomic rnas or conversely whether they represent dead-end products an additional distinctive feature of coronavirus rna synthesis crucial to the subject of this review is the high rate of homologous rna-rna recombination that occurs during the course of infection lai 1996  this is thought to result from a template-switching mechanism similar to that shown to operate for poliovirus kirkegaard and baltimore 1986  on a fine scale mhv recombination seems to be random banner and lai 19911  although selective pressures can create local biases banner et al 1990  over the whole genome the rate of mhv recombination has been estimated to be 1 per 13 kb baric et al 1990  given that coinfecting coronavirus genomes can exchange genetic information it seemed likely that this property could be exploited to introduce specific mutations into mhv toward this end koetzner et al 1992 initially reported the engineering of a 5-nt insertion into the 3 untranslated region 3 utr of mhv via targeted recombination with an in vitro synthesized rna this experiment was facilitated by the finding of an n gene mutant designated alb4 that was both temperature sensitive and thermolabile owing to the deletion of a 29amino-acid linker between two domains of the n protein although this mutation is not completely lethal at the nonpermissive temperature 39c alb4 forms tiny plaques at this temperature that are easily distinguishable from wild-type plaques moreover incubation of alb4 virions at 40c for 24 hours results in a 100-fold greater loss of titer than for wild-type virions koetzner et at 1992  these phenotypic traits allowed the selection of recombinant viruses following cotransfection into mouse cells of alb4 genomic rna together with a synthetic copy of the smallest subgenomic rna rna7 tagged with a marker in the 3 utr  fig 2  progeny of the cotransfection were subjected to heat treatment and recombinants were chosen as large-plaque survi- vors at 39c analysis of the purified genomes of these viruses by rt-pcr and by direct rna sequencing showed that recombination had restored the material that had been deleted in alb4 and that the unselected 5-nt insertion was present in the 3 utr these results were thus consistent with the generation of recombinants by a single crossover event between the recipient genomic rna and the donor synthetic rna occurring at any point within the n gene upstream of the alb4 deletion  fig 2  shortly thereafter van der most et al 1992 reported the isolation of site-specific mutants of mhv obtained with the use of derivatives of a cloned defective interfering di rna as the donor species coronavirus di rnas are extensively deleted versions of the genomic rna that have retained signals sufficient for their own replication when provided with the necessary enzymatic activities by coinfecting helper virus brian and spaan 1997  the di rna employed in this study midi-c contains a fusion of three segments of the mhv genome 38 kb of the 5 end of the genome which includes part of gene la a 08-kb fragment of gene lb and 08 kb of the 3 end of the genome which includes the distal third of the n gene fig 3  a derivative of midi-c was used to restore the material that is deleted in alb4 simultaneously marking it with a coding-silent point mutation and recombinants were selected by a method similar to that described above there was a notable and important distinction from the other work however whereas koetzner et al 1992 had estimated a fre- quency of recombination on the order of with subgenomic rna7 as the donor the use of the di donor rna yielded recombinants at a rate some three orders of magnitude higher this higher efficiency made it feasible to screen for recombinants in the absence of selection in this manner van der most et al 1992 demonstrated the transfer of coding-silent mutations in gene l a of midi-c to wild-type mhv at a frequency of about 1 to date these remain the only engineered mutations in gene 1 of a coronavirus subsequently masters et al 1994 directly compared the rates of targeted recombination with rna7 versus di donor rnas and noted frequencies with the latter comparable to those that had been observed with midi-c rna for this purpose a vector template for synthesis of a pseudo-di rna pb36 fig 31  was constructed in imitation of a naturally occurring di rna of bovine coronavirus bcv chang et al 1994  the frequency of recombination obtained with pb36 rna was sufficiently high to allow simplification of the protocol for constructing mhv mutants from the alb4 recipient virus an infection-transfection procedure replaced cotransfections which had required purification of substantial quantities of alb4 genomic rna and in many cases large plaque-forming recombinants could be detected directly among progeny without a heat treatment to counterselect the alb4 parent in more recent work ever-larger pseudo-di rna vectors have been constructed to extend the reach of the technique to encompass all of the structural protein genes of mhv fig 3  although pb36 rna was shown to be an authentically replicating di rna masters et al 1994  it has never been determined if the larger constructs are replicationcompetent because they serve well as donor rnas moreover one particular variant smaller construct pbl34 rna hsue and masters 19971  was found to not replicate despite being an efficient donor rna it was originally thought that the ability of the donor rna to replicate was the crucial feature that led to an enhanced efficiency of recombination masters et al 1994  but this may not be the case another observation possibly related is that many targeted recombinants were isolated that were found to have been generated by multiple crossovers hsue and masters 1997 peng et al 1995b de haan et al 1998 kuo and p s masters unpublished results 1998  these recombinants appear to occur more frequently than would be expected if each crossover were an independent event that is if the probability of a single crossover is p  then double crossovers should occur as p 2 and triple crossovers as p 3  this suggests that the alignment of two templates is the rate-limiting event in recombination and once this has been achieved the barrier to multiple crossovers may be only marginally higher than that for single crossovers di rnas possibly possess elements absent from subgenomic rnas that mediate the colocalization and alignment of rna synthesis templates the choice of the other component for targeted recombination the recipient virus generally has depended on the fortuitousness of classical genetics generally one must first find a mutant in order to construct a mutant for the purposes of selection any conditional lethal mutant with a sufficiently low reversion rate ought to work well as a recipient virus in practice the n gene deletion mutant alb4 has been used almost exclusively in a few instances another n mutant albl also has proved a suitable recipient fischer et al 1997a peng et al 1995b  albl is a point mutant that like alb4 is both temperature sensitive and thermolabile masters et al 1994  in contrast an s gene mutant alb18 ricard et al 1995  thus far has not been a useful recipient perhaps because there is significant selective pressure favoring accumulation of revertants even at the supposedly permissive temperature for this virus as noted above there is no absolute requirement that the recipient virus be capable of being selected against in one of the original demonstrations of the method van der most et al 1992 used wild-type mhv as the recipient and screened individual plaques to identify recombinants bearing markers in gene 1 to date the n gene has been the gene most thoroughly explored by targeted recombination probably because it falls in the region of the genome that was the earliest accessible to the method the first mutants in which specified coding changes were incorporated into mhv were for second-site point mutations that were found t o revert the phenotype of alb4 to obtain an understanding of the nature of these mutations in isolation targeted recombination was used to introduce two of them back into the n gene in the absence of the alb4 deletion peng et al 1995a  the resulting recombinants were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type showing that the reverting mutations in isolation were not grossly deleterious to the virus unlike the deletion mutation for which they could compensate however the n proteins of these mutants were found to bind more tightly t o rna than wild-type n protein did and a more detailed analysis of one of them showed that it was at a competitive disadvantage with respect to the wild type more extensive mutagenesis to probe important features of the n protein structure was carried out through construction of mhv mutants con-taining chimeric n genes in which portions of the bcv n gene were substituted for their corresponding mhv sequences peng et al 1995b  this work identified segments of the two n proteins that despite an evolutionary divergence of 30 remained functionally equivalent notably this included most of the rna binding domain of the protein equally important it was possible to tentatively map noninterchangeable regions of the protein that participate in species-specific protein-rna and protein-protein interactions thus providing foci for future genetic study this work demonstrated that targeted recombination could be used to create extensive substitutions in the coronavirus genome generating recombinants that could not be made otherwise between two viruses separated by a species barrier a surprising finding was that some of the bcv-mhv chimeric n protein mutants exhibited altered pathogenicity compared to wild-type mhv these mutant viruses following intracerebral inoculation were unable to exit the brain and reach the bloodstream and this property was found to map to a region of 80 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal third of the n protein  further work is underway to localize this pathogenic determinant more precisely to a subset of the 17 residue differences between bcv and mhv in this region another n gene mutant was made to assess the significance of the internal open reading frame i gene that is embedded entirely within the first half of the n gene in the 1 reading frame fischer et al 1997a  the i gene encodes a largely hydrophobic protein that is expressed via a leaky-scanning translational strategy senanayake and brian 1997  to disrupt this gene its start codon was replaced and a stop codon was introduced shortly thereafter both of these changes were chosen to create only coding-silent mutations in the n reading frame these mutations were demonstrated to abolish i protein expression while not detectably affecting n protein expression in the same experiments it was discovered that the i protein is a previously unrecognized structural protein of mhv the resulting imutant was found to be viable at all temperatures tested and formed plaques only slightly smaller than those of its wild-type counterpart the mutant also showed no gross differences with respect to the wild type in its ability to infect mice an important consequence of the nonlethality of disruption of the i gene is that this eliminated a potential source of ambiguity in the analysis of any n gene mutants isolated or constructed in the region where n and i overlap upstream of the n gene targeted recombination has just begun to be used to gain insight into the workings of the proteins of the viral envelope one of the most exciting developments in the study of corona-viruses was the surprising discovery by vennema et al 1996 and bos et al 1996 that intracellular expression of just the e and m proteins resulted in the formation and extracellular release of virus-like particles vlps that were morphologically identical to the envelopes of whole virions thus coronavirus assembly can take place through interactions largely independent of the participation of the nucleocapsid or the spike glycoprotein what role the e protein may be playing in this process is particularly intriguing because this component is very small and is present in minute amounts in virions or vlps to approach this question genetically mutations were created in the e gene fischer et al 1998 by clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis a method that has a high reported rate of success in producing temperature-sensitive and other conditional-lethal phenotypes wertman et al 1992  of the four possible mutants to be made by this algorithm one was apparently lethal and one had a wild-type phenotype the other two mutants were partially temperature sensitive and were much more thermolabile than the wild type when grown at the permissive temperature the more defective of the two mutants when examined by negative-stained electron microscopy exhibited morphological aberrations rarely seen in wild-type virions including narrow elongated shapes pinched at many points these results provided striking corroboration for the pivotal role of e protein in coronavirus assembly established by the vlp expression studies an additional noteworthy aspect of this work was that the two temperature-sensitive e mutants were obtained by pcr-based screening of pools of candidate recombinants rather than by selection in a similar fashion some forays have been made into the m gene to probe its role in assembling the virus as with the e gene targeted mutagenesis of the m gene has been done mostly in the wake of meticulous studies in the vlp system which identified the carboxyl terminus of the m molecule as crucial to assembly de haan et al 1998  in the expression system deletion of as little as the final carboxy-terminal residue of m protein almost completely abolished formation of vlps and many amino acid substitutions at this position had a similar effect in contrast the incorporation of each of the same mutations into the whole virion had little or no effect on the viral phenotype deletion of two carboxy-terminal residues however was lethal to both vlps and virions these experiments supported a critical role for this region of the m protein in mhv assembly and indicated that additional intermolecular interactions in virions lead to an increased structural stabilization not present in vlps this work has also underscored the value of establishing a dialogue between the vlp expression system and the targeted recombination system it is anticipated that future interplay of the two methodologies will result in evidence of the functional roles in assembly of the components of the virion envelope and lead to a map of protein-protein interactions the remaining essential structural protein the spike glycoprotein s is the object of intense scrutiny by many researchers seeking to understand its central roles in receptor binding and initiation of infection through fusion with the host cell membrane most aspects of coronavirus pathogenesis are thought to stem from the variable selectivity of these processes or from the host immune response provoked by the s protein compton et al 1993 holmes and dveksler 1994  both the size of the s gene and its relative distance from the 3 end of the genome figs 1 and 3 forestalled its earlier accessibility to targeted recombination but this boundary has now been crossed in the course of constructing mutations in the nonstructural and nonessential gene 4 a recombinant was isolated that had inherited a coding-silent marker near the 5 end of the s gene from a pfv1-derived donor rna fig 3  fischer et al 1997b  separately zhang et al 1997 reported the detection and analysis by rt-pcr of a number of different chimeric viruses in which portions of the s gene of the enterotropic mhv strain ri were recombined into the s gene of the respiratory mhv strain a59 significantly the donor vector contained the mhv-ri s gene inserted ectopically into a midi-c-related di rna so that recombinant viruses had to be formed by two crossover events this approach holds promise if a method of isolating these recombinants can be devised the first isolated mhv recombinants harboring engineered coding mutations in the s gene have now been obtained by weiss and coworkers one of these containing a point mutation less than 05 kb from the 5 end of the s gene q159l was constructed to assess the effects of this single amino acid change segregated from any other changes on the pathogenic properties of the virus comparison of the q159l mutant to its isogenic wild-type counterpart confirmed that this mutation plays an important role in the loss of hepatotropism by the virus leparc-goffart et al 1998  a second mutant was constructed with a single alteration h716d at the proteolytic cleavage site near the center of the s protein in order to examine the role played by cleavage of s protein in cell-to-cell fusion and in uiuo virulence as predicted the h716d mutation was found to prevent s protein cleavage and interfered with syncytia formation by infected cells in tissue culture but the mutant replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in the brains and livers of infected mice both of these mutants were generated with pfv1-derived donor rnas and with alb4 as the recipient virus remarkably linkages of 10-20 were observed between the selected n gene marker and the unselected s gene mutations this bodes well for future genetic manipulation of this centrally important virion protein many questions about coronavirus rna synthesis have been successfully approached by the use of di rnas indeed di rna systems are the best models for the dissection of cis-acting elements whose alteration would be lethal in the context of the whole genome van der most and spaan 1995 lai et al 1994 brian and spaan 1997  there is also an entire class of questions that will require the development of a robust in vitro viral rna synthesis system capable of initiating both transcription and replication whole-genome mutagenesis would not be expected to be useful in addressing these issues either there are however areas where viral genetics can complement di rna studies or reveal properties of viral rna synthesis that are lost from di rnas because of their extensive deletions an example of the latter was found serendipitously when the gene for green fluorescent protein gfp was inserted into mhv in place of the 5 two-thirds of gene 4 fischer et al 1997b  this incidentally resulted in the creation of the largest known rna viral genome as anticipated this recombinant virus produced a larger version of subgenomic rna4 originating from the intergenic sequence upstream of the inserted gfp gene quite surprisingly however a set of 10 additional rna species were also produced all originating from a cluster of sites in the middle of the gfp gene centered about the point where in distance from the 3 end the intergenic sequence had been prior to the insertion fig 4  this suggested that long-range rna interactions can contribute to the determination of the sites of leader-to-body fusion even in the complete absence of a canonical intergenic sequence a second discovery facilitated by targeted recombination was the finding of a conserved rna secondary structure in the 3 utr of mhv that is essential for viral replication hsue and masters 1997  the existence of this bulged stem-loop immediately following the n gene stop codon fig 5 became apparent from analysis of allowed and unallowed substitutions of segments of the bcv 3 utr in place of the corresponding sequences in mhv and it was confirmed through a combination of viral genetic constructs and di rna replication experiments genetic and structural methods are currently being used to further investigate the role of this structure in viral rna synthesis  in the foregoing examples an attempt has been made to indicate the usefulness of targeted recombination as a means of carrying out reverse genetics on coronaviruses but at least three current drawbacks or limitations of the method must be pointed out the most obvious of these is the requirement to design mutations that are informative but are not lethal indeed if a recombinant is to be obtained by selection then it cannot be less fit than the recipient virus that is being selected against this means that one must choose ones battles wisely although it can be unequivocally established that a mutation is not lethal or significantly deleterious to the virus the converse is not true as the technique is presently constituted it cannot be determined without ambiguity whether failure to construct a given mutant is due to the lethality of the mutation in question or to other unknown factors in the experiment a fairly convincing argument can be made that a particular mutation is lethal if one consistently obtains recombinants that inherit markers both upstream and downstream of the mutation of interest but exclude that mutation via multiple crossover events de haan et al 1998  l kuo and p s masters unpublished results 1998  nevertheless an infectious full-length clone would afford a more straightforward means of determining whether a mutation was absolutely lethal a second limitation of targeted recombination is the current restriction of the method to the 3 end of the genome as noted above only a bulged stem-loop structure in the 3 utr of mhv essential for viral replication nucleotide numbering begins at the first non-polya base at the 3 end of the genome the stop codon for the n gene is boxed two silent mutations have been created thus far in gene 1 van der most et al 1992  although strategies analogous to those used for the structural protein genes can be imagined they will probably be most applicable only to the 5 proximal region of the genome a comprehensive genetic study of the highly complex gene for the rna polymerase and all of its associated activities will likely await either the construction of an infectious full-length clone or the development of an innovative scheme for mutant selection a third limitation of targeted recombination it is to be hoped is a temporary one so far the application of this technique has been con-fined to mhv however there are numerous cousins of mhv particularly bcv transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev infectious bronchitis virus ibv and feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv that cause economically important diseases of livestock poultry and domestic animals the development of targeted recombination for these viruses may aid the design of vaccines or other means of intervention in addition many fundamental advances in understanding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses have come from the study of these viruses and a broadening of the genetic tools available for any one of them will undoubtedly benefit the entire field toward this end di rnas have been identified cloned and characterized for bcv chang et al 1994  tgev mendez et al 1996  and ibv penzes et al 1994  it has also been demonstrated that rna recombination is not a unique property of mhv kottier et at 1995  it therefore seems likely that practical selection or screening strategies will be devised for site-directed mutagenesis and chimera construction for other coronaviruses despite the limitations noted the targeted rna recombination system has given us access to a subset of the possibilities for genetic manipulation that will be allowed by the development of an infectious full-length clone of a coronavirus even when the latter goal is realized targeted recombination may still be the method of choice for the construction of many genomic mutations the sheer size of a full-length clone and its scarcity of unique restriction sites will likely necessitate that particular site-directed mutations be introduced via two stages of subcloning thus at least for structural gene mutations that are not expected to be severely deleterious targeted recombination may remain the less complicated alternative for creation of mhv mutants one area that may be explored further is the development of mhv as an expression vector the failure of earlier attempts to insert a new transcription unit into the 3 utr of the virus can now be understood as having disrupted the essential bulged stem-loop structure in this region hsue and masters 1997  more judicious placement of an extra intergenic sequence in the 3 utr has been found to result in the synthesis of a new subgenomic transcript however there is still a barrier not yet understood to the length of the sequence that can be inserted downstream of the intergenic motif hsue and masters 1999  an alternative site of foreign gene insertion would be that which has already been tried in gene 4 fischer et al 1997b  it may be possible to overcome the aberrant transcription observed here previously by altering the gene 4 intergenic sequence to resemble that of one of the more abundantly transcribed genes of mhv it is conceivable though that we may then encounter other cryptic rna sequences or structures that inherently limit the usefulness of coronaviruses as expression vectors a novel approach to this problem has been pioneered by liao et al 19951 who engineered an mhv di rna to serve as an expression vector this was used to express he protein in cells infected with a strain of mhv that does not express its own he protein thereby producing pseudorecombinant virions that efficiently incorporated the expressed protein dissection of the di he gene led to the mapping of regions of the ectodomain of he protein critical for its incorporation into virus particles an area of considerable promise for the future application of targeted recombination is the investigation of the pathogenesis of coronaviruses many previous studies in this field have of necessity relied on comparisons between viral strains with numerous major differences not all of which are well characterized targeted recombination in many cases will allow construction of isogenic viruses differing at as little as a single codon in addition the mutations sought are generally not severely impaired in tissue culture and should thus be amenable to isolation by selection rather than by more cumbersome screening procedures the two recently constructed s gene mutants discussed above illustrate these points well  the substrate specificity of sars coronavirus 3c-like proteinase keqiang fan liang ma xiaofeng han huanhuan liang ping wei ying liu luhua lai

 the coronavirus 3c-like proteinase recognizes a highly conserved core sequence position p2 to p1 of leu-gln-serala 3 4 5 7 13 14 in this study residues at position p2 p1 and p1 were mutated to amino acids with similar or different properties the activities of mutated substrates have indicated that the conserved core sequence reveals high hydrolytic activity mutation at these positions will decrease the substrate activity significantly or completely abolish its activity such as p2r p1l and p1 mutants see table 1 p1 position mutants with small residues ser ala and gly which are commonly found in this position in 3c-like proteinase cleavage sites have comparable substrate activity when it is replaced by a large leu no substrate peptide is cleaved as observed by rp-hplc this confirms that small aliphatic residues are favored at p1 position the single mutation of gln-p1 to glu or asn abolishes the substrate activity completely which is compatible with the absolute specificity for the gln-p1 substrate residue this result strongly suggests that the gln-p1 is critical for substrate binding and cleavage p2 position requires a large hydrophobic residue as shown in the native cleavage sites when leu-p2 is replaced by arg a positive-charged large residue no cleavage is observed in hplc-based assay these results confirm the hydrophobic interaction between the p2 residue and the s2 pocket of the enzyme indicated by crystal structure 3 5 mutations to small residues such as ala also decrease the relative reaction activity of the substrate significantly although phe val and met are tolerant at p2 for sars 3c-like proteinase 10 the mutation of leu-p2 to other hydrophobic residues decreases the substrate reaction activity by a factor of 5200 see table 1 the relative reaction activity of mutated substrates was significantly decreased while the p2 residue is replaced by -branched ile and val this result indicates that the steric hindrance effect is important in the residual specificity at p2 position our previous research has shown that the -strand-like conformation of the substrate is favored for substrate binding and cleavage 10 in this study we have further studied the residue specificity and its relationship with the residue secondary structure tendency via substrate mutation residues at position p5p3 are mutated to ala leu val and thr which differ in their polarities and secondary structure tendencies the relative activities of the mutants are listed in table 1 it is interesting that all the four mutants at position p5 have significant increment in their activities by a factor of 333390 this indicates that ser is not the best residue for position p5 position p5 shows no specificity among residues that have different secondary structure tendency but the decrement of residue polarity seems helpful for the substrate activity when ala-p4 is replaced by residues with higher -sheet tendency such as val and thr the substrate activity increases obviously on the other hand similar mutation at position p3 only causes little increment in substrate activity it is notable that the native substrate s12 has an -helix-preferred residue ala at position p4 and a -sheet-preferred residue val at p3 single mutation of ala-p4 to val or thr will increase the -sheet tendency of the substrate significantly due to the tandem -sheet-preferred residues at position p4 and val at p3 however single mutation of val-p3 to other residues does not increase the -sheet-preference of the substrate due to no such cooperation being found with the -helix-preferred ala-p4 the possibility of conformational cooperativity with its neighbors is in agreement with the activity increment which explains the different activities of mutants at position p4 and p3 this is supported by the multiply mutated substrates s21s23 which are designed for increasing the -sheet-preference of the substrate by tandem-placed -sheet-preferred residues and have highest activities among the tested substrates in table 1 it is notable that the mutation of val-p3 to lys substrate p3k causes 268-fold increment in its hydrolysis activity as shown in the crystal structure the side chain of glu-166 of the enzyme is exposed to solvent and is near the edge of the specific pocket s3 it is possible that the formation of the salt bridge between the side chain of lys-p3 and that of glu-166 of the enzyme is helpful for substrate binding this result suggests that an additional positive charge at position p3 will be propitious in the substrate or inhibitor design the contribution of each residue to the substrate activity is further investigated using truncated substrate based on the native substrate peptide s12 the activities of the native octapeptide and 6 truncated substrates are determined by hplc peptide cleavage assay and are listed in table 2
 as shown in table 2 the activity of the substrate decreases after truncation longer substrates which have more residues binding to the proteinase specific pockets are favored in enzyme binding and hydrolysis however the contributions of residues at different positions are significantly different deletion of ala-p4 and val-p3 causes significant decrease in the activity of the substrate by a factor of 114 and 708 respectively while the activity of substrate s17 deleting ser-p5 remains 763 compared with that of native octapeptide s12 this result suggests that the residues at position p4 and p3 are important for substrate recognition and binding on the other hand the residues at c-terminal of the substrate seem to be less important as shown in table 2 deletion of phe-p3 and gly-p2 decreases the substrate activity by a factor of 503 and 115 respectively phe-p3 has large contribution to substrate hydrolysis which may arise from the potential hydrophobic interaction between the aromatic side chain and the enzyme the quantitated lg k

peptide substrates it also confirms all previous discoveries derived from the substrate activities directly especially the relationship between the hydrolysis activity and the substrate secondary structure preference previous researches on the coronaviruses 3c-like proteinases via sequence analysis have suggested a highly conserved core sequence position p2 to p1 of leu-gln-serala 3 4 5 7 13 14 all the 11 cleavage sites in sars coronavirus have a conserved gln at position p1 8 of them have a leu at p2 and 9 have ala or ser at p1 similar result has been reported in the sequence analysis of 77 cleavage sites of 3c-like proteinases in different coronaviruses 13 in this study mutation at these positions decreased the substrate activity significantly or completely abolished its activity this indicates that the conserved core sequence reveals high hydrolytic activity both the highly conserved substrate sequence and the specific enzyme might be the result of a cooperated evolutional process the crystal structures of tgev and sars coronavirus 3c-like proteinases in complex with a hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone inhibitor 3 4 afford the structural insights into the substrate specificity of coronavirus 3c-like proteinase as shown in the crystal structure the hydrogen bond formed between the side-chain amide group of gln-p1 and the imidazole of a conserved his in the enzyme is critical for substrate recognition and binding 3 4 mutation of gln-p1 to glu or asn is tolerant in 3c-like proteinase in other viruses although the substrate activity may be decreased 17 18 however our result and the highly conserved gln-p1 in native cleavage sites indicate that the residue specificity at position p1 is more critical for coronavirus 3c-like proteinases p2 position requires a large hydrophobic residue especially leu as shown in the native cleavage sites although phe val and met are tolerant at p2 for sars 3c-like proteinase 10 the mutation of leu-p2 to other hydrophobic residues decreases the substrate reaction activity dramatically see table 1 it is notable that the relative reaction activity of mutated substrates decreases from 0208 0046 to about 0006 while the p2 residue is replaced by no-branched met -phenyl-containing phe or -branched ile and val this result indicates that the steric hindrance effect may be critical at this position the crystal structure of tgev 3c-like proteinase indicates that the substrate binds in the shallow substrate-binding site at the surface of the enzyme between the domain i and ii in the chymotrypsin fold an anti-parallel sheet is formed by the substrate peptide p5p3 the strand eii 164167 and loop 189191 of the enzyme and two hydrogen bonds are formed between the backbone amides of ala-p4 val-p3 and the backbone carbonyls of glu-165 ser-189 of the proteinase 3 our results about the truncated substrates suggest the two hydrogen bonds are critical for substrate binding on the other hand the c-terminal residues seem to be less important as n-terminal residues this is consistent with previous study on human rhinovirus 3c protease by cordingley et al 19 phe-p3 has large contribution to substrate hydrolysis which may arise from the potential hydrophobic interaction between the aromatic side chain and the enzyme and was confirmed in the virtual screen of sars 3c-like proteinase inhibitors 20 the crystal structure also indicates that increased -sheet tendency of the substrate will be helpful for substrate binding which has been revealed by our previous work 10 the native substrate s12 has an -helix-preferred ala at position p4 and a -sheet-preferred val at position p3 the possibility of conformational cooperation with its neighbors will explain the different activities of mutants at position p4 and p3 single mutation of ala-p4 to val or thr will increase the -sheet tendency of the substrate significantly due to the tandem -sheet-preferred residues at position p4 and val at p3 however single mutation of val-p3 to other residues does not increase the -sheet-preference of the substrate due to no such cooperation being found with the -helix-preferred ala-p4 these results suggest that the hydrolysis activity may increase further by an additional -sheet-preferred residue at position p5 substrates s21s23 are designed with continued -sheet-preferred residues at position p5p3 although no secondary structure analysis is done for these substrates due to their low solubility their high tendency to aggregation in aqueous solution implies their high -sheet content this offers further evidence for the relationship between the secondary structure tendency and the activity of the substrate of coronavirus 3c-like proteinase a comfa model was generated using the relative activities of 22 octapeptide substrates the predicting ability was tested with the multiply mutated substrate s24 which has the highest activity among all the tested substrates the lg k
catk
m of s24 predicted by our comfa model is close to the experiment this result strongly suggests that the comfa model is useful for predicting the activity of newly designed peptide substrates for sars 3c-like proteinase in summary we have designed and synthesized 34 peptide substrates for sars 3c-like proteinase and determined their hydrolysis activities by hplc-based peptide cleavage assay a comfa model was generated and its prediction ability is proved by a newly designed peptide substrate s24 the core sequence of the proteinase cleavage site is highly conserved and optimized for enzyme recognition and catalysis residues at position p4 p3 and p3 are critical for substrate recognition and binding and increment of -sheet conformation tendency at position p4 and p3 is helpful for substrate binding and hydrolysis in addition a salt bridge between position p3 and glu-166 of the enzyme will increase the activity of the substrate these results offer helpful information for understanding the mechanism of substrate recognition and catalysis of coronavirus 3c-like proteinase and the rational drug design against coronavirus  the establishment of reference sequence for sarscov2 and variation analysis changtai wang zhongping liu zixiang chen xin huang mengyuan xu tengfei he zhenhua zhang   cases of pneumonia with unknown cause emerged in wuhan china in december 2019

 so far scientists from different countries have obtained and uploaded more than 100 fulllength or partial genomic sequences for sarscov2 some companies have developed rapid nucleic acid detection kits based on these sequences however significant differences in the sensitivity and specificity among these kits have been found from clinical application of these kits in addition a standardized quantitative detection method is still lacking missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are currently not uncommon due to these reasons

 to provide template sequence for proper design of polymerase chain reaction pcr primers and probes to minimize false negative results and to obtain reliable sequence information for molecular and immunological studies on and vaccine development for sarscov2 virus we retrieved from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi and gisaid websites fulllength sequences from different regions of the world established the reference sequence for sarscov2 by homology and phylogenetic tree analyses analyzed mutations at different locations and conducted preliminary bioinformatics analyses for the reference sequence the ncbi httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenbank and gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg databases up to 14 feb 2020 were searched by using keywords novel coronavirus complete wuhan or 2019ncov the inclusion criteria included the length of the fulllength sequence which was 25000 to 32000 bp and was verified to be human sarscov2 sequence repetitively submitted sequences and sequences with too many undetermined nucleotides were excluded from this study sequences were classified as stage 1 and 2 based on the time sequences retrieved sequences obtained on feb 6 2020 went into stage 1 while sequences retrieved from feb 6 to 14 were classified as stage 2 figure 1 and table s1 homology analysis and sequence alignment were conducted for all stage 1 sequences by using primer 70 and mega 7014 the reference sequence was conducted by selecting the most common nucleotide in each position the reliability of the reference sequence was confirmed by comparing it with stage 2 sequences the clustalw program of the mega software 7014 was used to conduct multiple sequence alignment and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by using a maximum likelihood approach based on stage 1 sequences related coronaviral sequences were used as references 229eky369908 nl63mk334046 oc43mg197709 hku1kt779555 mersrcovkj813439 sarsrcovay278488 bat coronavirusmn996532 primer 70 was used to compare the reference nucleotide sequence to those of related human isolates and analyze the variation at different locations sequence comparison and variation analysis were also conducted at the amino acid level sequences of pcr primersprobes from published articles were aligned with our reference sequence to analyze sequence variation whether these primerprobe sequences overlapped with variation sites was also examined a total of 145 sequences were obtained from databases these sequences were examined and 50 sequences were excluded from the study according to predetermined criteria as a result 95 sequences among which 63 were obtained from stage 1 and 32 from stage 2 were used for analyses figure 1 these sequences were reported from china america australia thailand the united kingdom germany france finland korea japan and singapore etc table s1 the reference sequence was constructed by nucleotide sequence alignment accession number epiisl412026 the reference sequence composed of 29 870 nucleotides and 9744 amino acids the length and start and end locations of individual encoding regions are shown in table 1 the phylogenetic tree was constructed using sequences from database search stage 1 and other coronaviruses while different types of coronaviruses showed scattered distribution all sarscov2 strains clustered together tightly importantly the reference sequence was located in the middle of the sarscov2 cluster demonstrating good representativeness of the reference sequence constructed figure s1 comparison of the reference sequence with those of respective isolates showed that the overall homology among fulllength genomic sequences was 9999 9991100 and 15 1579 clinical isolates were identical to the reference strain with respect to individual encoding regions the homology in openreading frame orf 1a was 9999 9988100 the homology among the majority of other regions was 100 no variation was found in e 6 and 7b regions at the amino acid level the homology among fulllength sequences was 9999 9979100 with homology among most isolates in each region being 100 table 1 sequence alignment found that mutations at both nucleotide and amino acid levels were relatively rare however mutations did exist mutations which occurred in 3 strains were found in these locations 1a nt2662878211083 1b nt1737318060 s nt2170724034 3a nt26144 m nt26729 8

in addition six deletion mutations were found in five isolated strains these mutations resulted in four different truncations in amino acid sequence 1368 aa furthermore two deletion mutations were found in the 5 and 3 nonencoding regions respectively table s3 sequence alignment revealed differences between some primerprobe sequences and the reference sequence table 3 in a newly published article
7
 there are site differences between the primers from orf1b and the reference sequence in another publication
16
 the primer pair and probe sequences were derived from the n region and also have site differences from the reference sequence apparently these published primer pairsprobes are not likely to work well with the majority of viral isolates sarscov2 virus belongs to coronavirus an enveloped virus with a diameter of 60 to 140 nm sarscov2 is round or ovalshaped with some polymorphism
3
 the genomic characteristics of sarscov2 virus are significantly different from those of merscov or sarscov this study showed that its homology with the bat coronavirus isolate ratg13 strain mn996532 was 96 but has no more than 80 homology with other isolates of bat sarslike coronavirus table s4 which is similar to the results from other studies
18
 recent studies have shown that the homology with a coronavirus strain isolated from pangolin was 99 suggesting that sarscov2 might have originated from bat and pangolin might have served as the intermediate host between bat and human
19
 
20
 however further research is needed to confirm these assumptions the study on genomic variation of sarscov2 is very important for investigation of pathogenesis disease course prevention and treatment of sarscov2 infection establishment of the reference sequence for this virus is a fundamental work which will facilitate viral detection functional analysis vaccine design epidemic investigation evaluation of drug efficacy among others based on more than 3000 hepatitis b virus hbv sequences reported from different countries our team has divided hbv isolates into 31 different hbv subtypes established by selecting nucleotide with the highest frequency in each position using infectious plasmids constructed based on a2 b2 c2 and d1 subtypespecific reference sequences in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed complete biological functions of these reference sequences
21
 
22

 using the same approaches in this study the reference sequence for sarscov2 was constructed based on genomic sequence of 63 isolated strains the genome size of the reference strain was 29870 bp the reference sequence was identical to the genomic sequence of 15 strains 1579 isolated from clinical samples suggesting the reference strain would display full biological functions and pathogenicity since the sequences retrieved later feb 714 showed high homology with the reference sequence 999 there was no need to adjust the reference sequence as a typical rna virus the evolution rate of coronavirus could be 104 substitute per bp per year and mutation could occur during each replication cycle
12
 however phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment showed that the homology among different isolates was extremely high compared to the reference sequence the homology of the vast majority of isolates was above 9999 at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels in fact the homology in most encoding regions was 100 the lowest homology was found in strain epiisl406592 from shenzhen china 9991 nt and strain epiisl408485 from beijing china 9979 aa overall results from our analyses suggest that the virus in this epidemic might originate from the same animal species and caused widespread infection in a short period of time

23

 although sequence variation among sarscov2 isolates was low and sequence analysis showed a rather random distribution of mutations we did find mutation hot spots in this study nucleic acid detection is currently the gold standard method for diagnosis of covid19 however the sensitivity of this method is not high in clinical application
24
 sampling could be one of the reasons accounting for the low sensitivity the reagents used for detection could be another critical reason in this study sequence from 95 strains were examined and 12 locations where mutations occurred in 3 strains were found importantly among these locations mutations were found at nt8782 of orf 1a nt28144 of orf 8 and nt29095 of n region in 28 29 and 11 strains respectively therefore data from this study showed that while designing pcr primers and probes sequences in these locations should be avoided and attention must be paid to locations listed in table s2 and s3 to avoid false negative results furthermore some published primerprobe sequences were compared to the reference sequence established and differences were found this might partially explain why false negative results in nucleic acid detection of sarscov2 for diagnosis of covid19 is currently not uncommon sequence variation information obtained and sarscov2 reference sequence established in this study can provide reliable guidance for the design of primersprobes with maximal sensitivity for detection of sarscov2 nucleic acid sarscov2 encodes four important viral proteins including s e m and n proteins
2
 this study shows that sarscov2 is relatively conserved especially in the e 6 7b regions where no mutation was found hotspot mutations in orfs 1a s 8 and the n region will cause changes in the amino acid sequences of these proteins and the effects of these mutations on viral replication transmission and the induced immune responses need to be further investigated the significance of these variations is unclear and may be directed mutations adapted to the environment a potential shortcoming of this study is that since all sequences used in this study were retrieved from databases the accuracy of sequences could not be verified although the sequence included in this study is still small it basically includes most of sarscov2 complete viral sequences that have been published worldwide and is widely distributed which should be able to represent the characteristics of the virus in summary in this study sarscov2 genomic sequences that are available from the ncbi and gisaid databases so far were analyzed and the reference sequence for this virus was established the variations in individual coding regions at both the nucleotide and amino acid level were further analyzed and part of the reasons why the sensitivity of current nucleic acid detection methods is far from ideal was revealed establishment of the reference sequence for sarscov2 could benefit not only

society here we analyzed genetic variation of cov-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination after correction for mutational bias analysis of 137 sars-cov-2 genomes as of 2232020 26 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous 27 sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus in contrast to adaptive evolution 28 previously reported for sars-cov in its brief epidemic in 2003 our analysis of sars-cov-29 2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection the sequence similarity of the spike 30 receptor binding domain between sars-cov-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably 31 due to an ancient intergenomic introgression therefore sars-cov-2 might have cryptically 32 circulated within

lockdown of wuhan 251v emerged on 37 1212020 and rapidly increased its frequency thus the roles of these mutations on 38 infectivity need to be elucidated genetic diversity of sars-cov-2 collected from china was 39 two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world in addition in network analysis 40 haplotypes collected from wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections 41 both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated 42 from china 43 summary 44 in contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for sars-cov in its brief 45 epidemic our analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection the 46 sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between sars-cov-2 and a 47 sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression therefore 48 sars-cov-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being 49 recently noticed data

increased its frequency thus 54 the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated 55 56  a newly emerging coronavirus was detected in patients during an outbreak of 58 respiratory illnesses starting in mid-december of 2019 in wuhan the capital of hubei 59 province china 1  2 3  due to the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the 60 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and genome organization similarity the causal 61 virus was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 4  62 as of 3162020 167515 cases of sars-cov-2 infection have been confirmed in 114 63 countries causing 6606 fatalities as a result who declared the first pandemic caused by a 64 coronavirus on 3112020 httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-65 2019situation-reports as the virus continues to spread numerous strains have been isolated 66 and sequenced on 3182020 more than 500 complete or nearly complete genomes have 67 been sequenced and made publicly available several issues concerning the origin time of virus introduction to humans 79 evolutionary patterns and the underlying driving force of the sars-cov-2 outbreak remain 80 to be clarified 12 13  here we analyzed genetic variation of sars-cov-2 and its related 81 coronaviruses we discuss how mutational bias influences genetic diversity of the virus and 82 attempt to infer forces that shape sars-cov-2 evolution molecular evolution of sars-cov-2 and related coronaviruses 85 the resulting phylogeny reveals that ratg13 is the closest relative of sars-cov-2 86 followed by pangolin2019 and pangolin2017 then covzc45 and covzxc21 and other 87 sars-related sequences as outgroups s1 fig according to general time reversible model 88 transition occurred more frequent than transversion with c-t and a-g changes account for 89 45 and 28 respectively of all six types of nucleotide changes we next estimated the 90 strength of selection for each coding region using the dn and ds while purifying selection 91 tends to remove amino acid-altering mutations thus reducing dn and dnds positive 92 selection has the opposite effect increasing dn and dnds 14  between sars-cov-2 and 93 ratg13 orf8 gene exhibits the highest dn 0032 followed by spike 0013 and orf7 94 0011 all above the genome average of 0007 table 1  ds varies greatly among cdss 95 with the highest of 0313 in spike and the lowest of 0018 in envelope genome average 96 0168 finally dnds is the highest in orf8 0105 followed by orf7 0061 and orf3 0060 97 with the genome average of 0042 since spike shows both high ds and dn its protein 98 evolution rate dnds is only 0040 thus while the coronavirus evolved very rapidly it has 99 actually been under tremendous selective constraint 13  spike protein similarity between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 led to the idea that 101 the receptor binding domain rbd within the sars-cov-2 spike protein originated from 102 pangolin2019 via recombination 15 16 17 18  if that were the case we would expect the 103 divergence at synonymous sites ds to also be reduced in the rbd region however while 104 dn in the rbd region is 0023 approximately one third of the estimate for the rest of the 105 spike gene 0068 ds in the rbd 0710 is actually slightly higher than in the rest of the 106 spike sequence 0651 this argues against the recombination scenario we noticed that the 107 ds of the whole spike and the rbd are 2-and 3-fold respectively higher than the genome 108 average since synonymous sites are typically less influenced by selection the increased 109 divergence in ds may reflect an underlying elevated mutation rate skewed while the former shows excess of both high and low frequency mutations the latter 116 mainly exhibits an excess of low frequency changes fig 1a  the excess of low frequency 117 mutations is consistent with the recent origin of sars-cov-2 19 both population 118 reduction and positive selection can increase high frequency mutations 20 21  however 119 the first scenario is contradicted by the recent origin of the virus if positive selection has 120 been operating we would expect an excess of high frequency non-synonymous as well as 121 synonymous changes furthermore the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes is 122 246 13856 among singleton variants but only 142 1712 among non-singletons both of 123 these observations suggest that the majority of amino acid-altering mutations are selected 124 against with no positive selection in evidence the skew of synonymous variants toward high frequency deserves further discussion 126 as it relates to the underlying force driving the sars-cov-2 outbreak the puzzle is 127 probably rooted in how high and low frequency mutations are inferred the results shown in 128 the fig 1a are based on an outgroup comparison the divergence at synonymous sites 129 between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 is 17 approximately 3-fold greater than between 130 humans and rhesus macaques 22  with such high level of divergence the possibility of 131 multiple substitutions cannot be ignored especially since substitution in the coronavirus 132 genome is strongly biased toward transitions see above indeed among all non-singleton 133 mutations listed in table 2  62 of the changes are c-t transitions to get around the potential problem caused by multiple substitutions we cross- table 2  all three sequences from singapore share the t nucleotide also found in 139 the ratg13 outgroup using the outgroup comparison the c found in the rest of the human 140 sars-cov-2 sequences is a derived mutation however the t at this position is restricted to 141 genomes collected from singapore on 24 and 262020 and not found in earlier samples it is 142 thus more sensible to infer that this t is a back mutation derived from c rather than an novel mutations might be occurred within this patient cannot be 100 ruled out the 155 alternative explanation that this patient may have been co-infected by two viral strains seems 156 more plausible after cross-referencing with the haplotype network and the phylogeny all mutations 158 listed as high frequency in table 2 and fig 1a were re-assigned to the other side of the 159 frequency spectra we only see an excess of singleton mutations consistent with a recent in addition to l84s a g-t transversion at 26114 which caused an amino acid change 180 in orf3 protein g251v is also at intermediate frequency table 2  251v was first seen on 181 1222020 and gradually increased its frequency to 13 by our sampling date fig 3  we 182 note that the emergence of 84s in orf8 and 251v in orf3 are consistent with the lockdown of 183 wuhan on 1232020 the former first appeared in early january gradually increased its 184 frequency and reached a plateau around 1232020 the latter showed up on 1222020 and 185 rapidly increased its frequency within two weeks table 1  such inflation would have a large effect on dnds estimates 193 we therefore excluded singletons from dn and ds estimation the dnds of orf8 gene in episode i and ii and orf3 gene in episode ii show strong 195 signatures of positive selection consistent with increase of 84s and 251v frequency during 196 these periods and may suggest a role of adaptation table 3  the overall dnds within each 197 episode was 5-10 times higher than dnds between coronavirus genomes derived from 198 different species table 1  the elevated dnds of sars-cov-2 is either due to its 199 adaptation to human hosts or relaxation of selection for a recently emerged virus it is 200 reasonable to expect operation of positive selection at the early stage in that case the dnds 201 during episode i should be greater than during episode ii 23 24  however dnds was smaller in episode i than in episode ii across the majority of the 203 genome suggesting that elevation of dnds is probably mostly due to the relaxation of 204 selection we further divided episode i into ia and ib according to the appearance of 84s in 205 orf8 protein on 162020 the genome-wide dnds values were 027 and 023 for episode 1a 206 and 1b respectively s1 table  therefore as shown in the frequency spectra the signature 207 of positive selection is weak at the early stage of the epidemic influenced by the genome sampling scheme since the earliest available genome was sampled 216 on 12242019 almost one month after the outbreak the real origin of the current outbreak 217 may actually be earlier than our estimation 218 we estimated genetic variation including the number of segregating sites wattersons estimator of  and nucleotide diversity  of the sars-cov-2 since both  220 and  are estimators of 4nu n and u are the effective population size and mutation rate 221 respectively they should be close to each other at the mutation-drift equilibrium 25  the haplotype network also supports this notion fig 2  usually ancestral 231 haplotypes have a greater probability of being in the interior have more mutational 232 connections and are geographically more widely distributed the h1 haplotype is at the 233 center of the network and is found in four countries and many places in china in addition a 234 large portion of haplotypes is directly connected to h1 therefore it is likely that h1 is the 235 ancestral haplotype as 45 of h1 are found in wuhan this location is the most plausible 236 origin of the ongoing pandemic hosts the idea that they share five out of six critical amino acids within rbd through 252 convergent evolution seems far-fetched 253 we therefore hypothesize that instead of convergent evolution the similarity of rbd 254 between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 was caused by an ancient inter-genomic therefore these two mutations may have some functional consequences and be worth 309 investigating further by the time we prepared this manuscript the 215v frequency ceased to 310 increase however a parallel mutation has occurred in a different genomic background 311 further supporting the idea that this mutation may require further study the authors thank those who contributed to sequence generation and sharing the 348 detail is listed in s2 table  we also thank

mega-x  rampant cu hypermutation in the genomes of sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses causes and consequences for their short- and long-term evolutionary trajectories p simmonds martin schwemmle   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged late in 2019 in the hubei province china as a cause of respiratory disease occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death covid-19 14 since the first reports in december 2019 infections with sars-cov-2 were reported from a rapidly increasing number of countries worldwide and led to its declaration as a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 to understand the origins and transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 sequencing of sars-cov-2 directly from samples of infected individuals worldwide has been performed on an unprecedented scale these efforts have generated many thousands of high-quality consensus sequences spanning the length of the genome and have defined a series of geographically defined clusters that recapitulate the early routes of international spread however as commented elsewhere 5 there is remarkably little virus diversity at this early stage of the pandemic and analyses of its evolutionary dynamics remain at an early stage the relative infrequency of substitutions is the consequence of a much lower error rate on genome copying by the viral rna polymerase of the larger nidovirales including coronaviruses this is achieved through the development of a proofreading capability through mismatch detection and excision by a viral encoded exonuclease nsp14-exon 68 consequently coronaviruses show a low substitution rate over time typically in the range of 15  104 to 10  104 substitutions per site per year ssy 914 applying a midrange estimate to the 3- to 5-month timescale of the sars-cov-2 pandemic indicates that epidemiologically unrelated strains might show around 6 to 10 nucleotide differences from each other over the 30000-base length of their genomes in the present study we have analyzed the nature of the sequence diversity generated within the sars-cov-2 virus populations revealed by current and ongoing virus sequencing studies we obtained evidence for a preponderance of driven mutational events within the short evolutionary period following the zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 into humans sequence substitutions were characterized by a preponderance of cytidine-to-uridine cu transitions the possibility that the initial diversity within a viral population was largely host induced would have major implications for evolutionary reconstruction of sars-cov-2 variants in the current pandemic as well as in our understanding both of host antiviral pathways against coronaviruses and of the longer-term shaping effects on their genome composition four separate data sets of full-length near- complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 collected from the start of the pandemic to those most recently deposited on 24 april 2020 were aligned and analyzed accession numbers listed in table s1a in the supplemental material each data set showed minimal levels of sequence divergence with mean pairwise distances ranging from 55 to 95 nucleotide differences between each sequence however several aspects of the frequencies and sequence contexts of the observed changes were unexpected first the ratio of nonsynonymous amino acid changing to synonymous substitutions dnds was high in the range of 057 to 073 among the different sars-cov-2 data sets this contrasts with a much lower ratio consistently below 022 in sequence data sets assembled for the other human coronaviruses table 1 including a range of coronaviruses in the analysis there was a consistent association between dnds ratios and the degree of sequence divergence fig 1 we next estimated the frequencies of individual transitions and transversions occurring during the short-term evolution of sars-cov-2 sequence differences between each sars-cov-2 full-genome sequence and a majority rule consensus sequence generated for each of the four sars-cov-2 data sets were calculated the directionality of sequence change underlying the observed substitutions was inferred by restricting the analysis to polymorphic sites with a minimal number of variable bases typically singletons in practice because of the scarcity of substitutions variability thresholds of 10 5 2 and 1 yielded similar numbers and relative frequencies of each transition and transversion equivalent evidence for directionality was obtained through comparison of each sequence in the data set with the first outbreak sequence mn908947 wuhan-hu-1 approximately ancestral to the currently circulating sars-cov-2 strains data not shown for the purposes of the analysis presented here a consensus-based 5 threshold was used a listing of the sequence changes revealed a striking approximately 4-fold excess of sites where cu substitutions occurred in sars-cov-2 sequences compared to the other three transitions fig 2a this excess was the more remarkable given there was an almost 2-fold greater number of u bases in the sars-cov-2 genome than cs 321 compared to 184 respectively to formally analyze the excess of cu transitions we calculated an index of asymmetry frequency fcufuc  fufc and compared this with degrees of sequence divergence and dnds ratios in sars-cov-2 and other coronavirus data sets fig 2b and c this comparison showed that the excess of cu substitutions was most marked among very recently diverged sequences associated with the sars-cov-2 and sars-cov outbreaks and was reduced significantly in sequence data sets of the more divergent human coronaviruses nl63 oc43 229e and oc43 as sequences accumulated substitutions a parallel analysis of the full-genome sequences of ebola virus ebov was performed to determine whether the compositional abnormalities observed in sars-cov-2 arose as artifacts of the next-generation sequencing ngs methods used to generate the data or indeed occurred in a different rna virus with distinct entry replication and packaging strategies available sequences of ebov on genbank were divided into three groups corresponding to those associated with the most recent outbreak in the congo in sierra leone and elsewhere in west africa in the 2014 outbreak and finally a collection of older strains see table s1b these showed mean levels of within-group sequence divergence of 01 11 and 05 respectively spanning the range of divergences in the analyzed sars-cov-2 and other coronavirus data sets in marked contrast to that of sars-cov-2 sequences consistently showed dnds ratios of 01 fig 1 and no mutational asymmetry of cuuc fig 2b irrespective of their sequence divergence cu substitutions were scattered throughout the sars-cov-2 genome fig 3 long bars representing more polymorphic sites were frequently shared between replicate data sets but unique substitutions occurring once in the data set short bars showed largely separate distributions substitutions were not focused toward any particular gene or intergenic region although all three data sets showed marginally higher frequencies of substitutions in the n gene a selection of sequences showing cu changes in different genome regions was plotted in a phylogenetic tree containing sequences from the sars-cov-2 data set fig 4 with the resolution possible in the tree generated from such a minimally divergent data set many sequences with shared cu changes were not monophyletic eg those with substitutions at positions 5784 10319 21575 28657 and 28887 this lack of grouping is consistent with multiple de novo occurrences of the same mutation in different sars-cov-2 lineages the abnormally high dnds ratios of 06 to 07 in sars-cov-2 sequences table 1 fig 1 indicated that around 50 of nucleotide substitutions would produce amino acid changes if approximately 75 of nucleotide changes are nonsynonymous on analysis of amino acid sequence changes a remarkable 52 of nonsynonymous transitions in the sars-cov-2 sequence data set were the consequence of cu transitions fig 5 compared to 26 10 and 7 for ga uc and ac transitions respectively these ratios are comparable to those at all sites fig 1 apart from the greater proportion of nonsynonymous ga changes some variability might be expected given the potential fitness effects of specific amino acid changes and their likelihood of fixation notwithstanding this the underlying mechanism that leads to cu hypermutation therefore also drives much of the amino acid sequence diversity observed in sars-cov-2 the context of cytidines within a sequence strongly influenced the likelihood of it mutating to a u fig 6 the greatest numbers of mutations were observed if the upstream 5 base was an a or u there was also a similar approximately 4-fold increase in transitions if these bases were located on the downstream 3 side the effects of the 5 and 3 contexts were additive c residues surrounded by an a or u at both 5 and 3 sides were 10-fold more likely to mutate than those flanked by c or g residues mean of 319 transitions compared to 36 splitting the data down into the 16 combinations of 5 and 3 contexts a 5 u far more potently restricted non-cu substitutions than a 5 a see fig s1 while 5 g or 5 c almost eliminated substitutions irrespective of the 3 context no context created any substantial asymmetry in ga compared to ag transitions the gc content of coronaviruses varied substantially between species with highest frequencies in the recently emerged zoonotic coronaviruses middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 41 sars-cov 41 and sars-cov-2 38 and lowest in hku1 32 collectively there was a significant relationship between c depletion and u enrichment with gc content fig 7 the difference in gc content was indeed almost entirely attributable to changes in the frequencies of c and u bases the 9 difference in gc content between mers-cov and hku1 arose primarily from the 20 to 13 reduction in frequencies of c there was a comparable 8 increase in the frequency of u their combined effects left frequencies of g and a relatively unchanged it has been proposed that the asymmetry in c and u frequencies may originate in part through the selective loss of cpg dinucleotides in the genome 15 to investigate this the degree of suppression in sars-cov-2 other sarbecoviruses and other coronaviruses was compared with representative sequences of each currently classified mammalian rna virus species excluding double-stranded rna dsrna viruses mammalian rna viruses fig 8 gray circles demonstrate the previously described relationship between gc content and cpg suppression 16 the data points for the separately labeled sars-cov-2 other sars-like viruses in bats sarbecoviruses red and the remainder of the coronaviruses blue and arteriviruses green overlap these values fig 8 overall sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses actually show less suppression of cpg for a given gc content than is typical for other rna viruses sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses are therefore not compositionally unusual by these metrics providing no evidence that cpg suppression per se is associated with their mutational and compositional abnormalities the most striking finding that emerged from the analysis of more than 1000 sars-cov-2 genomes was the preponderance of cu transitions compared to other substitutions in the initial 4 to 5 months of its evolution these accounted for 38 to 42 of all changes in the four sars-cov-2 data sets in seeking alternative nonbiological explanations for this observation they cannot have arisen through misincorporation errors in the nex-generation sequence methods used to produce the data set because the analysis in the present study was restricted to consensus sequences these are generally assembled from libraries that typically possess reasonable coverage and read depth error frequencies of 104 per site 17 would therefore improbably create a consensus change in a sequence library there was furthermore no comparable increase in ga mutations fig 2 and the sequence context in which sequencing errors occur a 5 or 3 c or g 17 did not match the favored context for mutation observed in our data set fig 6 finally the parallel analysis of a similarly large collection of consensus sequences of ebov demonstrated very low dnds values and no excess of cu mutations over uc fig 1 and 2 as ebov and sars-cov-2 data were generated by comparable ngs methods it is therefore extremely unlikely that the mutational and compositional abnormalities of sars-cov-2 described in the study were the results of methodological artifacts this asymmetric mutation furthermore cannot have arisen through a mutational effect of the coronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerase during virus replication by definition a coronavirus rna genome descends from any other through an equal number of copies of the positive and negative strandsany tendency to misincorporate a u instead of a c would be reflected in a parallel number of ga mutations where this error occurred on the minus strand or vice versa as demonstrated however ga mutations occurred at a much lower frequency than cu mutations and similarly to ag fig 2a and 6 the most cogent explanation for cu hypermutation is the action of rna editing processes within the infected cell a well-characterized antiviral pathway involves the interferon-inducible isoform of adenosine deaminase acting on rna type 1 adar1 18 this edits a to inosine in regions of viral double-stranded rna which is subsequently copied as a g irrespective of its widely demonstrated antiviral role in a range of typically minus-stranded rna viruses the mutations it creates do not match those observed in sars-cov-2 or other coronaviruses first adar1 targets dsrna and so editing effects tend to be symmetric with ag substitutions being matched by uc mutations second the direction of mutation is wrong the focus of the analysis in the present study was on infrequent or unique polymorphisms where ancestral and mutant bases can be inferred the excess of cu transitions is the opposite of those induced by adar1 a second interferon-inducible pathway edits retroviral dna during transcription and is strand specific its typical antiviral activity is to mutate single-stranded proviral dna formed after first-strand synthesis from genomic rna 1921 the deamination of cs to ts leads to the observed excess of ga changes in the complementary positive-stranded rna virus genome 22 this editing function is performed by members of the apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like apobec family many of which possess defined antiviral functions against retroviruses hepatitis b viruses small dna viruses and intracellular mobile retroelements reviewed in reference 23 the apobec3 gene family members that are primarily involved in antiviral defense show evidence of extensive positive selection and expansion over the course of mammalian evolution particularly in the primate lineage humans possess 7 active antiviral proteins a3a a3b a3c a3d a3f a3g and a3h that contrast with the single a1 gene in rodents and a range of other mammals 2426 other mammals possess a diverse range of largely independently duplicated apobec3 genes with four paralogs in cats three in cows and sheep six in horses and often more than 10 in different bat species however their comparative activities and editing capabilities for different dna and rna substrates remain functionally largely unexplored while deamination of cytidines in single-stranded dna sequences is a hallmark of apobec function apobecs show binding affinities for single-stranded rna templates that may mediate antiviral functions a3b and a3f have been shown to block retrotransposition of a line-1 transposon mrna through a nondeamination pathway 27 potentially through binding to single-stranded rna direct editing of hiv-1 rna by the rat a1 apobec and the accumulation of cu hypermutation verified that rna could also be used as a substrate for deamination 28 this suggested to the authors at that time that apobec-mediated rna editing was a potential antiviral activity mechanism against rna viruses as well as retroviruses since then evidence supporting this conjecture has been difficult to obtain the virus inhibitory effect of apobecs against enterovirus a71 measles mumps and respiratory syncytial viruses were not shown to be associated with the development of virus mutations 29 30 similarly a3c a3f or a3h but not a3a a3d and a3g were shown to inhibit the replication of the human coronavirus hcov-nl63 but their expression did not lead to de novo cu or ga mutations on virus passaging 31 on the other hand it has been demonstrated that a3a and a3g possess potent rna editing capability on mrna expressed in hypoxic macrophages 32 natural killer cells 33 and transfected a3g-overexpressing hek 293t cells 34 these latter findings verify that apobecs possess rna editing capabilities but do not provide any mechanistic context for the potential inhibition of rna virus replication by this mechanism nevertheless the pronounced asymmetry in cu transitions in sars-cov-2 and the preferential substitution of cs flanked by u and a bases on both 5 and 3 sides fig 6 that broadly matches what is known about the favored contexts of a3a a3f and a3h 35 provides strong circumstantial grounds for suspecting a role of one or more apobec proteins in coronavirus mutagenesis the findings of cu mutations at the consensus genome sequence level have also been observed within virus populations in a recent analysis of intrahost sequence diversity in lung-derived covid-19 samples 36 mutations showed the 5 and 3 au contexts as observed in the present study and were proposed by the authors as representing editing sites for apobec1 intrahost diversity in this study was however dominated by minor populations generated from ga and uc substitutions their symmetry and lack of 5 or 3 context led the authors to propose the editing effects of adar in viral dsrna these and other mutations such as au and ua transversions mediated through an as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism hint at the complexity of host effects on virus sequence change the combination of exceptionally long genomes 30000 bases an otherwise low mutation rate and the unprecedented size of the present data set of accurate minimally divergent sars-cov-2 sequences assembled postpandemic has enabled these mutational signatures to be so clearly observed rna editing may indeed represent a powerful antiviral mechanism with potentially lethal effects of even single mutations introduced into the genomic sequence these make apobec-mediated anticoronaviral activity plausible in virological terms the key findings in the study were the combined evidence for an apobec-like editing process driving initial sequences changes in sars-cov-2 and that the observed substitutions have not arisen through a typical pattern on random mutation and fixation that is assumed in evolutionary models a specific problem for evolutionary reconstructions would be the existence of highly uneven substitution rates at different sites apobec-mediated editing and indeed the pattern of cu transition in sars-cov-2 sequences is strongly dependent on sequence context and for at least two apobecs additionally influenced by their proximity to rna secondary structure elements in the target sequence 32 35 sequence changes in sars-cov-2 and other coronavirus genomes may therefore be partially or largely restricted to a number of mutational hot spots that may promote convergent changes between otherwise genetically unlinked strains as demonstrated in fig 4 these can conflict with relationships reconstructed from phylogenetically informative sites furthermore the substitution rate reconstructed for sars-cov-2 and potentially other coronaviruses may represent an uncomfortable amalgam of both the accumulation of neutral changes and forced changes induced by apobec-like editing processes that may obscure temporal reconstructions a recent analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes illustrates these problems 5 only a tiny fraction of variable sites 034 were found to phylogenetically informative while a high frequency of unresolved quartets demonstrates further the lack of phylogenetic signal in sars-cov-2 evolution reconstructions the occurrence of multiple driven changes under host-induced selection is consistent with these cautionary observations the other important consequence of cu hypermutation is that most of the amino acid sequence diversity observed in sars-cov-2 strains originates directly from forced mutations and therefore cannot be regarded in any way as adaptive for the virus fig 5 an rna editing mechanism of the type discussed above evidently places a huge mutational load on sars-cov-2 that may underpin the abnormally high dnds ratios recorded in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov sequence data sets fig 1 it is likely that many or most amino acid changes are mildly deleterious and transient repeated rounds of mutation at favored editing sites followed by reversion may therefore contribute to the large numbers of scattered substitutions in sars-cov-2 sequences that conflict with their phylogeny finally it is intriguing to speculate on the long-term effects of the cuuc asymmetry and the extent to which this may contribute to the previously described compositional abnormalities of coronaviruses 15 37 as described above in connection with mutation frequencies the compositional asymmetries cannot directly arise through viral rdrp mutational biases because any resulting base frequency differences would be symmetric ie g  c and a  u instead it appears that the observed imbalances in frequencies of complementary bases reflect the progressive depletion of c residues and accumulation of us by the apobec-like mutational process on the genomic  strand of coronaviruses culminating in the compositionally highly abnormal hku1 sequences 15 this appears to have driven the gc content of coronaviruses as low as 32 while remarkably leaving g and a frequencies more or less unaltered fig 7 intriguingly the bat-derived coronaviruses along with the recently zoonotically transferred viruses into humans show the least degree of compositional asymmetry the expansions in apobec gene numbers extensive positive selection and the consequent variability in apobec nucleic acid targeting 23 may indeed create distinct selection pressures on coronaviruses in different hosts the immediate appearance of cu hypermutation in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov genomes in humans may therefore represent the initial effects of replication in a more hostile internal cellular environment than that found in what might be a better coadapted virus-tolerized immune system of a bat 38 zoonotic origins are suspected for other human coronaviruses but at more remote times 39 perhaps they have taken their mutational and adaptive journeys already the 1000 closest matched sequences to the prototype strain of sars-cov-2 nc045512 were downloaded on 24 april 2020 sequences with large internal gaps ambiguous bases and other markers of poor sequence quality were excluded leaving a total of 865 sequences for analysis these were divided into three data samples corresponding to sequences 1 to 300 301 to 600 and 601 to 865 sequences listed in table s1a in the supplemental material an additional data set of 117 well-curated sars-cov-2 sequences was downloaded from konsiliarlabor fr coronaviren httpscivnbinfosequences on 13 april 2020 and represents a further independent sample set

is the trojan horse of coronaviruses mediating their entry into the host cells while sars-cov-2 was becoming a global threat scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures on april 21 st  the gisaid resource had collected 10823 sars-cov-2 genomic sequences we extracted from them all the complete s protein sequences and identified point mutations thereof six mutations were located on a 14-residue segment 929-943 in the fusion core of the heptad repeat 1 hr1 our modeling in the pre-and post-fusion s protein conformations revealed for three of them the loss of interactions stabilizing the post-fusion assembly on may 29 th  the sars-cov-2 genomic sequences in gisaid were 34805 an analysis of the occurrences of the hr1 mutations in this updated dataset revealed a significant increase for the s929i and s939f mutations and a dramatic increase for the d936y mutation which was particularly widespread in sweden and walesengland we notice that this is also the mutation causing the loss of a strong inter-monomer interaction the d936-r1185 salt bridge thus clearly weakening the post-fusion assembly  coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 is a novel virus belonging to the  genus coronaviruses which also include two highly pathogenic human viruses identified in the last two decades the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 1 2 3  coronaviruses are named after the protruding spike s glycoproteins on their envelope giving a crown corona in latin shape to the virions 4  of the four structural proteins of coronavirues s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n the s protein is the one playing a key role in mediating the viral entry into the host cells 5 6 7  making it one of the main targets for the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  comprised of two functional subunits s1 and s2 it first binds to a host receptor through the receptor-binding domain rbd in the s1 subunit and then fuses the viral and host membranes through the s2 subunit 7 15  in the prefusion conformation the sars-cov-2 s protein forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface where its rbd binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the host cell surface 1 like the sars-cov homolog 16  and differently from mers-cov s which recognizes a different receptor the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 17  receptor binding and proteolytic processing by cellular proteases then cause s1 to dissociate and s2 to undergo large-scale conformational changes towards a stable structure bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and infection 7 15 18  while the outbreak of covid-19 was rapidly spreading all over the world affecting millions of people and becoming a global threat laboratories worldwide promptly started to sequence a large number of sars-cov-2 genomes all the available genomic data is accessible through the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid website an invaluable open access resource 19 20  simultaneously crucial structural knowledge has been achieved on sars-cov-2 especially regarding the s protein 3d structures are now available from the protein data bank pdb 21 for the sars-cov-2 s protein in the pre-fusion conformation also bound to the ace2 receptor 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  and for the post-fusion core of its s2 subunit in the postfusion conformation 29  on april 21 st 2020 4 months after the first sequencing 30 10823 genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 were available from gisaid therefore we considered the time ripe for an assessment of the mutational spectrum of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to this aim we extracted all the complete s protein sequences from the gisaid 21 st april dataset and identified all the mutations occurring in at least 2 identical sequences see table s1  from this analysis a 14-amino acid segment in the fusion core of the heptad repeat 1 hr1 emerged as a hotspot for mutations while the mutations we identified corresponded to a 1 mutation every 12 positions along the protein sequence as many as 6 amino acids were found to be mutated in the above 14-amino acid segment s929 d936 l938 s939 s940 and s943 after the proteolytic processing in the post-fusion conformation the s protein hr1 and hr2 motifs interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle 6-hb which promotes initiation of the viral and cellular membranes fusion the hr1 fusion core is named after its role in giving many interactions with hr2 in the post-fusion conformation thus playing a key role in the virus infectivity 31  based on the structural location of the above highly concentrated mutations and on their nonconservative nature we considered them of particular interest and decided to further investigate their structural basis both in the pre-and post-fusion conformation as well as their sequencing dates and geographical distribution as we show in the following as many as three of them are responsible for the loss of inter-monomer hbonds in the post-fusion conformation while one of them s943p would introduce unexpected structural strain in the pre-fusion conformation a search in the gisaid resource updated to may 29 th showed a significant increase in occurrences especially for one mutant d936y unreported to date which has become a common variant in some european countries especially sweden it is also the mutant having the most significant structural role causing the loss of an intermonomer salt bridge in the post-fusion assembly we downloaded the 10823 genomic sequences available from gisaid on april 21 st 2020 from these sequences we extracted the nucleotide sequences of the spike protein and translated them to protein sequences with in-house scripts nucleotides sequences featuring an internal stop codon having at least one undefined n nucleotide or resulting in spike proteins of length different from 1273 amino acids were discarded sequences annotated as pangolin bat or canine were also discarded the remaining 7692 protein sequences were further analysed first we clustered them in sets of identical sequences with cd-hit 32 obtaining 120 clusters of at least 2 sequences and 245 unique sequences as a reference system for further analyses we used the first dated on december 24 th 2019 genomic sequence in gisaid isolated and sequenced in wuhan hubei china 30  then upon alignment to the reference sequence we identified point mutations in all the sets of at least two sequences we downloaded again the 34805 genomic sequences available from gisaid on may 29 th 2020 gisaidhcov-192020052914 and followed the above pipeline to extract 23332 complete 1273-residue long s protein sequences we then recorded the presence and frequency in them of any mutation occurring in the fusion core of the hr1 residues 929-949 with in-house scripts mutants 3d models were built using the mutatemodel module of the modeller 9v11 program 33  this is an automated method for modelling point mutations in protein structures which includes an optimisation procedure of the mutated residue in its environment beginning with a conjugate gradients minimisation continuing with molecular dynamics with simulated annealing and finishing again by conjugate gradients the used force field is charm-22 for details see reference 34  models for mutants in the pre-fusion conformation were built starting from the em structure of the pre-fusion trimeric conformation pdb id 6vsb resolution 346  22 models for mutants in the post-fusion conformation were built starting from the x-ray structure of the s2 subunit fusion core pdb id 6lxt resolution 290  29 molecular models were analysed and visually inspected with pymol 35  the cocomaps web server 36 was used to analyse the inter-chain contacts and hbonds as well as the residues accessibility to the solvent we downloaded all the sars-cov-2 genomic sequences from the gisaid resource on april 21 st 2020 extracted from them 7692 complete s protein sequences and identified all the point mutations occurring in at least two identical sequences see methods the 111 mutations we identified occurring at 105 different positions spread all over the protein sequence are reported in table s1  with the relative number of occurrences while the mutations we identified were spaced on average 12 positions along the protein sequence a segment of 14 amino acids harboured 6 mutations at positions 929 936 938 939 940 and 943 proposing itself as a mutational hotspot this sequence segment is part of the fusion core of the hr1 in the protein s2 subunit the hr1 of coronaviruses s proteins undergoes one of the most notable rearrangements within the protein between the pre-and post-fusion conformations in the post-fusion conformation in fact it experiences a refolding of the pre-fusion multiple helices and intervening regions into a single continuous helix  figure 1  as already mentioned three of these long helices then form a 6hb with three hr2 helical motifs 18 29 31  the hr1 and its fusion core in particular thus play a crucial role in the virus infectivity the following 6 mutations were identified in the fusion core of the hr1 on april 21 st 2020 s929i d936y l938f s939f s940f s943p two of these mutations d936y and s943p were among the most frequent in the ensemble of mutations we identified besides the widespread d614g now dominant over the original d614 variant 37 38  only 5 other mutations two of them being very peripheral l5f and p1263l recurred indeed in  20 sequences see table s1  s943p was also reported in 38  where it was hypothesized to be spreading via recombination the l938f mutation was a particularly late one it was found in 2 sequences associated to the d614g mutation both from england and dated march 29 th  the s929i mutation was found in 2 sequences from usa washington dated march 12 th and 27 th  associated to the d614g mutation finally the s940f mutation had a unique geographical distribution as it was found in 2 sequences from australia new south wales dated february 28 th and march 4 th  not associated to the d614g mutation in addition it was found in 1 single sequence from france dated march 20 th  where it was associated to the d614g mutation in conclusion with the exception of s940f which was found in australia all the mutations in the hr1 core fusion were spread in two continents europe andor north america furthermore most of them originated from the d614g variant this is in agreement with them seeming to be quite late mutations sequenced starting from the end of februarymarch 2020 ie over two months after the first wuhan variant dated december 24 th 2019 30  table 1 the 3-fold increment in frequency of the s929i and s939f mutants was in line with the increment of the sequences in the dataset the three additional occurrences of the s929i mutation were from usa washington wales and england a novel s929t mutation was also reported twice from scotland additional occurrences of the s939f mutation were instead from usa 7 england 2 kazakhstan 1 and uae 1 as for the l938f and s940f mutants their increment was significantly lower than the increment of the sequences in the dataset a positive selection thus clearly hasnt emerged to date for these mutations the only additional occurrence of l938f was from denmark while the 2 additional occurrences of s940f were from france and usa washington the s943p mutation represented a special case most of the sequences harbouring such a mutation were indeed modified between the april 21 st and the may 29 th datasets so that they do not feature anymore the mutation to proline however 3 novel occurrences of the same mutation s943p emerged from china beijing in addition 3 sequences from scotland presented the novel s943i mutation as for the remaining positions of the hr1 fusion core to may 29 th  either they were fully conserved s937 k933 a942 a944 l945 g946 k947 and q949 or they hosted one single occurrence of mutation to valine for a930 to aspartate for i931 and g932 to histidine for q934 and d935 to alanine for t941 and to arginine for l948 because of the rarity of such mutations we will not discuss them here however we will continue to monitor them over time all the amino acids undergoing mutations in the sars-cov-2 s protein are conserved in the bat coronavirus ratg13 s protein sharing an overall sequence identity of 97 with sars-cov-2 s protein while as many as five of them are mutated in the sars-cov-2 s protein overall 76 sequence identical to the sars-cov-2 homolog see figure 1  four of these mutations are however conservative aspartate to glutamate serine to threonine except s929 which is a lysine in sars-cov it has been proposed that such mutations in the sars-cov-2 hr1 may be associated with enhanced interactions with the hr2 further stabilizing the 6-hb structure and maybe leading to increased infectivity of the virus 29  it is noteworthy that no one of the point mutations we identified restored the corresponding sars-cov amino acid in the pre-fusion conformation all the mutated positions but s943 are located on the second of four non-coaxial helical segments composing the hr1 figure 1  four of them s929 d936 s939 and s940 are exposed to the solvent table 2  and can be modelled as larger mostly aromatic residues without causing any structural strain see figure 2  these mutations are not expected to cause relevant changes in the prefusion structure although they could have a destabilizing effect as a consequence of posing large aromatic residues in direct contact with the solvent instead of smaller apolar leucine polar serine in 2 cases or even charged aspartate residues in addition s940 involves its side-chain in a h-bond with the main-chain of d936 4 residues upstream the loss of this h-bond in the s940f mutant also points to a slight destabilization of the pre-fusion conformation as for l938 it is buried in the prefusion conformation pointing towards a three-stranded anti-parallel -sheet made of the s711-p728 segment from the s1 subunit and of the y1047-p1053 and g1059-a1078 segments from the s2 subunit without directly contacting it distances above 5  it can also be modelled as a large phenylalanine without causing sterical strain upon mutation it seems to optimize the hydrophobic interactions with the neighboring residues especially i726 and a944 finally s943 is located on a turn immediately downstream the helical segment hosting the above five mutations between the second and third helical segments the wild-type residue s943 features  and  dihedral angles of 585 and 245 respectively which fall in an unfavourable region for prolines in the s943p model we generated the p943  and  dihedrals assume the values of 30 and 682 placing the residue in an outlier region 39 the favoured  angle for prolines is indeed restricted to the value of -63  15 40 characteristic of -helices a proline at such a position would therefore introduce an anomaly in the pre-fusion conformation while strongly promoting the transition to the post-fusion single continuous helical conformation it is also worth noticing that this would be the only mutation among those we identified so far introducing a proline residue in the sars-cov-2 s protein table s1  in light of the analysis of the gisaid may 29 th updated we also modelled the s943i mutation being isoleucine compatible with the s943 dihedral values this mutation does not result in any structural strain when looking at the post-fusion conformation of the sars-cov-2 spike protein s2 subunit these mutations appear more revealing three of the wild-type residues s929 d936 and s943 are indeed engaged in side-chain to side-chain h-bonds with the hr2 segment of an adjacent monomer in particular s929 d936 and s943 hr1 on chain a are h-bonded to s1196 r1185 and e1182 respectively hr2 on chain c figure 3  these are all strong h-bonds especially the one between s943 and e1182 involving a negatively charged residue and the one between d936 and r1185 being actually a salt bridge estimated to contribute an additional 3-5 kcalmol to the free energy of protein stability as compare to a neutral h-bond 41 all these three h-bonds are lost upon mutation which points to a weakening of the post-fusion assembly of the remaining three mutations s939f is completely exposed to the solvent and therefore like in the pre-fusion conformation expected to act unfavourable on the protein solvation energy on the contrary in case of l938f and s940f which are substantially buried within the structure mutation to a large aromatic phenylalanine seems even to optimize the network of the hydrophobic interactions in case of f940 with the aliphatic parts of the side-chains of e1182 and r1185 on an adjacent monomer and in case of f938 with v1189 and a1190 on the same monomer and with other f938 residues on both the adjacent monomers when comparing the effect of the mutations on the pre-and post-fusion structures it emerges that the s929i d936y and s943i mutations strongly destabilize the postfusion conformation while having a marginal impact on the stability of the pre-fusion one on the contrary s940f seems to favour the post-fusion conformation over the pre-fusion one as for s938f and s939f they seem to have a comparable effect on both the conformations slightly stabilizing and destabilizing respectively finally the s943p mutation would strongly destabilize both the pre-and post-fusion conformations based on a thorough analysis of the s protein sequences that we extracted from the genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 reported in gisaid on april 21 st  we identified the fusion core of the hr1 as a mutational hotspot the d936y and s943p mutations were the most numerous being among the most frequently occurring mutations overall at the time other less frequent mutations were s939f and then s929i l938f and s940f overall such mutations appeared to be late ones emerging starting from the end of february or even mid march 2020 and were mainly localized in europe and usa based on their frequency on their location in a protein region playing a key role in the post-fusion conformation and also on the non-conservative nature of the mutations themselves we decided to further investigate the structural basis of such mutations finding out that they all can play a role in tuning the stability of the preandor post-fusion s protein conformation other potentially interesting mutations are s929i and s939f whose number of occurrences underwent a 23-fold increase on the other hand the increment in the occurrence of l938f and s940f was marginal posing less emphasis on such mutations which will be nonetheless useful to continue monitoring finally the s943p mutation although still reported in few cases underwent a dramatic reduction of occurrences due to modification of the original sequences where they were first reported at the same time a s943i mutation emerged that will also be worth continuing to monitor we remind here that a proline at position 943 would cause a significant destabilization on the s protein pre-fusion conformation it is also worth noticing that the 2 mutations significantly increasing their frequency over time d936y and s929i were also those that together with s943pi caused the loss of a inter-monomer h-bond in the post-fusion conformation of the protein interestingly the now emerging s943i mutation gets the same effect without destabilizing the pre-fusion conformation the most frequently occurring mutation in the hr1 fusion core common in sweden and uk on may 29 th  is also the one causing the loss of a strong inter-monomer salt bridge our structural analyses provide a rationale for such mutations pointing to a weakening of the post-fusion assembly however only experiments on cellular systems will clarify whether this may be a virus strategy for reducing its membrane fusion capacity thus lowering its virulence we gratefully acknowledge all the authors from the originating laboratories responsible for obtaining the

genes in coronavirus genomes and its applications in analyzing sars-cov genomes ling-ling chen hong-yu ou ren zhang chun-ting zhang   six genome sequences of coronaviruses and the annotation information were downloaded from the web site of ncbi refseq project httpwwwncbinihgovrefseq these coronaviruses include avian infectious bronchitis virus nc001451 bovine coronavirus nc003045 human coronavirus 229e nc002645 murine hepatitis virus nc001846 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nc003436 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus nc002306 a total of 48 genes were extracted from the above six genomes and used to train the gene-finding algorithm currently 15 genome sequences of sars coronavirus sars-cov strains are available in the genbank database of which there are 11 complete and four partial genomes respectively the former includes sars-cov tor2 accession no ay274119 urbani ay278741 hku-39849 ay278491 cuhk-w1 ay278554 bj01 ay278488 cuhk-su10 ay282752 sin2500 ay283794 sin2748 ay283797 sin2679 ay283796 sin2774 ay283798 and sin2677 ay283795 whereas the latter includes sars-cov bj02 ay278487 bj03 ay278490 bj04 ay279354 and gz01 ay278489 respectively the gene-finding algorithm presented in this paper is based on the z curve 13 which is a graphic representation of dna sequences the z curve method has been used to recognize protein coding genes in the budding yeast genome 14 a new ab initio gene-finding system for bacterial and archaeal genomes has been developed recently based on the z curve method 12 here the method with some modifications is used to recognize protein coding genes in coronavirus genomes which is presented briefly as follows suppose that the occurrence frequencies of the bases a c g and t u at the first second and third codon positions in an orf are denoted by ai ci gi and t
i respectively where i123 the four numbers ai ci gi and t
i are mapped onto a point in a 3-dimensional space vi with the coordinates1xiaigicitiyiaicigiti i123ziaitigicithen each orf may be represented by a point or a vector in a 9-dimensional space v where vv1v2v3 where the symbol  denotes the direct-sum of two subspaces the nine components u
1u
9 of the space v are defined as follows2u1x1 u2y1 u3z1u4x2 u5y2 u6z2u7x3 u8y3 u9z3
 to train the system two sets of samples are needed which are positive samples corresponding to protein-coding genes seed orfs and negative samples corresponding to non-coding sequences in the z curve method essentially the gene recognition is based on the compositional asymmetry of three codon positions in coding sequences it was shown that the overall extent of codon usage bias in rna viruses is low and there is little variation in bias between genes 15 coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae and the g  c content of the published coronavirus genomes ranges from 37 to 42 7 therefore it is reasonable to deduce that the published coronavirus genomes have similar codon usage based on this consideration it is possible that gene-finding parameters derived from some published coronavirus genomes may be applied to recognize genes in other coronavirus genomes because the sars-cov genomes are relatively small 30 kb it is difficult to obtain enough seed orfs from its own genome therefore we used some other published coronavirus genomes to train gene-finding parameters consequently the genomes of avian infectious bronchitis virus bovine coronavirus human coronavirus 229e murine hepatitis virus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus respectively were used in which 48 seed orfs were selected the detailed information about the 48 seed orfs is described in table 1 of the supplementary materials see httptubictjueducnsars below we describe the strategy to produce the negative samples it is a rather difficult problem to produce an appropriate set of non-coding sequences in coronavirus genomes because the amount of non-coding dna sequences in these genomes is too few to be used a method to produce negative samples has been developed previously and it has been shown to be an effective way to solve the problem 12 the same method is still used in the current study in this method a negative sample is just derived from a seed orf generally speaking if the regular structure of a coding sequence is completely destroyed it is transformed into a non-coding one therefore the negative sample may be simply obtained by shuffling the corresponding coding sequence sufficiently 20000 times in current study the resulting random sequences from all 48 seed orfs were used as non-coding sequences the major difference is that the former has some regular structures whereas the latter is a random sequence in fact a random sequence is not a non-coding sequence but it is a good approximation as shown below this approximation generally results in good gene-finding results the fisher linear equation for discriminating the positive and negative samples in the 9-dimensional space v represents a super-plane described by a vector c which has nine components c
1c
2 and c
9 for more details about fisher discrminant algorithm refer to for example 14 based on the data in the training set including the positive and negative samples the vector c and the threshold c
0 are obtained the decision of codingnon-coding for each orf and negative sample is simply made by the criterion of cuc0cuc0 where cc1c2c9t uu1u2u9t and t indicates the transpose of a matrix the criterion of cuc0cuc0 for making the decision of codingnon-coding can be rewritten as zu0zu0 where zucuc0 zu is called the z score or z index for an orf or a fragment of dna sequence finally the strategy to deal with overlapping orfs used here is similar to that described in the previous paper 12 no coronavirus-specific annotation systems have been available so far currently genemarkhmm is commonly used for gene-finding in virus genomes 10 we submitted the sars-cov tor2 genome to genemarkhmm website using default settings and the prediction result is listed in table 1
 it can be seen that the predicted gene 1 is questionable because of its short length and the lack of a start codon an important structural protein gene small envelope protein e which is located from 26117 to 26347 was not predicted by genemarkhmm moreover we submitted the same genome sequence several times to the website however the prediction results were not identical at all times indicating that the system is unstable an important structural protein gene n protein which is located from 28120 to 29388 was predicted as gene 10 and gene 11 marked with  in table 1 in some predicted results sometimes gene 9 marked with  in table 1 a quite conserved orf in all of the 11 sars-cov genomes mentioned above was not predicted compared with genemarkhmm for gene-finding in the sars-cov genomes the performance of zcurvecov is better see table 3 in the supplementary materials currently the genome sequences of 15 sars-cov strains are available in genbankembl databases of which there are 11 complete and four partially complete genomes the gene-finding software zcurvecov version 10 has been run for each of the 11 complete sars-cov genomes to save space the detailed results are listed in table 3 of the supplementary materials see also the discussion below in addition to the polyprotein chain orfs 1a and 1b the program predicts four structural genes coding for the four major structural proteins ie spike s small envelop e membrane m and nuleocaspid n respectively in all the 11 sars-cov genomes additionally zcurvecov 10 also predicts 56 putative proteins with lengths between 39 and 274 amino acids for the 11 genomes these putative genes might code for non-structural proteins in the sars-cov genomes to compare the gene-finding result of the system zcurvecov 10 with that of known annotation the sars-cov tor2 strain is used as an example the genome of tor2 strain was annotated manually 8 and the annotated result is listed on the left part of table 2
 whereas the annotated result of zcurvecov 10 is listed on the right part of table 2 as we can see both annotations are in good agreement with each other except three orfs the three orfs ie orf4 orf13 and orf14 annotated by marra et al 8 are not predicted by zcurvecov 10 these orfs are completely embedded with a frameshift within the genes coding for some structural proteins the absence of the transcription regulating sequences trss at the 5 end of these orfs 8 suggests that they are unlikely to be the protein-coding genes the principal component analysis performed below further confirms the above conjecture as mentioned in the materials and methods section each orf is represented by a point in a 9-dimensional 9-d space consequently the positive samples genes and negative samples non-coding sequences are represented by two groups of points in the 9-d space respectively for the tor2 strain the 12 putative genes predicted by zcurvecov and orf 4 orf 13 and orf 14 are represented by the corresponding points in the 9-d space respectively we project the points in the 9-d space onto the 3-d space spanned by the first second and third principal axes based on the principal component analysis the fraction of the first three principal components accounts for about 70 of the total inertia of the 9-d space fig 1
shows the distribution of the corresponding points in the 3-d space where green and orange balls represent the positive samples genes and negative samples non-coding sequences respectively blue balls correspond to the genes predicted by zcurvecov for the tor2 strain while red balls correspond to orf 4 orf 13 and orf 14 annotated by marra et al 8 it is clear that the three red balls are located at the side of non-coding sequences indicating that orf 4 orf 13 and orf 14 are very unlikely to code for proteins similar analysis was performed to the urbani strain 7 the result is listed in table 3
 in which the putative gene x2 annotated by rota et al 7 corresponding to orf 4 in marra et al 8 is not predicted by zcurvecov based on the above analysis x2 is also very unlikely to code for a protein of the 11 complete sars-cov genomes six have not yet been annotated we have run the program zcurvecov for each of the 11 genomes consequently those already annotated have been re-annotated and those not annotated yet have been annotated all of the annotated results are listed in table 3 of the supplementary materials to test the nucleotide mutations of the predicted genes coding for non-structural proteins we aligned the coding sequences of sars274 sars63 sars122 sars44 sars39 and sars84 respectively for the 11 complete sars-cov genomes using clustalw 18 17 the results of multiple sequence alignment for the above six predicted genes coding for non-structural proteins are listed in fig 1 of the supplementary materials for the three orfs sars122 sars44 and sars84 the nucleotide sequences are all conserved in the 11 sars-cov genomes indicating that the three orfs might have crucial biological functions mutations in these gene sequences would result in loss of important functions therefore these coding sequences might serve as the candidate targets for designing drugs against sars on the contrary sars39 is not found in the strains sin2677 and sin2748 and a nucleotide mutation occurs at nucleotide position 49 leading to the mutation of cys  arg in the strains bj01 and cuhk-w1 the rapid mutations occurring in sars39 imply that it is probably not a key protein for sars-cov for sars63 two nucleotide mutations are observed at the base positions 38 and 170 leading to amino acid mutations of glu  gly and pro  leu in the strains sin2677 and bj01 respectively see fig 1 in the supplementary materials for the detail the result of clustalw alignment for sars274 is shown in fig 2
 four nucleotide mutations located at 31 302 406 and 783 respectively at three different strains have been detected the first three variations cause amino acid mutations fig 2 the last substitution is a synonymous codon mutation which does not lead to amino acid change the point mutations occurring at nucleotide positions 31 302 and 406 respectively cause amino acid changes at the 31st position g  a tor2  gly  arg similarly at the 302nd position t u  a hku-39849  met  lys and at the 406th position a  c bj01  lys  gln on the other hand it was reported by marra et al 8 that there exist three trans-membrane regions spanning approximately at nucleotide positions 102  168 residues 34  56 231  297 77  99 and 309  375 103  115 respectively in sars274 sequence therefore the mutations occur outside of the predicted trans-membrane regions note that the second mutation of amino acid met  lys is essential as reflected by the fact that met is a relatively strong hydrophilic amino acid whereas lys is a strong hydrophobic one at present we cannot know whether these mutations cause severe conformational changes in the tertiary structure of this putative protein the high mutation rate of sars274 implies that either it might be a relatively unimportant protein for sars-cov or the mutations do not lead to biological function changes dramatically finally for the time being we still cannot rule out the possibility that all or a part of these mutations are caused by sequencing errors the detailed supplementary materials related to this study are available from the website

syndrome sars is an extremely severe disease that has spread to many countries around the world accumulating evidence has shown that sars is caused by a new coronavirus ie sars-cov a new system to recognize protein-coding genes in sars-cov genomes called zcurvecov has been reported in this paper by applying the program to 11 complete sars-cov genomes six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed it is shown that the three protein-coding orfs annotated by marra et al 8 ie

particular individual samples to determine the possible pathogenicity of the detected mutations in ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 genes we used the scores provided by this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved it includes evolutionary constraints structural features and protein annotation information the most important single characteristics for snap prediction is conservation in a family of related proteins as reflected by psic scores if the values are between -100-0 and 0-100 the mutations are considered neutral and effected respectively in the snap software finally the score given by the cosmic 21 httpscancersangeracukcosmic database was used to predict and verify the pathogenic effect of detected mutations evolutionary conservation region analysis was carried out to determine whether the mutations which detected affect the critical amino acid codons for the target proteins the evolutionary conservation analyses of the detected mutant amino acids were evaluated among different species via the multiple sequence alignment tool in the polyphen-2 software gepia httpgepiacancer-pkucnindexhtml is an advanced interactive network supporting normal and tumor tissue samples gene expression profiling and interactive analyses 22 gepia offers customizable features such as differentially expressed tumornormal analysis from the tcga and the gtex genotype-tissue expression databases it is an interactive web server advanced to provide several customizable analyses such as differential gene expression profiling by cancer types or pathological stages survival analysis similar gene detection correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the gene expression profiles of ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 genes were analyzed as box plot graphs created by the gepia database using data from 483 luad and 486 lusc patients and healthy tissue samples obtained from server furthermore the correlation analyses between the expression levels of the ace2 gene and other target genes were performed using the software the p-values were automatically calculated by the software in both analyzes and p-value 005 was established statistically significant the survival analyses of the target genes ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 according to their varying gene expression fluctuations were performed using the web interface all statistical analyses were carried out on the gepia database kaplan-meier curves regarding overall survival low and high expression groups were compared used the log-rank test pearson test was performed for correlation analyses using online database p005 was established a statistically significant in our study genome sequencing data of 1097 luad and lusc cancer patients were selected and analyzed from cbioportal portal in order to detect genetic changes in ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furin pcsk3 genes in luad and lusc patient samples it was determined that 81 of luad and lusc patients who made up our study group had at least one genetic change missense nonsense inframe mutation gene amplification and deep deletion in the target genes when we looked this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved separately at the frequency of genetic anomaly transport in cancer types it was found to be 74 for luad and 98 for lusc a total of 21 mutations 17 missense 2 nonsense 1 splice site and 1 deletion were detected for 4 target genes detailed information about the detected mutations is given in table- codon between these codons appears to be ph34n with missense mutation in the luad cancer group apart from this when we consider functionally mutations it is likely to cause anomaly in ace2 gene expression since the px233splice mutation seen in the lusc patient group is located in the splice region that is 100 protected between species in the evolutionary process the other target gene tmprss2 is a type ii transmembrane serine protease consisting of 492 amino acids expressed on the cell surface and thus ideally positioned to regulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions 23 the binding of the s protein to ace2 triggers a conformational change in the s protein of the coronavirus by allowing proteolytic digestion by host cell this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved proteases tmprss2 thereby infecting the cell by entering the viral rna into the cell in our study a total of 2 mutations 1 missense 1 nonsense gene amplification and deep deletion were detected in the tmprss2 gene the 2 nucleotide detected is on the transmembrane domain in particular the pg19 mutation may cause truncated protein formation as the tmprss2 polypeptide is used early in the codon 19 amino acid another molecule is cd147 used by sars-cov-2 to entrance host cells cd147bsg is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily that plays a role in tumor development plasmodium infestation and virus infection 11 in our study 1 missense mutation pf275v was detected in cd147bsg gene in the luad patient group recently sars-cov-2 has been reported to contain four residues pro681 arg682 arg683 and ala684 as a potential cleavage site for the furinpcsk3 protease of the s protein therefore our fourth target gene in our study is furinpcsk3 it includes 9 nucleotide exchanges 7 missense 1 deletion 1 nonsense mutation as well as gene amplification and deep deletion all of the mutations detected except pl428v missense change were detected in the luad patient group also the pe112 mutation may cause the furinpcsk3 polypeptide to terminate at the codon 11 amino acid causing truncated protein to form in our study the schematic representation of mutations detected in target genes on protein domains were summarized in figure-2  firstly this analysis was carried out by including the missense mutations that we explained in detail in the results of mutation analysis according to our pathogenicity this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved analysis results with the poly-phen2 database program it was determined that 7 of 17 missense mutations given in table-1  damaging because the pathogenic score is close to 1 however as a result of the second analysis made using the snap program 4 of the same missense mutations were identified as being affected by the score between 0-100  figure-3 a-d  in addition a comparison analysis of amino acid sequences affected by missense mutations detected between different species was performed using the multiple sequence alignment option in the poly-phen2 program as a result of this analysis it was determined that pr219p pi256m pl320f pd693n pq183k pe230d pg277w pl420l pl428v and py495q mutations were conserved due to being on evolutionarily critical conserved amino acids in figure 3  only missense mutations of ace-2 were included all of the conjectural pathogenic features and evolutionary conservation analyzes which were conducted by using the poly-phen2 software has been presented elaborately in figure-3 a-d  the m-rna expression analysis was performed to determine whether 483 luad and 486 lusc patients differ in ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 gene expression profiles compared to the healthy sample group according to the results of our analysis ace2 and cd147bsg gene expression levels are high in both cancer groups although not statistically significant in healthy patient samples however in our lusc patient group statistically significantly tmprss2 gene expression was found to be lower in the patient group compared to the healthy sample group there is no significant difference for furinpcsk3 in both cancer groups this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved  figure 4a-d  in addition the relationship between tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 expression results and the expression profile of ace2 was evaluated separately by pearson correlation test and no correlation was detected figure 5  according to our results of survival analysis the overall survival times of those with low tmprss2 expression in the luad cancer group are statistically significantly longer than those with high levels figure 6 p004  since the first case detected in december 2019 a new coronavirus causing covid-19 disease has led more than 3500000 infections worldwide and about 245000 deaths 24 deaths caused by this pandemic affected more people with many critical diseases including cancer cancer patients have vary susceptibility to infectious and varying responses to pathogen invasion to host cells regulated gene expression and mutation development in the related genes gene expression and mutation profile may show variability between individuals depending on various parameters such as therapy regimen age and immune system condition cancer patients may at a higher risk of being more susceptible to covid-19 infectious diseases recent studies have shown that ace2 and cellular protease tmprss2 play a role in the entry of sars-cov-2 into lung cells 6 7 8 23 25 our study is complementary to the lack of information in the literature in order to make a comparative evaluation of the mutation and gene expression profiles of ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 genes in luad and lusc patient groups the study of ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3s genomic and functional expression variants for potential susceptibility andor resistance to this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved coronavirus infection is not particularly available in the literature first of all mutation profiles of target genes including ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 from the genome sequencing results of the luad and lusc patient which are accessible in tgca data sets were analyzed extensively in our analysis results it was determined that 81 of luad and lusc patients had genetic abnormalities and ace2 was the most mutating gene among these four target genes however when cancer groups are evaluated separately our results show that the frequency of carrying genetic anomalies is higher for the lusc group we detected mutations in sequences encoding important domains of target genes in both types of cancer in the lusc patient group the px233splice site mutation in the ace2 gene is able to prevent a functional transcript from occurring because it disrupts splicing activity but these results must be confirmed by wet laboratory studies in particular missense mutations in ace2 and furinpcsk3 genes are likely to be capable of impairing the function of the protein to occur due to the fact that they affect critical amino acids that are conserved among species throughout the evolutionary process in addition deep deletions in all four target genes indicate that genes are likely to be homozygous deletions and in this case gene expression may be impressive gene amplification detected in ace2 and furinpcsk3 genes can cause uncontrolled and excessive gene expression hoffman et al reported that tmprss2 showed that sars-cov-2 is required for the interaction of s protein with ace2 receptor and the entry and propagation of sars-cov-2 into the host cell tmprss2 pg19 nonsense mutation is truncating mutation and we think that tmprss2 protein synthesis will cause deficientimmature enzyme formation with the formation of stop codon before the completion of this condition and this may lead to disruption in protein function this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved particularly genetic variants in ace2 are thought to affect the interaction of rbd on the sars-cov-2 spike protein it is known that a total of 18 amino acids q24 t27   k31 h34 e37 d38 y41 q42 l45 l79 m82 y83 n90 q325 e329 n330 k353 and g354 on ace2 are the binding sites with rbd experimental and bioinformatics based studies are carried out on the fact that the mutationsvariants in these localizations will be able to change the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 in our study there are several reasons why the lung appears to be the most vulnerable target organ for this virus the first is that the large surface area of the lung makes the lung quite susceptible to the inhaled viruses but also a biological factor plays a role as a second cause zhao et al showed that 83 of ace2-expressing cells were alveolar epithelial type ii cells aecii suggesting that these cells can be used as a reservoir for sars-cov-2 invasion 26 the expression of the ace2 receptor outside of the lung is known to be found in many extra pulmonary tissues including the heart kidney endothelium and intestine 2 4 28 in our study according to the expression profile analysis of ace2 tmprss2 cd147bsg and furinpcsk3 genes in the luad and lusc groups it was determined that the expression of tmprss2 was significantly lower especially in the lusc patient group compared to the healthy group and the luad group luad can provide the patient group with protective this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved properties against sars-cov-2 invasion ace2 and cd147bsg expressions show higher expression in both groups compared to the healthy group but this enhanced expression is not statistically significant some research groups reported that ace2 expression showed a positive correlation to sars-cov-2 infection in experimental studies 6 7 25 29 the gene expression level of ace2 may indicate that it is susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and that tmprss2 plays a supporting role furthermore we conducted a low tmprss2 expression resulted in significantly longer overall survival times in the luad cancer patients therefore assessment of the tmprss2 gene downregulated expression only may useful for predicting prognosis and susceptibility to covid-19 in these patient group we concluded that increased expression of ace2 and cd147bsg and decreased this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved nonetheless integrating expression and mutation patterns of virus invasion genes with defined correlation may prove highly informative as highlighted by the successful application of in silico analysis to understand lung cancer subtypes variations in possible

viruses and cells vero cells were maintained in complete dmem supplemented with 10 newborn calf serum the chicken fibroblast cell line umnsahdf1 was purchased from atcc crl-12203 the beaudette strain of ibv was purchased from atcc and propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages the virus was then adapted to grow and passage on vero cells for 65 passages at 37 c 
rt-pcr and sequencing viral rna was extracted from infected cell cultures or purified virions using the rneasy mini kit qiagen according to the manufacturers instructions rt-pcr was performed using the expand reverse transcription and high fidelity pcr kits roche viral rna extracted from the amniotic fluid of infected embryos was amplified by rt-pcr and cloned into pcr21-topo vector invitrogen pcr products or cdna clones were sequenced by automated sequencing 
immunofluorescent staining of ibv-infected vero cells confluent cells were infected with viruses and incubated at 37 c for 1015 h cells were fixed in 4 paraformaldehydepbs and permeabilized with 02 triton x-100pbs immunofluorescent staining was performed by incubating cells with rabbit anti-ibv serum and subsequently with fitc-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy 
sdspage and western blot analysis proteins were separated by sdspage and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-ibv n antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin dako and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence ecl detection reagents amersham the beaudette strain of ibv grown in chicken embryos was adapted to and serially propagated on monkey kidney cell line vero cells for 65 passages 16 a typical cytopathic effect cpe of coronaviruses the formation of giant syncytial cells was observed 2 days postinfection on the fourth passage and plaques formed 3 days postinfection after first three blind passages on vero cells immunofluorescent staining of vero cells infected with the third passage ep3 in chicken embryos p1 vero cell passage 4 p4 6 p6 15 p15 36 p36 and 65 p65 showed that approximately 1 3 5 30 70 and 75 cells respectively were positive fig 1
a except in p1 the majority of these positive cells are in the form of syncytial cells fig 1a these results clearly show that gradually increased infectivity of the virus to vero cells was obtained to assay the fusogenicity of the s protein derived from different passages of ibv the s gene from ep3 p15 p36 and p65 was cloned into a plasmid under the control of a t7 promoter and expressed in vero cells using a vacciniat7 expression system as shown in fig 1b the s protein of ep3 did not cause cellcell fusion and syncytial formation massive cellcell fusion and syncytial formation were observed in cells expressing s protein derived from p15 p36 and p65 under the condition used in this experiment no apparent difference in the fusogenicity of the s protein derived from p15 p36 and p65 was observed fig 1b these results demonstrate that adaptation of ibv to vero cells increases the fusogenicity of the s protein determination of the complete genomic rna sequence of the dominant ep3 strain and plaque-purified p65 was carried out the complete nucleotide sequences of these two ibv strains were submitted to genbank and the accession nos dq001338 for ep3 and dq001339 for p65 compared to ep3 a total of 49 amino acid substitutions were found in p65 among them 26 5306 are in the s protein to gain more information on the chronological order of the accumulation of these mutations in the s protein the nucleotide sequences of s protein derived from the dominant strains of ep3 p7 and p15 and plaque-purified p35 p50 and p65 were determined compared to the prototype ep3 26 point mutations at the nucleotide level were found in p7 and p15 which cause 25 amino acid substitutions table 1
 an additional amino acid substitution g405d405 was accumulated at p35 which was also fixed at p50 and p65 in addition the amino acid residue at position 246 was mutated from i246t246 in p7 p15 p35 and p50 table 1 this amino acid was found to be mutated to s246 in p65 table 1 these results indicated that the selection process or accumulation of mutations was largely accomplished and fixed at p7 suggesting that adaptation of ibv from chicken embryo to a monkey kidney cell line either induces rapid and dramatic changes in the s protein or leads to rapid selection of a fitter variant to test whether the rapid emergency of a vero cell-adapted strain that grows well and becomes dominant after as short as seven passages on vero cells is due to the accumulation of mutations or by selection of pre-existing minor variants viral rna was purified from the amniotic fluid of chicken embryos infected with chicken embryo passage 2 the s protein region was then amplified by rt-pcr and cloned into pcr-21-topo vector twenty-seven clones were randomly selected and sequenced as shown in table 2
 sequence heterogeneity of s protein was observed among the 27 clones sequenced 21 778 clones ep3 show identical sequence to the ep3 sequence shown in table 1 at both nucleotide and amino acid levels two 74 clones ep3v1 have differences at 13 amino acid positions in the s1 region from amino acids 38 to 181 table 2 interestingly these 13 amino acids are identical to the amino acid sequences of the dominant p7 and later passages at the same positions as listed in table 1 four more clones with amino acid differences in the s2 region were also identified from this analysis as can be seen two clones 74 ep3v2 were found to have mutations at seven amino acid positions in the s2 region from amino acids 623 to 1012 table 2 the other two clones 74 ep3v3 with mutations at five amino acid positions in the same region were also found table 2 these mutations are identical to mutations found at the same positions in the dominant p7 and later passages as listed in table 1 these results suggest that the dominant vero cell-adapted virus may be derived by recombination between the two minor variants ep3v1 and ep3v2 in chicken embryo with accumulation of seven additional mutations in the region from amino acids 246 to 391 similar approach was used to amplify the s protein region from p7 p12 and p14 five clones were isolated from p7 and p12 each and 8 clones from p14 sequencing analysis showed that all of these clones have nucleotide and amino acid sequences at these positions identical to those the dominant vero cell-adapted strain listed in table 1 no minor variants were isolated from these three passages by this analysis to further test if sequence heterogeneity of s protein existed in vero cell-adapted passages p20 and p36 were subjected to plaque purification eleven plaques for each of p20 and p36 were randomly selected the s gene of each purified virus clone was amplified and sequenced among these clones 10 out of 11 91 have the identical mutations as the dominant p7 listed in table 1 which carry 18 p20 amino acid substitutions in the s1 region and 7 in the s2 region interestingly one unique isolate from each passage p20c22 and p36c12 has the identical s protein sequence as the minor variant ep3v2 except with an unchanged phe residue at amino acid position 692 table 2 these results showed that the virus population remained to be a quasispecies even after successful adaptation to the new host cells it also indicates that the five mutations in the s2 region are sufficient for the variant to acquire infectivity and cell-to-cell membrane fusion of vero cells as both variants grow well and induce syncytial formation 16 it is reasonable to assume that the variants without mutations in the s1 region could bind to receptors and enter the new host cells see table 2 the infectivity of the vero cell-adapted strain to its original host cells was then checked by infection of a chicken fibroblast cell line umnsahdf1 with ep3 and p65 respectively the formation of cpe was examined by microscopy and the viral protein expression was analysed by western blot with anti-n antibodies as shown in fig 2a both ep3 and p65 can infect umnsahdf1 cells but the infected cells showed different cpe in cells infected with ep3 cell rounding up and lysis are the prominent cpe observed the infected areas were usually restricted fig 2
a in cells infected with p65 the prominent cpe is the formation of large syncytial cells fig 2a western blot analysis showed the detection of n protein in cells infected with ep3 and p65 respectively fig 2b gradually increased detection of the n protein in cells infected with ep3 was observed over a time-course experiment fig 2b lanes 15 interestingly more efficient detection of the n protein was observed in cells infected with p65 fig 2b lane 6 as the vero cell-adapted ibv strain can also efficiently infect chicken embryo 16 these results suggest that mutations in the s protein broaden the host range specificity of ibv and might increase the infectivity of the virus to its original host cells rna viruses are characterized by their high mutation rate due to the lack of proofreading activities of the replicases 11 12 this high mutation rate results in the formation of a heterogeneous population often described as a quasispecies 6 when switching to a new host the pre-existing quasispecies with a mixed population of rna genomes would enable these viruses to respond very quickly to the changing environment high mutation rates per generation coupled with the change of host cells would then help to fix the mutations in this report we test the adaptability of avian coronaviruses ibv from its native chicken host to monkey cells through serial passages after adaptation more than 5306 2649 of mutations were located in the s gene which caused amino acid changes more interestingly the majority of these mutations were fixed as early as at passage 7 to form a dominant vero cell-adapted strain the highly selective and concentrative mutations in the s protein support that s gene and its product play important roles in viral acquisition of a new host and that beneficial mutations in s protein are required for virus to enter the new target cells and spread infection how is this dominant strain derived evidence presented in this report supports that it may be derived by selection of pre-existing minor variants and by recombination between minor variants the selective pressure in this case was the initial low infectivity of the virus to a new host cell and the lack of membrane fusion of the virus during the first few passages several blind passages on vero cells were needed before the viral rna became detectable and typical cpe appeared the detection of single isolated infected cells at p1 suggested that pre-existing minor variants in the prototype population could enter the new host cell and replicate though at low efficiency the existence of minor variants was confirmed by sequencing of viral rna extracted from ep3 and by isolation of minor variants in p20 and p36 interestingly the minor variants isolated from p20 and p36 share almost identical sequence with one minor variant ep3v1 identified in ep3 the fact that these minor variants co-exist with the dominant strains long after the virus was well adapted to the new host cells demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of the quasispecies more importantly comparison of the amino acid sequences of ep3v1 and ep3v2 with the dominant vero cell-adapted strain suggests that the dominant vero cell-adapted strain may be derived by a recombination event between ep3v1 and ep3v2 and by simultaneous accumulation of a few more mutations coronavirus s protein is an important determinant for host specificity and tissue tropism this is largely determined by the cellular distribution and abundance of its receptors a diverse group of cellular proteins has been identified as receptors for different coronaviruses including angiotensin-converting enzyme ii and cd209l l-sign for sars-cov 8 10 aminopeptidase n for human coronavirus-229e porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus feline infectious peritonitis virus and canine coronavirus 5 22 and carcioembryonic antigen-related adhesion molecule for mouse hepatitis virus 21 to date the cellular receptors for ibv has not been identified in its native or adapted host cells based on studies with other coronaviruses 14 18 the receptor binding domain of ibv s protein may also reside in the s1 region mutations in the s1 region would change receptor-binding properties of the s protein and be responsible for the broadened host range specificity of the vero cell-adapted virus presumably due to its increased binding affinity to the receptor intriguingly the two minor variants p20c22 and p36c12 have almost identical amino acid sequence in the s1 region to the dominant ep3 strains and showed similar growth properties to the dominant vero cell-adapted strain after purified by plaque-purification 16 suggesting that receptor-binding affinity alone may not be the only factor that determined the host range of the virus it also indicates that a mammalian counterpart could be used as a receptor for ibv though at low affinity this molecule may share structural and functional similarity with that of the native receptor on chicken cells the s protein-mediated viruscell and cellcell fusion is another essential requirement for viral entry into host cells and for spread of infection to the neighbouring cells this membrane-fusion activity is mainly associated with domains in the s2 region 1 though residues in the s1 region may also be involved 19 the minor variant ep3v1 has only 7 amino acid difference in the s1 region from the dominant vero cell-adapted strain and would have a comparatively higher binding affinity to vero cells than the other minor variant ep3v2 as no amino acid mutations were accumulated in the s2 region this minor variant was lost during adaptation of ep3 to vero cells however ep3v2 shares seven amino acid substitutions in the s2 region but with identical s1 region with the dominant ep3 it co-adapted with the dominant vero cell-adapted strain until p36 as some of these mutations are located in the heptad repeat 1 and 2 region these mutations may alter the fusogenic properties of the s protein it suggests that the ability to mediate membrane fusion is also important for ibv to cross this species barrier recombination between ep3v1 and ep3v2 plus accumulation of several additional mutations in the s1 region led to the formation of the dominant vero cell-adapted ibv this virus shows a broadened host range specificity and can induce efficient cellcell fusion in the new host cells  characterizations of sars-cov-2 mutational profile spike protein stability and viral transmission sayantan laha joyeeta chakraborty shantanab das soumen manna

2020 corona-viruses are a class of genetically diverse viruses found in a wide range of host species like mammals and birds drosten et al 2003 resta et al 1985 sars-cov-2 is an enveloped virus and comprises a positive sense single-strand rna genome of 30 kb kim et al 2020 this sars-cov-2 also belongs to the genus betacoronavirus like sars-cov and mers-cov primarily it was thought to cause infections in birds and other mammals but recent outbreaks have revealed the ability of coronaviruses to cross species barriers and human transmission menachery et al 2017 coronaviruses carry the largest genome among all rna viruses and each viral transcript consists of a 5-cap structure and a 3 poly-a tail lai and stohlman 1981 after entry to the host cell the genomic rna is translated to produce non-structural proteins nsps from two open reading frames orfs on the other hand the viral genome is also used as a template for replication and transcription via rna-dependent rna polymerase activity in the intermediate stage negative-strand rna intermediates are produced to serve as a template for positive-sense genomic rna and sub-genomic rna synthesis these shorter sub-genomic rnas encode the structural proteins ie spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid protein and several other accessory proteins snijder et al 2016 sola et al 2015 dongwan kim et al 2020 the mutation rate for rna viruses is drastically high and this higher mutation rate is correlated with a virulence which is beneficial for viral adaptation duffy 2018 the sars-cov-2 genome has the capability of gaining rapid mutations as the virus spreads lu et al 2020 the advantage of the increasing amount of whole-genome sequence data of sars-cov-2 intrigued us to explore the mutation profile across the genome to check the genome diversity and to investigate the consequences of those mutations on stability and transmission in this present study we used 660 complete sars-cov-2 genome data from ncbi virus database 16th april 2020 for in-silico analysis we performed gene and protein sequence alignment and characterized the mutation status of all genes the most conserved and variable regions were recognized for all genes along with synonymous and non-synonymous changes as non-synonymous changes dictate the altered amino acid composition a collection of all mutations for each protein has been determined we cataloged these substitutions for all proteins and identified different variants that are prevalent in nature we also evaluated the impact of mutating spike glycoprotein in protein

this purpose we have used swiss-model httpsswissmodelexpasyorg homology modelling online server with spike glycoprotein sequence uniprtid p0dtc2 and three individual pdbs were used as a template to generate three conformations the models were refined by openmm7 eastman et al 2017 with charmm27 force-field mackerell jr et al 2004 implemented in the swiss-model server the models were further validated by rampage lovell et al 2003 which shows 9192 residues are in the favoured region and 67 are in the allowed region in the phi-psi map of all the three models structural analyses and figures have been generated in discovery studio 2020 dassault system biovia corp dassault systmes biovia 2016 to study the impact of non-synonymous mutations in the transmission and viability of the newly emerging sars-cov-2 sequences across the world we looked into nextstrain tool a powerful visualization tool comprising 10000 sars-cov-2 samples to study the evolution of various pathogens httpsnextstrainorg hadfield et al 2018 the frequency of occurrence the date of collection and the corresponding geographical location of the mutant strains was noted on 27th april 2020 please note that the genotype information on nextstrain are not consistent on different dates at least for some residues major amino acid substitutions were mapped and visualized in the phylogeny from nextstrain next hcov-19 app minor less frequently mutated residues that showed variations in nextstrain data compared to ncbi virus database were excluded from the analysis amino acid residues of orf1ab were split as orf1a from 1 to 4400 and the rest as orf1b in nextstrain next hcov-19 app to understand the implications of the amino acid substitutions in the mutants charge state at neutral ph kyte-doolittle hydropathy indices kyte and doolittle 1982 and granthams mean chemical difference indices which takes into account side-chain chemical structure volume and polarity grantham 1974 were compared stabilities of their side-chains between exposed and buried forms were compared using apparent partition energies as reported by wertz and scheraga wertz and scheraga 1978 the typical contributions of a putative h-bond and salt-bridge towards protein stabilities were assumed to be in the range of 0515 kcalmol pace et al 2014 sheu et al 2003 pace 1995 and 3 kcalmol nayek et al 2014 based on previous studies on protein folding after aligning the individual orfs of the sars-cov-2 genome we identified mutations both at gene and protein levels table 1
 at the gene level the number of mutations per 100 bases was found to be relatively high in n orf10 orf6 orf7a orf8 and orf3a suggesting that these genes may be more prone to mutations as compared to others among the structural proteins m and e proteins contained the least variability which indicated that these proteins may be associated with housekeeping functions and consequently have a greater resistance to mutations looking into the changes per 100 amino acids for each of the proteins table 1 we observed that orf3a exhibited the highest mutability closely followed by n and orf8 while looking into the synonymous and non-synonymous changes we have found that the orf1ab and spike protein contained the largest number of non-synonymous mutations table 1 when we normalized with respect to the length orf3a orf8 and n exhibited a relatively high number of non-synonymous changes considering the altered protein sequences due to non-synonymous changes we next focused on amino acid substitutions among all proteins of the sars-cov-2 genome supplementary table 1 an abridged version of the table containing only those substitutions that have been observed in a minimum of 10 isolates 15 of the total isolates is provided in fig 1 among the structural proteins e and m showed most conserved structures across all the viral genomes under consideration with substitutions at two sites of each e and m proteins only in 1and5isolatesrespectively upon examining the s proteins we have found several mutations nevertheless most of these substitutions are perceived only in a single isolate with notable exceptions being the d614g there have been 264 41 instances of d614g suggesting its pivotal role in regards to the protein stability and other key characteristics among the other changes v483a l5f q675h h655y and s939f occurred in 6 5 3 2 and 2 isolates respectively the n protein also depicted substitutions r203k and g204r 
among the non-structural proteins orfs 6 7a and 10 shared similar behavior to e and m proteins with them being mostly conserved in contrast orf3a exhibited non-synonymous mutations the majority of which had mostly been distributed at 2residues q57h and g251v mutations in orf8 showed a major substitution at l84s and an accompanied change of v62l another substitution s24l was observed in 25 samples out of the 660 sequences analysed we moved on to the largest encoded sars-cov-2 protein orf1ab that encodes replicase polyproteins required for viral rna replication and transcription ziebuhr 2005 orf1a and orf1b encode two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab and finally processed into 16 nsps fig 1 ziebuhr 2005 chen et al 2020 majority of the non-synonymous mutations at orf1ab led to amino acid changes at the 265th 4725th 5828th and 5865thresidues t265i p4715l p5828l and y5865c notably l5828p and c5865y occurred simultaneously in all strains suggesting a possible functional relationship between these two residues to identify the variants that are prevalent over time we next determined the frequently mutated residues that occurred at least 15 of the samples the combined analysis of all proteins with these frequently mutated residues identified 20 possible sars-cov-2 variants among which 15variants comprised more than 97 of the analysed sequences having frequency  1 table 2
 apart from the wild type variant 133 other frequent sars-cov-2 variants are orf8l84sorf1abp5828ly5865c 306 sd614gorf3aq57horf1abt265ip4715l 204 sd614gorf3aq57horf1abp4715l 72 orf8l84s 46 and sd614gorf1abp4715l46 we noted that g251v of orf3a v62l of orf8 d75e p971l p5828l y5865c and f6158l of orf1ab substitutions occurred only with the d614 wild type variant of the s protein while substitutions r203k and g204r of n protein q57h of orf3a s24l of orf8 t265i p4715l and v5550l of orf1ab occurred only with the d614g mutant of s protein co-occurrences of these mutations might have implications in direct structural interactions or indirect regulations of these proteins on the survivability of the virus to further validate these findings we visualized these major substitutions by observing the phylogeny of sars-cov-2 in nextstrain which contains a curated database of more than 10000 sars-cov-2 sequences depicted in the form of phylogenetic trees fig 2
 we observed the variants that contained these specific substitutions are mostly clustered together for s protein the proportion of the samples with d614g substitutions was roughly equal to that of wild type variant which showed the adaptability of this substitution for orf1b we assessed the substitutions at positions 314 1427 and 1464 which corresponded to 4715th 5828th and 5865thresidues of orf1ab mapping of all frequently mutated residues of orf1a and orf1b on the phylogeny of sars-cov-2 is presented in supplementary fig 1 as observed previously substitutions at 5828th and 5865th position co-occurred even in this large sample set of nextstrain data viral variants with residues lpy ppy and plc dominated the bulk of the sequences which showed that the conjoined mutations either py or lc at 5828th and 5865th residues were linked with increasing survivability fig 2 interestingly we could not overlook the fact that the two representations of the mutations for both s protein and orf1b were remarkably co-occurring we have seen that those variants that have d614g substitutions in s also have lpy residues at 314 1427 and 1464 positions of orf1b it suggested that these residues in s and orf1b irrespective of whether they have occurred simultaneously show good viability fig 2 when focusing on the d614 residue in s protein the most prevalent variant was with ppy at all the three positions of orf1b with exception of few variants with plc residues looking into the mutation profile of n we have found that the wild type variants rg at 203 and 204 positions appeared to be predominant comparison with mutation profile of s protein identified co-occurrence of 614g variant with kr at 203rd and 204th positions of n protein fig 2 we checked the mutation status at positions 75 and 265 of orf1a protein we withheld the inclusion of the 971stsite here as we had seen that substitutions at this site and the 75th residue were co-linked ie they were mostly identical fig 2 we noticed that the wild type variants formed the majority with few isolates of d75e mutants a fairly good number of samples with t265i substitutions of orf1a were also observed having d614g substitutions of s protein comparing the mutational profile with the orf3a at 57th and 251st positions we again found a stark resemblance to both these profiles we saw that the di variant in orf1a mostly went hand-in-hand with hg variants in orf3a fig 2 viewing the mutational profile of orf8 with respect to positions v62l and l84s occurred mostly with the d614 of s protein while s24l occurred with the g variants also observed in our analysis with 660 samples overall the mutation profile that we identified with 664 samples showed excellent concordance with the nextstrain data comprising 10000 samples we compared these frequently mutated residues with the corresponding protein sequences of bat coronavirus ratg13 pangolin coronavirus sars coronavirus tw11 and gd01 table 2 all these frequently mutated residues completely matched with bat coronavirus ratg13 the notable exceptions in here being mismatches at positions 265 971 and 3606 of orf1a in case of pangolin coronavirus and mismatches in all three residues of orf8 in both the sars-cov isolates parameters for 17 frequently mutated residues and v483a substitution at the receptor-binding domain of s protein that may affect the protein structures are presented in table 3
 only 3 out of these 18 substitutions were associated with any change in the charge of the side chain the change in apparent side-chain partitioning energy varied from 279 to 313 kcalmol the maximum expected difference in the number of h-bond and salt bridges associated with mutations were 4 and 1 respectively while only 3 variants could have changed in salt-bridge interactions 8 of them could potentially have a difference in h-bonding reflecting the fact that average energy associated with a salt-bridge interaction is much higher the relative abundance of a mutation can be taken as a surrogate of viral viability which would be dictated by the effect of the mutation on protein stability and its function with respect to specific biomolecular events during host-pathogen interaction the relative abundance of the d614g mutant 698 was the highest the partitioning energy difference was minimal 01 kcalmol indicating that unless the sidechain of d614 was involved in any consequential h-bond this mutant could be as viable as the parent strain the analysis of the larger nextstrain dataset indicated that d614g mutation is significantly more prevalent indeed the high relative abundance 675 of the l84s mutant orf8 could be due to additional h-bond or favourable partitioning energy t265i and y5865c mutants of orf1ab associated with removal of an alcoholic -oh group which is often associated with a modest contribution to protein stability pace et al 2014 sheu et al 2003 pace 1995 showed a similar relative abundance of 343 and 437 respectively however the s24l mutant orf8 showed a significant decrease in abundance this may be attributed to a more unfavorable change in apparent partitioning energy by 2 kcalmol due to a significant difference in chain length of serine and leucine the significant decrease in abundance of g204r n protein in spite of the potential for additional h-bonding may also be attributed to significantly larger chain length however the v483a s protein v62l orf8 v5550l and d75e orf1ab mutants with relatively low values of differences in granthams index or kyte-doolittle index and comparable h-bonding or salt-bridge capacity showed a dramatic decrease in relative abundance while p4715l and p5828l mutants showed relatively high abundance 392 and 292 respectively p971l showed only 27 abundance interestingly both f6158l and l3606f with very low differences in granthams index and reversal in the difference in apparent partitioning energy showed low abundance we have encountered several different variants pertaining to s protein of sars-cov-2 apart from d614g and some co-occurring mutations other changes have been observed in a few cases eg l5f occurring in 5 strains v483a in 6 strains while among others most of these substitutions were observed in a single strain by performing the stability analysis of spike glycoprotein for mutating residues that are available in all three pdb file we found that some of the variants are stable in nature corresponding to negative total energies calculated for both open closed as well as prefusion models table 4 supplementary table 2 among 22 analysed substitutions in s protein 9 structures showed a reduction in total free energy in all three conformations mutants s50l and h49y showed the most reduction in total free energy while all mutants with d614g substitutions showed stabilizing structure suggesting its prevalent role in spike protein evolution interestingly reduction in solvation polar energy was found in only 5 structures including the d614g mutant detailed information for the differences in energy for all residues are presented in supplementary table 2 
to further understand the implication of these mutants we have analysed all three structures of s walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020 gui et al 2017 the spike glycoprotein is a homo-trimeric protein walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020 gui et al 2017 having two subunits s1 and s2 in each monomer protruding from the viral surface s1 subunit forms a budding head responsible for hostreceptor binding while s2 is mainly a stalk-like structure that helps in the fusion of viral and host membranes fig 3a s proteins are cleaved at the s1s2 interface but remain non-covalently linked with each other in the prefusion state gui et al 2017 s1 subunit can further be divided into sub-domains namely n-terminal domain ntd residues 15261 c-terminal domains 1 2 and 3 ctd1 residues 320516 ctd2 residues 517579 ctd3 residues 580663 fig 3a ctd1 which is the main region of s protein for host-receptor interaction is also termed as the receptor-binding domain rbd walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020 gui et al 2017 rbd undergoes conformational changes during receptor binding human ace2 that leads to the blossom of the s1 bud in an open or up conformation conducive for s-ace2 interaction comparing the inert down and active up conformations pdbid s 6vxx and 6vyb respectively it is found that rbd moves as a rigid-body in a hinge bending motion around its linker region with ntd and ctd2 with all-atom rmsd for 198 residues is around 28  fig 3b a similar change of conformation is also observed in prefusion state wrapp et al 2020 the miss-sense mutations in s protein are mainly single point mutations with few double mutations all these mutations can be classified as stabilizing and destabilizing based on the free-energy changes table 4 of the in-silico generated mutant structures wrt the wild type variant li et al 2020 fig 1 our study depicts that there are no stabilizing mutations in the receptor-binding domain rbd fig 4a b this observation indicates that the mechanism of s protein for a high affinity human ace2 binding is unique in nature and any mutation found to date leads to an unstable structure and this could be correlated with lower viability of these mutations containing isolates there are 42 miss-sense mutations found in s protein we have considered 21 of them that are available in every monomer structure of s protein as well as in three pdbs out of these 32 are in the s1 subunit and only 10 are found in the s2 subunit the cryo-em structure of the protein 6vxx shows a high thermal parameter for the ntd and rbd fig 4d the high-temperature factor of rbd could be correlated with its dynamic nature leading to the conformational switch between close and open states it is also observed that most of the stabilizing mutations are in the ntd which is an inherently unstable domain as depicted from the high thermal parameter this observation puts an open question whether the virus adopts viability through mutations stabilizing the flexible ntd d614g substitution in ctd3 is found to be very stable and prevalent in nature it occurs either as a single mutation or coupled with other mutations l54fd614g d614gd936y and d614gs939f surprisingly l54f is a sort of neutral in terms of free energy change mutation however when coupled with d614g the double mutant becomes a stable one table 4 the structural comparison of wild-type and in-silico generated d614g mutant shows that a change from aspartic acid to glycine alters the electro-static potential of the surface of the protein fig 5a this change creates a favourable environment in a hydrophobic pocket of the s protein fig 5b moreover we have also observed that d614 is at the proximity of the hinge bending region ctd2ntd linker of rbd fig 5c therefore mutation of d to a small residue g without any side-chain might increase the flexibility for a smooth switch over from inactive down state to the active up state makes the mutant containing variants more virulent in terms of its smoother binding with ace2 among these multiple variants the ones that are occurring in a large fraction of the samples can be said to have adapted while those strains which only existed with very few samples were likely to get eliminated in the way of selective process and are not generally perceived among the emerging variants this implies that the favourable variants should be associated with greater stability andor higher transmission rates of the sars-cov-2 proteins while a decreased stability or transmission rate is expected in the case of the minor variants looking into the spatial and temporal distribution of these variants of s protein in nextstrain and noting down the number of occurrences of each variant along with the country it originated with the corresponding date table 5
 we find that the variant with d614g substitution is characterized by greater viability across different countries as seen over a span of time first originating on 24th december 2019 and prevailing since last recorded date this mutation was also accompanied by l54f d936y and s939fin different isolates however all these variants are observed in multiple samples which show that the change at the 614th residue is the impactful one which is imparting greater stability to the mutant protein on the other hand the less stable mutants that were found only in a few samples did not show such prevalence and were seen to be dwindling out with time we have performed a thorough mutational characterization encompassing the variations occurring in all orfs of the sars-cov-2 genome among structural proteins both the membrane and envelope proteins are more resilient to frequent mutations while among non-structural proteins orfs 6 7a and 10 shared similar behavior to e and m proteins with them being mostly conserved this signifies that these proteins could have some essential functions perhaps housekeeping roles that are critical to the virus which is why these sequences cannot generally withstand any variations in contrast s n orf3a orf8 and orf1ab exhibits mutations an intriguing feature for n protein that we noticed here was that both substitutions r203k and g204r were present simultaneously in 26 of the 28 samples with only the 2 remaining samples lacking the g to r changes at the 204th residue mutations in orf8 showed a major substitution l84s and an accompanied substitution of v62l with few isolates with s24l substitution moreover all of these changes are not independent with respect to one another which is established from the fact that v62l is also accompanied by a corresponding substitutions s84l two major amino acid substitutions d75e and p971l of orf1ab occurred in the same eighteen strains that harboured both of these mutations and with no instance of any other strain having mutated at only one of these positions these implicate that these two positions may have a linked relationship and may have some critical functions likewise another clear-cut division of two variants was observed at the 4715th position which possessed l and p variants we can discern a possible link between this mutation and the one discussed at the 265th position both of which explicitly divided the isolates into two groups additionally we also detected two mutations at 5828th l to p and 5865th c to y positions and those strains that contained any one of these variants was also forced to accommodate the other variation with no exception to this event being observed in any sample combined analysis only with the frequently mutated residues identified at least 20 possible variants among which 17 variants occurred at least more than one among the samples considered in this study frequent occurrences of some of the specific combinations of mutations at 5 genes indicated their direct or indirect interaction leading to stability adaptability viability and transmission efficiency of the virus less frequently occurred variants might have eventually lost due to their low transmission efficiency or less adaptability in nature country specific under- andor over-sampling could be a confounding factor for this variation however our observation with 660 samples showed excellent concordance with the data generated from 10000 samples suggesting the generality of this observation the contribution of mutations to the stability and function of the gene product which depends on its location including interaction with other viral or host molecules may determine the viability of the mutant absence of any charge reversal either among sars-cov-2 mutants or other coronaviruses and low frequency of mutations with a change in charge state underscore that it plays an important role in the viability of variants the high viability of d614g mutant of s-protein seemed to be attributable to miniscule changes in partitioning energy as well as the exposed aspartate side chain located on a flexible loop in a relatively hydrophobic environment was not involved in any h-boding while its substitution by glycine could facilitate the movement of the hinge compensatory effects of additional h-bond could be a plausible explanation for the relatively high frequency of l84s orf8 and q57h orf3 mutants however these simple parameters could not explain low abundance of v483a s-protein v62l orf8 v5550l and d75e orf1ab r203k n or discrepancies in an abundance of l3606f vs f6158l and pl mutants at 4715 and 5528 vs 971 positions of orf1ab unlike d614a v483a mutant is a part of the crucial receptor binding domain the tighter binding 410-fold compared to sars-cov-1 of the s1-ctd to hace2 receptor wrapp et al 2020 wang et al 2020c has been attributed to the enhanced infectiousness of sars-cov-2 thus low frequencies of the v483a as well as other s1-ctd mutants seem attributable to their role in interaction with the host receptor it is possible that v62 orf8 r203 n v5550 d75 p971 l3606 and f6158 orf1ab positions are also associated with crucial functional roles beyond stability two variants with co-occurring mutants were more prevalent than the wild type variant the most prevalent variant showed co-occurrence of p5828l and y5865c in orf1ab the ability of proline to introduce kink in the structure - often in turns and loops close to surfaces and the tendency of the upstream cysteine to be modified if exposed or form ss bond if buried may explain the co-occurrence the next prevalent variant showed a co-occurrence of t265i and p4715l in orf1ab this might be indicative of these hydrophobic substitutions coming closer in the tertiary structure and stabilizing it through van der waals interaction the co-occurrence of these orf1ab mutants with d614g s-protein and q57h orf3a is suggestive of functional interaction among these proteins however these interpretations are contingent upon the reported mutation frequencies being representative of the actual variant distribution and certainly begs more investigation and analysis among the structural proteins which were mostly conserved only the spike protein showed several mutations including a dominant mutational variant at the 614th position we have investigated the thermodynamic stability of the variants to identify the variants which are correlated with greater stability and sustainability those strains that corresponded to structures with low stabilities were consequently found to have low transmission capabilities as verified in the nextstrain data we have identified several mutants with stable structures including mutations at positions 49 50 54 614 and 936 and have verified that these variants are enduring among the general population over time with d614g be the most viable among them although some of the mutated residues of spike protein showed a greater reduction of total free energy compared to d614g substitution their spatio-temporal distribution and number of isolates are comparatively lower than the substitution at 614 it clearly suggests that spike protein alone is not the determining factor of the stability adaptability and transmission efficiency of the virus the specific combination of all frequently mutated variants might be necessary for the prediction of the viability of the viral variants however considering only the disparity in the effectiveness of transmission among the different spike protein variants we have two important suggestions to the different nations in tackling and curbing the spread of covid-19 with greater efficacy first and foremost the mutational profile of a patient found to be covid-19 positive needs to be analysed specifically at these key sites of five proteins either by sanger sequencing or designing probes corresponding to these regions thereafter a model can be predicted using the patients severity and transmission of infection among the contacts for each combination of frequently mutated residues though one could argue that as the sequencing of the viral genome had been carried out at different time-points in different countries with some countries like china imposing higher levels of quarantine measures at an earlier time compared to other countries cyranoski 2020 our interpretations may not have 100 accuracy however our hypothesis and interpretation of the mutations show good concordance as evidenced by the nextstrain data further research on the identification of mutational status sars-cov-2 infected individuals and determination of infection among their contacts might help to substantiate the idea of the correlation between genotypes with survivability and transmission of different strains in conclusion we maintain the belief that the propositions voiced here if followed adequately can work to curb the spread of the disease with much higher success the following are the supplementary data related to this article



 there is no conflict of interest in this manuscript  binding ability prediction between spike protein and human ace2 reveals the adaptive strategy of sars-cov-2 in humans xia xue jianxiang shi hongen xu yaping qin zengguang yang shuaisheng feng danhua liu liguo jian linlin hua yaohe wang qi zhang xueyong huang xiaoju zhang xinxin li chunguang chen jiancheng guo wenxue tang jianbo liu  sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of covid-19 globally in the past six months a relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of sasr-cov-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently we particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain rbd of spike protein in sars-cov-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans thus here we collected 2142 highquality genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ace2 hace2 phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show sars-cov-2 is highly possible originated from bat-cov ratg13 found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of pangolin-cov to imbue it the ability to infect humans moreover compared to the s gene of sars-cov-2 it is more conserved in the directbinding sites of rbd and we noticed that spike protein of sars-cov-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better 3860 amino acid mutations in spike protein rbd t333-c525 of sars-cov-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hace2 s19-d615 were calculated our analysis indicates sars-cov-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference and a higher divergence in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of sars-cov-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings  coronavirus is commonly found in nature and infects only mammals and birds 1-3  among 46 species only seven of them are human-susceptible 4 5  aside from sars-cov and mers-cov that cause deadly pneumonia in humans by crossing the species barrier 367  sars-cov-2 is now bringing a global pandemic of respiratory disease within six months after the first case has been confirmed in wuhan city of china 8  it has been identified as a novel coronavirus that is a member of -coronavirus in the family coronaviridae which is a positive single-stranded rna virus with a protein envelope 2  up to date covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 results in more than six million people infected and over 380 thousand deaths worldwide compared with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 spreads more rapidly and being highly infectious to humans 8 9 10  it is crucial to understand the origin of this coronavirus and its strategy in adapting to human hosts so efficiently moreover to apply this knowledge for controlling this pandemic and developing effective therapeutics and vaccines against covid-19 by reconstructing phylogenomic relationships among various coronavirus 11  it showed around 70 genome sequence similarity with sars-cov 11  and more closely related to bat coronavirus ratg13 in the spike s gene 1  given closely related to sars-like coronaviruses the genome structure of sars-cov-2 is similar to other beta-coronaviruses which composed in order with 5replicase orf1ab-s-envelopee-membranem-n-3 with numbers of open reading frames orfs function resembles those of sars-cov 12  it is noted that ratg13 is highly similar to sars-cov-2 especially between genes while they differed in some crucial genomic structures one of the most notable features is that a polybasic furin cleavage site insertion prra residue at the junction between two subunits s1 s2 of s protein 1 2 12 13  although some studies show bats could be the reservoir host for many coronaviruses including sars-cov the reservoir host of sars-cov-2 remains unclear 4 10 14  given the global spread of this epidemic it draws a lot of attention to reveal the origins of the pandemic event the evolutionary of sars-cov-2 may explain its infectiousness and transmissibility among different animal hosts and provide evidence about whether this virus is natural or artificial spike glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov-2 is the key to enter the target cells which forms homotrimers protruding from the surface to recognize host cell receptor and cause membrane fusion 15  spike protein contains s1 and s2 subunits and the receptor-binding domain rbd exists on s1 which can bind to the peptidase domain pd of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 while s2 is responsible for membrane fusion during viral infection 14 16  in sars-cov rbd in spike protein is the most diverse part of the whole genome of which six amino acid y442 l472 n479 d480 t487 and y4911 have been found to play a key role in binding to ace2 receptor and further in transmissibility across species boundary 16  similar to sars-cov rbd mutations acquired during adaption to different host cells along transmission have also been observed in sars-cov-2 thus dissection of the key mutations in spike protein rbd that affect binding to the ace2 receptor would be important for understanding the molecular mechanism of how sars-cov-2 infect human cells recent studies show the ace2 receptor in host cells would mediate the entry ability of sars-cov-2 by interacting with spike protein and its binding capacity to spike protein of sars-cov-2 determines the transmissibility of this coronavirus across species particularly among humans 14 17  the present study intends to 1 reveal the phylogenetic relationship of sars-cov-2 identified in the different population at the genomic level and provide genetic evidence based on the structural protein-coding genes s m n e for identifying the nucleotide variations of sars-cov-2 collected from different regions amid covid-19 pandemic 2 provide a prediction for revealing the adaptive mutations on spike protein of sars-cov-2 based on the specific variation of s gene and finding the differences of stability of spike protein mutants and their affinities with the human ace2 receptors 3 explore whether there are variants of ace2 in different populations which may affect the infectivity of covid-19 to this end we analyzed the variants of ace2 in a large cohort including 1000 chinese local people and other human populations and identified polymorphisms that may influent on the binding between ace2 and spike protein of coronaviruses furthermore we predicted the affinities of spike protein to binding ace2 variants to understand whether those changes would render individuals resistant or susceptible to sars-cov-2 at the molecular level herein our study could explain part of the origin of sars-cov-2 at a phylogenetic level based both on whole genome and multiple key genes to allow the elucidation of population risk profiles and also help advance therapeutics such as a rationally designed soluble ace2 receptor for the management of covid-19 was carried out by kimura two factor correction method for nucleic acid level calculation to avoid the prediction error caused by the selection of outgroups with a far evolutionary relationship the complex outgroup was adopted in this study and the sequence of mers-cov and sars-cov were selected as outgroups to predict the genetic relationship  the maximum likelihood ml phylogenic trees were constructed based on 2147 genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov and mers-cov were selected as the out-groups  figure 1  after alignment we merged identical sequences into one clade with labels kept as one the genomic tree showed all sars-cov-2 was closely related to the sars-like virus found in the horseshoe bat from yunnan ratg13 and a coronavirus from pangolin collected in guangdong province was the sister taxon with ratg13 which is closer to the virus from bat than to other pangolins from guangxi sars-cov-2 is not related closely with sars-cov at the nucleic level australia european countries and usa and the case document showed this patient was confirmed after his seven-day trip to italy and he didnt show any symptoms before his journey some branches were poorly supported by the bootstrap values and exhibited polytomies which indicated sars-cov-2 was adapting the human hosts globally and it is hard to determine the origin of sars-cov-2 solely based on nucleic data furthermore same to the genomic tree multiple genes sequences of sars-cov-2 are divergent from outgroups and we detected some mutations according to s gene sequences comparison  figure 3  as shown in figure 3  we extracted and aligned the s gene sequences from sars coronavirus in different hosts the one from pangolin that closer to sars-cov-2 and ratg13 was from a horseshoe bat rhinolophus spp and we found no big fragment shift in s genes of pangolin and it was less similar to s in sars-cov-2 compared with ratg13 but the insertions exhibited in pangolin indicated potential recombination in spike protein of coronavirus would occur during its cross-species hosts manumission according to s gene sequences in different strains we found the similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-bat 98 is higher than it compared with coronavirus from pangolins 85 it showed more solved of the phylogenetic tree based on s gene fig 4 compared to the trees based on genomic sequences and multiple genes nevertheless the phylogeny reconstructed based on genome s gene and multiple genes all indicate the sars-cov-2 is closely related to ratg13 and the virus isolated from pangolin s gene has been studied as the key gene for sars-cov-2 binding to host cells receptor and this gene shows less conserved compared to the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 and some studies suggest that the high divergence found in spike protein rbd and specifically the direct bonding sites to ace2 receptor play an important role to sars-cov-2 adapting to different animal hosts or the populations in different regions combined with the phylogeny based on the s gene we also detected all mutationson the s gene and their binding capacity with ace2 receptor in human beings 23 point mutations were predicted to significantly influence the affinity and stability of the spike protein fig 5  among which 9 polymorphisms exhibited increased affinity and stability while 14 ones showed decreased affinity and stability table 1  all analysis outcomes of over 3000 polymorphisms in spike protein were shown in supplementary table 1 figure 5 and table 1 showed the missense mutation in spike protein rbd that has significant changes cutoff 3 of the affinity and stability with ace2 receptors interestingly residues l455 q498 and n501 would have two potential mutations that leading to contrary affinities including increased affinity in leucine changed to methionine on aa455 glutaurine changed to tryptophan on aa498 and asparagine changed to tyrosine on aa501 reduced affinity in leucine changed to alanine glutamine changed to alanine asparagine changed to glycine the polymorphisms on the same residue causing two opposite effects of affinity suggested that mutations on those positions may lead to different adaptation directions on sars-cov-2 to fit in different hosts furthermore phe456 gln493 and phe486 showed two mutations that both result in affinity reduction the stability of spike protein with different mutations was showed in table 1  we found only 5 mutants increased the stability of spike protein including g446w g496a q498w n501y and g502y which is not consistent with the affinity to match the mutations of spike protein that reported by sars-cov-2 database of china national center for bioinformation httpsbigdbigaccnncov with our predictions a total of 1150 polymorphisms in spike protein were collected from the database and 643 missense variants were selected and run analysis about their affinity and stability binding to ace2 supplementary table   2  we focused on 76 missense variants in region t333-c525 of spike protein and 9 variants bring significant changes on the affinity of it to ace2  figure 6a  moreover 13 variants cause structural stability changes in spike protein rbd  figure 6b  we calculated the population frequency of 388 missense variants in ace2 collected from gnomad supplementary table 3  and the local population  table 2  analysis of their stability and affinity to spike protein of sars-cov-2 were performed in this study and the results showed no significant differences in both affinity and stability revealing the evolutionary origin of sars-cov-2 is of great value to understand its transmission pathway cross-species and provide a guide to long-term infection prevention of zoonotic coronavirus since it is a novel coronavirus the extremely limited morphological information of sars-cov-2 could be used in the phylogenic analysis genomic data of sars-cov-2 nowadays provide a helpful approach to identify its divergence along with the transmission among  to most sars-coronavirus 5 17  and the s gene is more divergent in coronavirus at a genetic level relative to other genes 14  along adapting to the human host cellular environment mutations occur in spike protein in some of which enable to enhance the binding affinity and stability of spike protein-hace2 complex and the enhancement would increase the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 among human and bring more severe disease 16 table 1  23 variants of spike protein rbd that causing significantly higher or lower affinity to ace2 and stability were focused in this study the cutoff we set up was three for determining significance table 1  among 9 of the mutations that highly enhance the binding between spike protein and ace2 the residue g446 figure 7  was also reported cdc up to date combined 1150 variants 634 missense mutations in total in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 reported by cdc we found their affinity and stability in our analysis outcomes among 76 missense variants that locate in the region between t333-c525 five variants in spike protein enhance its affinity binding to hace2 table 3  and only three of them increase the stability of spike-hace2 complex table 4  additionally we collected the genome sequences of sars-cov-2 that harbor those variants in spike protein and found the variants v483a occurs in 26 strains from the usa v367f occurs in 12 strains from hong kong australia and other european countries and a variant g446v that highly enhance the affinity were identified in a strain from australia supplementary table 2  we mapped those strains onto our genomic phylogenetic tree and found they were dispersed distributed in the position close to the sars-bat and sars-pangolin as covid-19 widespread globally several studies tried to find where this novel coronavirus came from but few reports analyze the origin of sars-cov-2 according to the divergent pattern in spike protein in our study the multiple variants in spike protein found in different countries and clustered in the ancestral direction on phylogeny which might suggest sars-cov-2 infection start to occur at multiple sites but not only in wuhan city however due to the limited detection capability and restricted availability of samples from infected animals the variants available in the national database are uncompleted more data needs to be collected for further studies furthermore since the sars-cov-2 strains have variants on spike protein relative to a reference sequence of sars-cov-2 nc0455122 were found more divergence on the phylogenetic position that closer to sars-bat and sars-pangolin it might indicate a consensus evolution occurred in s gene and enable sars-cov-2 to adapt to human hosts well however since it is difficult to determine the exact time the zero patient who got infected by sars-cov-2 the date of the sample collection and data extracted could mislead the results we believe further clinical information from all the countries would be needed for research and this is a global concern that requires more cooperation and collaboration but not political games or constant blames we shared all the analysis of over 3000 variants on spike protein in this study to help the world tracking the mutations of sars-cov-2 and also can be useful to select the potential druggable targets and neutral inhibitors to prevent the further damages may be brought by the pandemic of covid-19 aside from mutations in spike protein for adapting to new hosts the hace2 also represents polymorphisms in the binding region host-virus interaction over time makes a natural selection on both virus and host cells 30  therefore the variants in hace2 receptor would also play a role in sars-cov-2 infection cao and his colleagues 2020 31 researchers found three unique variants in hace2 in the italian population that might be corresponding to the high fatality including p389h w69c and l351v 33  we compared the unique variants found in local and italian population by mapping them on the hace protein structure  figure 8  and found the italian ones were closer to the binding region than local ones but in silico simulation indicated that none of them change the affinity and stability of spike protein of sars-cov-2 and hace2 complex table 2  generally we did not find any variants in ace2 that would significantly increase or decrease the affinity and stability of spike the ml phylogeny tree of different strains sars-cov-2 from various region all around the world partial the

sars-cov-2 methods and implications author statement changchuan yin  the emerging global infectious covid-19 disease by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late december 2019 in china the virus has gone through various pathways of evolution to understand the evolution and transmission of sars-cov-2 genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance this study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping sars-cov-2 viruses using complete genomes the method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the sars-cov-2 reference genome the single-nucleotide polymorphism snp genotypes are then measured by jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates the genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic the proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations the genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the s proteins and rna polymerase rna primase and nucleoprotein undergo frequent mutations these mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control the novel coronavirus in humans first discovered in wuhan china in december 2019 was initially named as 2019-ncov and then designated as sars-cov-2 due to its taxonomic and genomic relationships with the species severe acute

disease and thousands of deaths worldwide 3 sars-cov-2 coronavirus harbors a linear single-stranded positive rna genome the coronavirus sars-cov-2 genome consists of a leader sequence orf1ab that encodes proteins for rna replication and genes for non-structural proteins nsp and structural proteins the genomic leader sequence of about 265 bp is the unique characteristic in coronavirus replication and plays critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its discontinuous sub-genomic replication 4 orf1ab encodes replicase polyproteins required for viral rna replication and transcription 5 expression of the c-proximal portion of orf1ab requires -1 ribosomal frame-shifting the first non-structural protein nsp encoded by orf1ab is papain-like proteinase pl proteinase nps3 nsp3 is an essential and the largest component of the replication and transcription complex the pl proteinase cleaves non-structural proteins 1-3 and blocks the hosts innate immune response promoting cytokine expression 6 7 nsp4 encoded in orf1ab is responsible for forming double-membrane vesicle dmv the other non-structural proteins are 3clpro protease 3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase 3clpro and nsp6 3clpro protease is essential for rna replication the 3clpro proteinase is accountable for processing the c-terminus of nsp4 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f uk unites states us and

ancestors and relative relationships of each snp genotype from the jaccard distances algorithm 1 snp genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 the genomic analytics is performed using computer programs in python and biopython libraries 33  the gisaid ids of sars-cov-2 isolates are listed in the supplementary material the snp profiles of sars-cov-2 are available upon request results this study retrieved the snp genotypes of 558 sars-cov-2 strains in gisaid database from the globe to investigate the snp distributions among all the virus isolates the snp profiles of all the virus isolates from the globe are visualized and compared for the frequency of each snp mutation in the virus sets the results show large mutation diversity in these virus isolates in the mutation frequency analysis the mutations are due to the fact that rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of rna viruses lacks proofreading however the mutations are not equally distributed the snp mutations can be a single mutation and multiple mutations at a few fixed positions the impacts and roles that these snp mutations have on the pathogenicity and transmission ability of sars-cov remain to be determined by biochemical experiments these divers mutations might impact both transmissibility and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre-proof nucleoprotein therefore these high-frequency snp

primer-dependent non-structural protein 12 nsp12  and the second rna polymerase is nsp8 in contrast to nsp12 nsp8 has the primase capacity for de novo replication initiation without primers 12  nsp7 and nsp8 are important in the replication and transcription of sars-cov-2 the sars-coronavirus nsp7-nsp8 complex is a multimeric rna polymerase for both de novo initiation and primer extension 13 12  nsp8 also interacts with orf6 accessory protein the nsp9 replicase protein of sars-coronavirus binds rna and interacts with nsp8 for its functions 14  furthermore the sars-cov-2 genome encodes four structural proteins the structural proteins possess much higher immunogenicity for t cell responses than the non-structural proteins 15  the structural proteins are involved in various viral processes including virus particle formation the structural proteins include spike s envelope e membrane protein m and nucleoprotein n which are common to all coronaviruses 16 17  the spike s protein is a glycoprotein which has two domains s1 and s2 spike protein s1 attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor ace2 initiating the infection 18 19  after the internalization of the virus into the endosomes of the host cells the s glycoprotein is induced by conformation changes the s protein is then cleaved by cathepsin ctsl and the unmasks the fusion peptide of s2 therefore activating membranes fusion within endosomes  total 558 complete genome sequences of the sars-cov-2 strains from the infected individuals are retrieved from the gisaid database 26 as  the snp mutations including nucleotide changes and the corresponding positions in a genome are called an snp profile the snp profiles of sars-cov-2 isolates are retrieved and parsed from the aligned genomes according to the reference genome sars-cov-2 the snp profile of the complete genome of a virus can be considered as the genotype of the virus the jaccard similarity coefficient    j a b of two sets a and b is defined as the intersectio n size of the two sets divided by the union size of two sets equation 1 29  the jaccard distance is a metric on the collection of finite sets the jaccard distance of two sets a and b is scored as the difference between 100 and the jaccard similarity coefficient equation 2 the genetic relationship of two virus isolates which are represented by the snp sets a and b within the two virus genomes respectively can be inferred by the jaccard distance of the snp sets a and b the jaccard distance of snp variants was adopted in the phylogenetic analysis of human or bacterial genomes 30 31 32  in this study we use the jaccard distance of the snp mutations of sars-cov-2 genomes to measure the dissimilarity of virus isolates journal pre-proof 3 is negative in all the descendants of an snp a  the closest descendant is the one having the minimum and ba   then the two viruses are relatives sharing common snp mutations if two snp sets are ne ither descendant-ancestor nor relatives the corresponding two viruses are isolated mutants hence the relevance of virus isolates can be identified from the directed jaccard measure on the snp genotypes though the source of sars-cov-2 varies we still consider the virus samples were randomly collected for sequencing if a virus strain among all sequenced viruses has many descendants in the genome set this strain is conferred with high transmissibility therefore the snp mutations in this strain are critical for increased transmissibility the directed jaccard distances of the snp mutations are used to identify the relationships of virus strains therefore the genotyping method may determine the virus transmission pattern the pipeline for snp genotyping and analysis is described in algorithm 1 combined these four co-mutations probably can confer increased transmissibility of the virus sars-coronavirus rna replication is unique involving two rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrp the first rna polymerase is a primer-dependent non-structural protein 12 nsp12 whereas the second rna polymerase is nsp8 nsp8 has the primase capacity for de novo initiation rna replication without primers 12  the most abundant snp mutation in sars-cov-2 isolates is 28144tc in nsp8 protein in which amino acid leucine l is mutated to serine s our result is consistent with a previous study on 103 sars-cov-2 genomes in which sars-cov-2 virus is classified as s and l types by the two co-mutations 8782ct and 28144tc 34  the third abundant snp mutation is 26144gt in nonstructural protein 3 nsp3 g251v the protein nsp3 works with nsp4 and nsp6 to induce double-membrane vesicles dmv membrane complex that acts as a platform for rna replication and assembly 11  the most significant snp mutation 23403ag is located in the gene encoding spike glycoprotein s protein d614g the s protein in the sars-cov-2 virus is an important determinant of the host range and pathogenicity the s protein attaches the virion to the cell membrane by binding the host ace2 receptor 35  the mutation d614g is located in the putative s1-s2 junction region near the furin recognition site r667 for the cleavage of s protein when the viron enters or exists cells 36  however the actual functional impact of this high-frequency snp especially the snp analytics result also shows that the primer independent rna primase nsp8 contains more mutations than any other proteins 28144tc 28881ga 28882ga and 28883gc the rna polymerase and primase mutations may confer resistance to mutagenic nucleotide analogs via increased fidelity the previous study indicated that a single mutation in rna polymerase can improve the replication fidelity in rna virus 37  if a mutation is lethal or reduces the transmission ability the mutations may not be carried on or get deceased the snp profiles demonstrate that the mutations in the envelope glycoprotein and rna polymerases predominate only these mutations in the s protein that have strongly binding capacity to cell ace2 receptors while escaping from immune system response can have chances to survive therefore these critical mutations are the results of natural selection in virus evolution in the sars-cov-2 strains found in the us the nucleocapsid n protein gene has three mutations 28881ga 28882ga and 28883gc the n protein of sars-cov is responsible for the formation of the helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly the n protein may cause an immune response and has potential value in vaccine development 38  these mutations shall be considered when developing a vaccine using the n protein  to spread a pathogen virus must multiply within the host to ensure transmission while simultaneously avoiding host morbidity or death therefore during the evolution of a virus the transmissibility of the virus is usually increased whereas the pathogenicity becomes reduced 39  from the snp profiles of sars-cov-2 strain high-frequency mutations predominate in the virus isolations therefore these high-frequency mutations probably contribute to increased transmissibility in addition these high-frequency mutations are associated with different critical proteins this study analyzes and traces the snp profiles from 558 sars-cov-2 strains which have at least 10 descendants the result suggests a number of high-frequency mutations that are associated with different critical proteins the results show that the snp distribution is not random but is predominated at some positions and then have more descendants these high-frequency mutations may confer a high transmissibility of the virus table 2  if we exclude the leader sequence mutation and the synonymous mutations 3037ct 8782ct 18060ct we classify the snp mutations into four major groups based on the impacted proteins 1 single mutation in nsp6 11083gt fig2  2 single mutation in orf3a 26144gt fig3 in rna polymerase nsp8 8782ct 28144tc fig4  and 4 double mutations in s-protein and rna polymerase 241ct 3037ct 14408ct 23403ag  fig5  these strains in one group are derived from the same ancestor stain in that group according to their snp profiles  this study employs the substitutions variants in genotyping for understanding the evolution and transmission of sars-cov-2 however structural variants including insertions deletions and copy number variation are critical for virus pathogenicity 40 and human pathology 41 42    the tandem or dispersed repeats of copy number variants have not been observed in the sars-cov-2 genomes whether these structural mutations can spread is unknown given the limited genome data the phenotype changes of these structural variants need further investigation the proposed genotyping method can reveal the snps patterns and structural variants of virus isolates during evolution the method may also be applied to unravel the evolutionary genetics of zoonotic jumps so that infectious diseases can be prevented identification and comparison of the snps in the spike protein genes of sars-cov-2 and bat-covs using the reference genome of a putative ancestral bat-cov for example pangolins-cov will provide insights on the genetic mechanisms in the zoonotic jump of sars-cov-2 a few notable limitations in this study due to the nature of the genome data shall be noted because the sample collection dates may not reflect the actual infection date so the transmission path analysis is only an approximation caution should be exercised on the genotyping analytics because some countries have not sequenced enough virus samples the frequencies of the genotype j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f groups may be unbalanced due to the unavailability of complete genomes in some countries and regions whether any of these common snp mutations will result in biological and clinical differences remains to be determined in this study the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 are used for snp genotype calling however in times of crisis complete genomes may not be available for snp genotyping in this case the snp variant calling process may directly use the raw ngs reads 32  the snp variants then can be obtained by mapping the ngs reads to the reference genome by bwa alignments 43  followed by gatk variant calling 44  the sars-cov-2 pandemic has caused a substantial health emergency and economic stress in the   reply to snchez-pacheco et al chookajorn and mavian et al explaining phylogenetic network analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes peter forster lucy forster colin renfrew michael forster   the letter by snchez-pacheco et al 4 consists of a number of unsubstantiated statements with regard to coronavirus evolutionary analysis and of methodological misunderstandings as follows snchez-pacheco et al 4 opine that a network does not reflect the important biological features thought to underlie viral evolution such as recombination and horizontal gene transfer making median-joining networks inappropriate in this setting however neither snchez-pacheco et al nor we in our pnas paper 1 claim that recombination in the human coronavirus data has happened it is therefore not clear why snchez-pacheco et al raise this point in fact if recombination had happened frequently then the data would be expected to contain extensive character conflicts which in turn would generate a network with extensive reticulations and hypercubes making the network method a useful diagnostic tool for such events snchez-pacheco et al 4 consider that the cycles present in a median-joining network provide no information about the evolutionary history of the sequences because of the absence of direction however we contend that the inherent advantage of a network over any single tree is to display unresolved data conflicts as cycles reticulations allowing the visualization in this case of 288 most parsimonious coronavirus trees at one glance figure 1 in ref 1 snchez-pacheco et al 4 state that phylogenies do not directly trace transmission history this is clearly true as a general point but evidently not true with respect to the rapidly mutating coronavirus genome the virus mutates faster than one mutation per month which is a short time relative to the serial interval of 4 to 8 d in sars-cov-2 infection chains 5 it therefore makes sense that the network mutations closely reflect infection pathways as we have shown in our published casework snchez-pacheco et al 4 report that the implication that median-joining networks reflect phylogenetic signal in the traditional sense has previously been challenged in one study we refer to the phylogenetic signal being clearly demonstrated in our published documented case studies as well as in the geographic specificities of each cluster a b and c snchez-pacheco et al 4 have the impression that our outgroup does not root at a but rather a itself is derived from one of two possible ancestral viruses with this rooting however this is a misreading of figure 1 in ref 1 the label a refers to the cluster as defined in the text of our article not to one particular node snchez-pacheco et al 4 erroneously believe that the median-joining software option used for our rooting merely links the outgroup sequence the bat coronavirus to the most similar sequence of the already-produced ingroup network in fact however we did not use this post-network rooting option and make no mention of it in our paper we ran the bat sequence as part of the human dataset the letter by chookajorn 6 praises our network method for its successes in human evolutionary studies chookajorn then goes on to endorse our coronavirus network insofar as our clusters are reproducible in an independent maximum likelihood approach 7 chookajorn in his concluding paragraph then states his concerns that sensational scientific results can influence decision making and he states that any potential misinformation must be promptly addressed presumably he is referring to the use of our article by certain media who have tended in several recent interviews and newspaper articles to interpret our article as evidence for an american origin of the coronavirus we have spoken out against this interpretation of our results so we have no disagreement with chookajorn on this point mavian et al 8 support our observation of geographic clustering but make multiple mistakes starting with the rooting of the coronavirus phylogeny they declare that the sequence identity between sars-cov-2 and the bat virus is only 962 implying that these viral genomes which are nearly 30000 nucleotides long differ by more than 1000 mutations in their view such a distant outgroup is unlikely to provide a reliable root for the network we argue on the contrary that the bat virus is surprisingly conclusive as shown by its stable rooting in cluster a despite incrementally increasing the epsilon fuzziness setting in the median-joining network algorithm as described in pnas 1 where mavian et al 8 have gone wrong is to look no further than the 38 difference between bat and human coronavirus differences however if they had considered that the bat virus genome is 30000 nucleotides long and then had looked at the 1200 nucleotide differences between bat and human virus they would have seen that only 19 nucleotides are shared polymorphisms between the bat coronavirus and the consensus of the 160 human coronavirus genomes encompassing maximum parsimony trees of 212 mutations on this basis the bat coronavirus is an excellent outgroup for rooting the network furthermore since publication we have confirmed the bat coronavirus rooting with two strains of the more distant pangolin coronavirus mavian et al 8 are puzzled why the branch to the bat virus in figure 1 of ref 1 is only 16 or 17 mutations in length the answer is that we had stripped all private polymorphisms from the bat coronavirus before running it as an outgroup mavian et al 8 refer to si appendix figure s4 in ref 1 and contend that the network seems to be misrooted because a virus from wuhan from week 0 december 24 2019 is portrayed as a descendant of a clade of viruses collected in weeks 1 through 9 however this assumption that the oldest sampled isolate in a cohort reflects the ancestral type is a misconception by mavian et al the first isolates collected from patients starting on december 24 do not reflect the root type of the outbreak which started weeks or months earlier the purpose of si appendix figure s4 in ref 1 is to demonstrate the futility of using the sampling date of each patient to reconstruct the virus phylogeny at least in this phase of the outbreak mavian et al 8 then misread our article several times confusing the mutations and amino acid changes distinguishing between a b and c mavian et al 8 reproach us by stating that sars-cov-2 sequences showing some geographical clustering cannot be used as a proof of biological differences unless backed by solid experimental data 6 here again mavian et al have misread our article they reiterate one aspect of our article but phrase it as a reproach the correct reading of our article is that we encourage experimental researchers to consider one of the possible explanations namely a biological effect of the mutations mavian et al 8 state that our findings are based on a nonrepresentative dataset of 160 genomes with no significant correlation between prevalence of confirmed cases and number of sequenced strains per country we respond that our data are based on the first 160 high-quality genomes collected sequenced and uploaded to the international gisaid database in order to shed light on the early development of the coronavirus the early outbreak was centered on china and naturally in this early dataset china is well represented it is not clear which alternative sampling strategies mavian et al have in mind or what their alternative sampling strategy would achieve finally mavian et al 8 caution that no firm conclusion should be drawn on disease transmission routes without evaluating the probability of alternative dissemination routes in general we would agree with this point but here we are dealing with the very first detected infections in several countries in january and february 2020 thus there are no realistic alternatives to be evaluated the first mexican case had traveled to italy and the network shows his viral type descended from an italian viral type the early canadian patient had traveled to wuhan and guangdong and the network shows his type to be descended from a guangdong node the first brazilian patient had traveled to italy and his type is descended from an italian type this clear picture is initially surprising but makes sense from a mutational point of view the virus mutates faster than one mutation per month which is a short time relative to the serial interval of 4 to 8 d in sars-cov-2 infection chains 5 it therefore makes sense that the network mutations closely reflect infection pathways  moderate mutation rate in the sars coronavirus genome and its implications zhongming zhao haipeng li xiaozhuang wu yixi zhong keqin zhang ya-ping zhang eric boerwinkle yun-xin fu   the earliest confirmed case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars occurred in november 2002 in the guangdong province of china toward the end of the epidemic as reported by july 31 2003 there were 8098 recognized cases in 31 countries or regions worldwide and 774 implicated deaths who  due to an unprecedented international effort the sars coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the causal agent in late march 2003 and its first complete genomic sequences were published april 13 2003 12 one month later sars-like coronaviruses were found in palm civets and other animals in guangdong china the first evidence of possible interspecies transmission of the virus 3 the re-emergence of the isolated sars cases in asia in december 2003 and in anhui province and beijing china in late april 2004 has confirmed a wide-spread conjecture that the sars-cov will likely be with humans for years to come this re-emergence of sars cases makes it legitimate to critically re-evaluate the time for the origin of the sars-cov  there are 26 putative coding regions which cover about 98 of the 298-kb sars-cov genome approximately two-thirds of the genome are at the 5 side encoding the nonstructural proteins orf1ab and orf1a and one-third are at the 3 side encoding four structural proteins spike glycoprotein s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n 4 the spike glycoprotein especially its s1 subdomain is responsible for binding to the specific receptor in the target cells 45 rna polymerase and nsp1 genes are two major loci in orf1ab  estimating the mutation rate in rna viruses and retroviruses is critical but also challenging for tracing their rapidly evolving paths the rates estimated from the positive-strand ssrna virus appear to be in a similar range eg 10-3 per site per year from the negative-strand ssrna virus although a direct comparison is not possible because the mutation rates could be estimated from different regions or genes 6-15 the estimated mutation rates in coronavirus which sars-cov phylogenetically links to are moderate to high compared to the others in the category of ssrna viruses for example it was estimated to be 03  06  10-2 per site per year in the infectious bronchitis virus in a previous study 8 however the estimated mutation rate appears to have a wider range in the retrovirus 16-20 more details are presented in the discussion section  how sars-cov evolves has important implications for both strategic planning in the prevention of sars epidemics and development of a vaccine and antibodies the mutation rate is among the most fundamental aspect of sequence evolution if the pathogen evolves slowly there will be a better chance for development of effective long lasting vaccines and successful treatment for patients from a particular geographic region will likely be effective for patients from other areas on the other hand if the pathogen particularly the genes coding for major antigens evolves rapidly an effective strategy to prevent transmission of the sars-cov must be the top-priority and an effective vaccine program may be problematic the purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism in the sars-cov genome and in particular to address the issues of the mutation rate and the time for the emergence of the sars-cov in the human population we reported the estimated mutation rate in the sars-cov using the available complete genomic sequences whose clinical history either is certain or could be inferred  the sources of the genomic sequences used in this study and the methods of estimating mutation rates are presented in the methods section the divergence time was inferred based on the information summarized in figure 1 table 1 shows the mutation rates estimated by three strategies when the first strategy was used to adjust for sequencing errors and potential mutations in the cell culture the mutation rate was estimated to be 080  238  10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year using all the sequences not generated from mainland china and 081  138  10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year using the tor2 and urbani sequences only when the second strategy was used the mutation rate was estimated to be 074  162  10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year which is lower than that from using the first strategy as expected the mutation rate estimated using the third strategy was the lowest 054  157  10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year using the 11 sequences not generated from mainland china and 042  072  10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year using the tor2 and urbani sequences only for all samples the proportion of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site ka was 063  10-3 and the proportion of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ks was 065  10-3 leading to kaks being 097 this ratio was 079 in the nonstructural region and 137 in the structural region in particular the values of kaks were 198 for nsp1 and 085 for s  table 2 shows the rates of nucleotide substitution in the coding regions of sequences the overall rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions were 116  330  10-3 and 167  467  10-3 per site per year respectively the non-synonymous rate was higher in the three genes e m and n suggesting some of those mutations might increase antigenicity although the number of mutations used to calculate these rates was small the mutation rate estimated earlier allowed us to estimate the age of the most recent common ancestor mrca of the sample which should be about the same or more recent than the time for the origin of sars-cov the phylogeny reconstructed by the neighbor-joining method with mid-point rooting or by maximum parsimony is overall consistent with the epidemic additional file 1 all the sequences from mainland china clustered together and separated from the remaining sequences including those clinically related to the index patient a gz01 was distantly separated from other sequences assuming the mrca is the root of the phylogeny the age of the mrca is then the divergence time between gz01 and other sequences using the mutation rates estimated above it is found that the mrca could be alive at a time between march 28 and november 29 2002 strategy 1 between february 22 and october 3 2002 strategy 2 and even earlier strategy 3 the most critical implication of these analyses is that it is entirely plausible that the mrca of the sample could be alive as early as the spring of 2002 some uncertainties in the quality of the sequence data and incomplete information from patient histories are two limiting factors of this study the world-wide race to understand this novel virus has provided an unprecedented set of complete genome sequences of a pathogen in an interval of a few weeks but likely side-effects of this race might be an elevated error rate in the released sequences and generating errors during the analysis among the 129 sequence variations reported 4 many were generated randomly by the algorithms during the alignment of the multiple sequences therefore these should be removed or adjusted the concern above has led us to wait until all the sequences used in this study have been significantly revised by their generators and to manually adjust the multiple-sequence alignment still some errors were unavoidable partly due to the intrinsic error rate of sequencing technology for example among 18 common variations 9 could not be uniquely assigned to the internal branches of the phylogeny this incongruence is likely partially due to sequence errors the existence of sequence errors can also be inferred by examining the ratio of transitional versus transversional changes if nucleotide substitution occurs randomly there are two transversional substitutions on average for each transitional substitution and the ratio of transition to transversion should be 05 however transition is generally favored over transversion in many organisms for example the ratio is approximately 2 in the human genome 2122 the ratio has not been discussed extensively in the rna viruses however it appears to be higher than that in the mammalian genomes based on the two previous reports of 37 in the influenza a virus 23 and 50 in the marburg virus 24 in this study 60 transitional substitutions and 54 transversional substitutions were observed among the 16 sequences thus the ratio was 11 the ratio in five sequences from mainland china was 09 considerably smaller than 22 which was observed in the other eleven sequences this suggests that sequences from mainland china may be more erroneous than the other sequences on the other hand the ratio was 09 for the singleton variations which was much lower than the ratio of 35 for the non-singleton variants this further indicates that singletons were more problematic because of the unknown level of errors in the sequences a conservative approach to estimating the mutation rate was taken three strategies were used to reduce the effect of sequence errors one being more aggressive than the other two the mutation rates estimated by the first two strategies were quite similar in the third strategy all the variants unique to a given isolate were excluded such a strategy is very conservative because the amount of singletons is expected to be large in a rapid expanding environment see below therefore the mutation rate was placed in the range of 080  238  10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year based on the 11 sequences used this rate along with the rate of synonymous substitutions estimated in this study is close to that recently reported using another approach 25 in comparison to other coronaviruses this rate is lower than that in the mouse hepatitis virus similar to that in the transmissible gastroenteritis virus but higher than that in the infectious bronchitis virus table 3 6-8 the estimated mutation rate is at the same order of magnitude as in other rna viruses for example 23  10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year in the influenza a viruses 1213 the estimated mutation rate in hiv appears to have a wide range 1617 it is likely that the mutation rate in the sars-cov is not higher than that in hiv therefore the sars-cov is not an unusual coronavirus or rna virus in terms of its speed of nucleotide changes one of the challenging tasks therefore is to find those variations which led to the sars-cov being unique from other rna viruses especially coronaviruses and how those variations changed the functionality and helped to transmit it to humans nucleotide variation is distributed along the entire genome based on our alignment and the annotation in genbank 21 of the 26 open reading frames had the variations including genes encoding polymerase spike glycoprotein envelope membrane and nucleocapsid protein the estimated mutation rate suggests that approximately 2 to 6 new mutations will occur each month in a virus assuming the overall uniform mutation rate however the rate of the non-synonymous substitutions might vary during the course of the sars-cov evolution 25 it was observed that there was an excess of mutations and amino acid changes in the external branches of the phylogeny of a large sample of the ha gene sequences of influenza a which was partially caused by sampling bias 26 from a population genetics standpoint a large proportion of mutations should occur in the external branches when the infected hosts have rapidly increased therefore one should not conclude that mutation rate is low because of a relatively small number of mutations in the internal branches 27 our analysis even by a conservative estimation of mutation rate indicates that the sars-cov population has already harbored a considerable amount of genetic diversity the emerging time of the sars-cov is of special importance in dissecting the origin of the virus as well as the dynamics of the epidemic the time for the most recent common ancestor of the 16 isolates was estimated to be between february 2002 and november 2002 although this is consistent with the date for the earliest known case of sars and those estimated in other studies 2528 it also suggests that sars-cov could have been present longer than generally believed that is around november 2002 one possible scenario is that the sars-cov had already infected some people in the spring of 2002 but failed to cause epidemics its spread was however suppressed in the summer similar to the summer of 2003 and re-emerged around november to cause the epidemic in 2003 given the current re-emergence of sars cases this scenario is becoming more likely there were indeed some media reports of sars-like symptoms of patients in the spring of 2002 although none have been convincingly confirmed an alternative scenario is that the common ancestor of the sars-cov lived in the spring of 2002 but the host was animals the recent finding of high sequence homology between the isolate from a newly emerged sars case december 16 2003 and the isolates from the masked palm civets 29 makes civets as the primary suspect of reservoir for sars-cov the estimated mutation rate and the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates in the sars-cov genome were moderate compared to that in coronavirus and other rna viruses suggesting that the sars-cov is not an unusual coronavirus in terms of its speed of nucleotide or amino acid changes based on the mutation rates estimated in this study the emerging time of the most recent common ancestor of the 16 isolates can be placed between february 2002 and november 2002 this suggests that the sars-cov could have been with humans as early as the spring of 2002 without causing a severe epidemic  we obtained 16 complete genomic sequences from the ncbi website  among them five sequences bj01-04 and gz01 were obtained from the hosts collected in mainland china and the remaining sequences tor2 urbani cuhk-w1 cuhk-su10 hku-39849 five singaporean sequences and tw1 were from the hosts in other geographic regions detailed information of the sequences is shown in table 4  clustal x 30 a window-based user interface to the clustal w was used to align the multiple sequences the alignment was further manually examined and adjusted all gene annotation information and nucleotide position designations in this study refer to the tor2 sequence genbank accession id nc004718 to avoid complications only the single nucleotide variations were analyzed and all alignment gaps were excluded this led to the identification of a total of 114 single nucleotide variations among all the sequences and an average of 182 nucleotide differences between two sequences  the mega2 computer program 31 was used to calculate the pair-wise nucleotide differences the resulting genetic distances were corrected by jukes and cantors method 32 the phylogeny of the sample was reconstructed using both neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods 3133 mutation rate can be estimated in principle by the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences divided by twice their divergent time ie the time to their most recent common ancestor due to better documented contact histories mutation rates were estimated only by the sequences whose hosts were not from mainland china that is sequences tor2 urbani cuhk-w1 cuhk-su10 hku-39849 five singaporean sequences and tw1 first the range of the divergence time between each pair of sequences was inferred based on information on infection history reported strain isolation dates and sequence release dates additional file 2 434-36 for example the divergence time between isolates tor2 and urbani was estimated to be in the range of 34 to 58 days 3536 second nucleotide difference between each pair of sequences was calculated with adjustments to reduce the effect of sequencing errors and potential mutations during cell culture three strategies were used the first strategy was used to reduce the number of pair-wise nucleotide differences by the averaged number of nucleotide differences observed in five closely related singaporean sequences 4 this strategy effectively assumes that there is no real nucleotide difference among these five sequences so that their observed differences reflect the level of errors the second strategy was used to reduce the pair-wise nucleotide difference by two and to add 7 days to the divergence time to account for cell culture time this strategy assumes that the mutation rate during the cell culture is the same as that in the human host and that on average the sequencing error is one nucleotide per genome in the third strategy we excluded all the nucleotide variants which had been observed only once singletons among the 61 human sars-cov sequences reported in 25 the rational is that non-singleton mutations observed in a sample are much less likely due to sequencing errors as well as mutations during the laboratory passage of virus this strategy is apparently conservative and can be regarded as the lower bound of the mutation rate finally the mutation rate per site per year was estimated by   where dij is the genetic distance between sequence i and j tij is twice their divergence time in number of days and n is the number of sequences  a mutation in a codon is non-synonymous or non-silent if it changes the amino acid and is synonymous silent otherwise the number of non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous site ka and the number of synonymous mutations per synonymous site ks were computed using the method of li wu and luo 37 the non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were calculated using the divergence time as estimated above only the second strategy was applied to the rate estimation because the number of nucleotide differences used for the adjustment in the first strategy can not be separated for the non-synonymous and synonymous mutations  zz

w kwok chan h kwok yuen y yi guan joseph peiris s m  four clinical isolates of sars coronavirus were serially passaged in two primate cell lines frhk4 and vero e6 viral genetic sequences encoding for structural proteins and open reading frames 6-8 were determined in the original clinical specimen the initial virus isolate passage 0 and at passages 5 10 and 15 after 15 passages a total of 15 different mutations were identified and 12 of them were non-synonymous mutations seven of these mutations were recurrent mutation and all located at the spike membrane and orf 8a protein encoding sequences mutations in the membrane protein and a deletion in orf 6-8 were already observed in passage 0 suggesting these amino acid substitutions are important in the adaptation of the virus isolate in primate cell culture a mutation in the spike gene residue 24079 appeared to be unique to adaptation in frhk4 cells it is important to be aware of cell culture associated mutations when interpreting data on molecular evolution of sars coronavirus  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov is a novel coronavirus which is an outlier of the group 2 coronaviruses in the order of nidovirales  the genome is a 297 kb singlestranded rna and contains five major open reading frames orfs that encode the replicase polyprotein orf 1a and orf 1ab spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins in that order the genomic rna itself is mrna and is responsible for orf 1a and orf 1ab polyprotein expression proteins encoded by the rest of the genome are generated by subgenomic mrna in addition to the structural proteins and the replicase the rna also encodes other proteins with unknown functions marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003  the s e m and n proteins are the structural proteins of the virus the n protein is an internal protein and it binds to viral rna to form the ribonucleoprotein complex huang et al 2004  by contrast s e and m are surface proteins e and m are integral membrane proteins and are the minimal set of proteins required for virus assembly bos et al 1996  s protein is responsible for receptor binding and a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been identified as a key functional receptor of the protein  the receptor-binding domain of the s protein is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537 xiao et al 2003  recently cd209l l-sign is also shown to facilitate sars-cov entry jeffers et al 2004  the natural reservoir of this pathogen is not known but the identification of a related virus in himalayan palm civets and other small mammals suggested that sars-cov may have emerged from a non-primate mammalian species being a virus newly introduced to humans it had several sequence changes that might be associated with adaptation to the human host chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004  in particular sequence analyses of sars-cov isolated from different phases of the outbreak indicated the s gene had the highest mutation rate and that it was adapting to the new host chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004 yeh et al 2004  initial isolation of the sars-cov was made in cells derived from non-human primates peiris et al 2003  we serially passaged four clinical isolates in two primate cell lines and looked for recurrent mutations in their progeny

passaged 15 times in frhk4 or vero e6 cells respectively viral rna from the original clinical sample the initial virus isolate passage 0 passage 5 passage 10 and passage 15 were sequenced orfs for all structural proteins ie s e m and n were examined because previous studies had suggested that deletions in between the m and n genes might be associated with adaptation of the virus to primates thiel et al 2003  the orfs 6-8 ie 27074-28118 nt of tor2 strain was also sequenced fifteen different mutations were identified and these are summarized in table iii  all mutations were confirmed by independent sequencing reactions of these mutations there were three synonymous mutations residues 27995 28161 and 28557 five recurrent nonsynonymous mutations residues 23412 23473 23518 24079 and 26477 and one recurrent deletion residues 27808-27809 three of these 15 mutations residues 24978 26477 and 26600 were also reported by others httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomessarssarsnuc html apart from the mutation at residue 26477 all other point mutations were transition mutations two non-synonymous mutations residues 26477 and 26600 in the m gene and a deletion in the orf 8a were already observed from viruses in passage 0 in subsequent passages viruses grown in both vero e6 and frhk4 cells developed identical mutations at residues 23412 23473 and 23518 of the spike protein gene by contrast a mutation at residue 24079 occurred in all four viruses passaged in frhk4 cells but in none of vero e6 cell passaged viruses in the early phase of the sars outbreak the s protein of the virus was under strong selection pressure and peiris et al 2003  we used four independent viral isolates and serially passaged these viruses in these two cell lines the sequence of the virus in the original clinical specimen was compared with that of the initial isolate and subsequent passages to avoid possible bias generated from clone selection we did not plaque purified the progeny viruses during the passage instead we used supernatants from virus cultures for subsequent infection and for sequencing thus our results represented the dominant viral species in these passages previous studies indicated that the overall mutation rate for sars-cov in cell culture was found to be low vega et al 2004  it was therefore expected that the recurrent mutations identified in this study would not be a random event and might be highly relevant to host adaptation or to tissue tropism we observed a total of 15 different mutations in this study seven point mutations residues 23412 23473 23518 23632 24079 24864 and 24978 were observed in the s gene the m gene was found to contain 2 point mutations residues 26477 and 26600 there was 1 point mutation residue 27995 and 1 deletion residues 27808-27809 in the orf 6-8 region four mutations were identified in the n gene residues 28161 28557 29294 and 29366 by contrast no mutation was observed in the e gene the majority of these mutations were non-synonymous mutations 12 out of 15 suggesting that replication in non-human primate cells imposes a high selection pressure on these viruses this selection pressure was further highlighted by the fact that 7 out of these 12 non-synonymous mutations were recurrent mutations all of these recurrent mutations were located at the s m and orf 8a sequences while a number of these recurrent mutations occurred in both vero e6 and frhk4 cell passaged viruses one mutation residue 24079 appeared unique to frhk4 cell culture three of these recurrent mutations point mutations in residue 26600 and 264777 and a dinucleotide-deletion in residues 27808-27809 were already apparent in the first passage of the virus these results suggest these positions in particular to those mutations found in the early passages might be critical for adaptation of the virus in culture in the s gene seven non-synonymous point mutations were found all of these mutations were located at the ectodomain of the protein fig 1  interestingly none of these mutations were within the receptor binding domain xiao et al 2003  suggesting there is no major selection pressure on this domain as the strains we studied were all isolated from the middle phase of the sars outbreak chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004  it is likely that the receptor-binding site of these isolates was already adapted to primate receptors the mutation at position 24978 has been previously found by direct sequencing of the virus in the original clinical specimens chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004  this result suggests that this particular position is not just a cell culture artifact but is highly relevant in adaptation to primates the recurrent mutations in the s gene ie positions 23412 23473 23518 and 24079 were all located in between the receptor binding and heptad repeat 1 domains mutations at positions 23412 23473 and 23518 were observed in viruses propagated in both vero e6 and frhk4 cells by contrast all viruses passaged in frhk4 viruses had the same mutation at position 24079 none of the vero e6 cell passaged viruses had acquired this mutation as this mutation is located at the putative fusion peptide of the s protein bosch et al 2004  our results suggested this cell type-specific mutation might facilitate fusion and entry of these viruses in frhk4 cells nonetheless further study is required to elucidate the biological significance of these mutations two mutations 26477 gt 26600 ct observed in the m protein encoding sequence in early passages were also found in previously reported genetic sequences from clinical samples or from human isolates the polymorphism at position 26477 could be observed from direct sequencing of viruses from original clinical samples chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004  the polymorphism at position 26600 was also found in some published viral sequences http wwwncbinlmnihgovgenomessarssarsnuchtml however there was insufficient information on cell culture passage history of these viruses to know whether this mutation is a natural sequence variation or a mutation selected by cell culture in vitro interestingly based on the polymorphisms in these two positions all of our clinical isolates and published viral sequences httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomessarssarsnuc html n  111 could be classified into gc tt and tc genotypes by contrast no gt genotype was observed in all available sequences suggesting the virus does not tolerant this genotype in our study both strains a and d in our study have a c to t mutation at position 26600 this mutation converted strain a from a tc to a tt genotype for the strain d an additional g to t mutation at position 26477 was observed these double mutations thereby converting strain d from a gc to a tt phenotype it should be noted that these mutations resulted in changing the amino acid residues in the first and second transmembrane helix domains marra et al 2003  it is therefore tempting to speculate that the amino acids at these positions are important for the toplogy of the protein and that the virus would introduce a complementary mutation in these positions to prevent the generation of a gt genotype further structure studies on this protein are required to prove this hypothesis none of the viruses we studied had mutation in the orf of the e gene suggesting that culture in non-human primate cells does not impose a major selection pressure on the e gene alternatively it is possible that mutations in such a small protein would not be well tolerated by the virus this latter possibility is supported by a previous finding that the e proteins are highly conserved among different strains of mouse hepatitis viruses fischer et al 1998  of the four mutations identified in the n protein encoding sequence two were non-silent mutations these two mutations occurred simultaneously in the same virus strain b at passage 15 whether these mutations are complementary to each other requires further investigation nonetheless no recurrent mutation was found in this gene indicating the gene is not subjected to a high selection pressure when compared to sars-cov found in animals a 29nucleotide nt deletion in the orf 8b was found in most of human sars-cov sequences  subsequent investigations further revealed similar nucleotide deletions in most of human isolates chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004 vega et al 2004  besides thiel et al 2003 had reported the emergence of a 45-nucleotide deletion in the orf 7b following passage in vero e6 cells these findings suggested that a deletion in these regions might be associated with host adaptations we therefore sequenced the orf 6-8 of all our viruses and identified a silent mutation in the orf 8b  table i  all of our original clinical isolates maintained the 29-nt deletion throughout the passages and we did not observe deletion in orfs 6 and 7 however a dinucleotide deletion at nt 27808-27809 in strains a and d was identified this deletion leads to a frame shift mutation in orf 8a the same deletion was found in two published sequences strains twc and whu these published sequences were derived from viruses passaged in vero e6 cells yan et al 2004 yeh et al 2004  it should be noted that apart from the above deletions several other deletions in the orf 8 sequence were detected from other isolates httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomessarssarsnuc html although the function of orf 8a is not clear these observations clearly suggested that orf 8a and its protein were dispensable in cell cultures the identification of sars-like coronavirus in himalayan palm civet and other small mammals suggested human sars-cov might grow in cells from these mam-mals  however attempts in culturing human isolates in primary lung and kidney cells derived from himalayan palm civets were not successful data not shown indicating human sars-cov are not adapted to these primary cells in summary we report several mutations that might relevant to the adaptation of sars-cov to cell cultures of non-human primates of all the sequenced regions recurrent mutations were only identified in the s m and putative orf 8a protein encoding sequences further studies on these regions might advance our understanding of pathogenesis host adaptation and tissue tropism besides our results demonstrated that mutations can be cell type-specific and can occur rapidly during viral passage mutations at these sites in phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses may reflect adaptations in cell culture rather than true changes in the human host therefore mutations identified in virus isolates cultured in vitro should ideally be confirmed by the direct sequencing of original clinical specimens  codon usage and phenotypic divergences of sars-cov-2 genes maddalena dilucca sergio forcelloni alexandros georgakilas g andrea giansanti athanasia pavlopoulou   the name coronavirus is derived from the greek o due to the viruses typical shapes being crown-like the first complete genome of a coronavirus mouse hepatitis virusmhv a positive sense single-stranded rna virus was first reported in 1990 1 it belongs to the family coronaviridae and ranges from 264 thcov hku12 to 317 sw1 kb in genome length 2 having the largest genome among all known rna viruses with g  c contents varying from 32 to 43 3 the orthocoronavirinae sub-family consists of four genera based on their genetic properties alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus subdivided in subgroups a b c and d gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus coronaviruses can infect humans and diverse animal species including swine cattle horses camels cats dogs rodents birds bats rabbits ferrets minks snakes and other wildlife animals in this study we have focused on 30 coronavirus cov genomes 28 viruses from woo et al 2010 4 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which appeared for the first time in 2012 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which just broke out in wuhan china in december of 2019 only seven covs have been identified that infect humans two coronaviruses that cause relatively mild respiratory symptoms have been known of since the 1960s that is human cov-229e hcov-229e and human cov-oc43 hcov-oc43 human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarsr-cov was identified in 2003 and it causes a more severe respiratory syndrome 5 the human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 was first identified in 2004 and it causes respiratory symptoms in humans 6 the fifth member human cov-hku1 hcov-hku1 was described in 2005 7 more recently the pathogenic middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov coronavirus was identified as the sixth human coronavirus 8 finally the present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 is caused by human sars-cov-2 infections 910 the newly sequenced sars-cov-2 genome encodes two open reading frames orfs orf1a and orf1ab the latter encodes replicase polyproteins and four structural proteins 1112 namely the spike-surface glycoprotein protein s the small envelop protein protein e the matrix protein m and the nucleocapsid protein n the phenomenon of codon usage bias cub exists in many genomes including rna genomes and it is actually determined by mutation and selection 131415 the non-random selection of synonymous codons is known to vary among species that are potential hosts for viruses 16 it is therefore important to study patterns of common codon usage in coronaviruses because cub can be related to the driving forces that shape the evolutions of small rna viruses mutational bias has been considered as the major determinant of codon usage variation among rna viruses 17 indeed rna viruses show an effective number of codons enc that is quite high enc  45 pointing to quite random codon usage whereas the adaptive index cai indicates that the viral cub is consistent with that of the host as observed in the equine infectious anemia virus eiav or zaire ebolavirus zebov 18 the aims of this study were to perform a comprehensive analysis of the nucleotide composition codon usage and rate of protein divergence of sars-cov-2 and to thereby draw inferences regarding its leading evolutionary determinants the complete coding genomic sequences of 306 isolates of sars-cov-2 reported across the world to date were obtained from gisaid available at httpswwwgisaidorgepiflu-applicationsnext-hcov-19-app and ncbi viral databases accessed as of 17 march 2020 then the sequences were selected according to their geographical distributions isolation dates and host species in this study we explored 30 cov genomes 28 viruses from woo et al 2010 4 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 we downloaded the coding sequences of these coronaviruses from the national center for biotechnological information ncbi available at httpswwwncbinlmnihgov for each virus we investigated the following genes shown in alphabetical order e m n rdrp and s the diverse nucleotide compositional properties were calculated for the coding sequences of the 30 cov genomes these compositional properties comprise the frequencies of occurrence of each nucleotide a u g and c au and gc contents and nucleotides g  c at the first gc1 second gc2 and third codon positions gc3 to calculate these values we used an in-house python script we calculated also the mean frequencies of nucleotides g  c at first and second positions gc12 rscu vectors for all the genomes were computed by using an in-house python script following the formula1rscuixi1nij1nixj in the rscui xi is the number of occurrences in a given genome of codon i and the sum in the denominator runs over its ni synonymous codons if the rscu value for a codon i is equal to 1 this codon has been chosen equally and randomly codons with rscu values greater than 1 have positive codon usage bias while those with a value less than 1 have relatively negative codon usage bias 19 rscu heat maps were drawn with the cimminer software 20 which uses euclidean distances and the average linkage algorithm enc is an estimate of the frequency of different codons used in a coding sequence in general enc ranges from 20 when each amino acid is coded by the same codon to 61 when all synonymous codons are used on an equal footing given a sequence of interest the computation of enc starts from f a quantity defined for each family  of synonymous codons one for each amino acid2fnkn2

where ns is the number of families with one codon only and km is the number of families with degeneracy m the set of 6 synonymous codons for leu can be split into one family with degeneracy 2 similar to that of phe and one family with degeneracy 4 similar to that eg of pro enc was evaluated by using the implementation in dambe 50 21 the codon adaptation index cai 22 was used to quantify the codon usage similarities between the virus and host coding sequences the principle behind cai is that codon usage in highly expressed genes can reveal the optimal ie most efficient for translation codons for each amino acid hence cai is calculated based on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess for each codon i the relative synonymous codon usages rscui and the relative codon adaptiveness wi4rscuixi1nij1nixjwirscuimaxj1nirscuj in the rscui xi is the number of occurrences of codon i in the genome and the sum in the denominator runs over the ni synonyms of i rscus thus measures codon usage bias within a family of synonymous codons then wi is then defined as the usage frequency of codon i compared to that of the optimal codon for the same amino acid encoded by iie the one which is mostly used in a reference set of highly expressed genes the cai for a given gene g is calculated as the geometric mean of the usage frequencies of codons in that gene normalized to the maximum cai value possible for a gene with the same amino acid composition5caigi1lgwi1lg
where the product runs over the lg codons belonging to that gene except the stop codon this index values range from 0 to 1 where the score 1 represents the tendency of a gene to use the most frequently used synonymous codons in the host the cai analysis of these coding sequences is performed using dambe 50 21 the synonymous codon usage data of different hosts human and other species were retrieved from the codon usage database httpwwwkazusaorjpcodon to study the patterns of codon biases in the coronaviruses we used z-score values6zvencenccovencvvnv
where enccov is the average of the ratio within a codon bias index in a coronavirus v encv and v is the average value of enc and its standard deviation over the whole virus v and nv is the number of viruses we use the standard deviation of the mean when comparing average values the same z-score was evaluated for codon bias index cai the similarity index sid provides a measure of similarity in codon usage between the virus in our case sars-cov-2 and the host under study formally it is defined as follows7rabk159aibik159ai2k159bi2

where ai is the rscu value of 59 synonymous codons of the sars-cov-2 coding sequences bi is the rscu value of the identical codons of the potential host rab is defined as the cosine value of the angle included between a and b spatial vectors and therefore quantifies the degree of similarity between the virus and the host in terms of their codon usage patterns in our analysis we considered the hosts species shown in table 1 by woo et al 4 we also considered snakes and pangolins because they were previously identified as possible candidates for the novel coronavirus spillover into humans 9 sid values range from 0 to 1 specifically the higher the value of sid the more adapted the codon usage of sars-cov-2 to the host 23 enc-plot analysis was performed to estimate the relative contributions of mutational bias and natural selection in shaping cub of genes encoding proteins that are crucial for sars-cov-2 rdrp the spike-surface glycoprotein protein s the small envelop protein protein e the matrix protein m and the nucleocapsid protein n the enc-plot is a plot in which enc is the ordinate and the gc-content in the third codon position gc3 is the abscissa depending on the action of mutational bias and natural selection different cases are discernable if a gene is not subject to selection a clear relationship is expected between enc and gc3 249enc2s29s21s2
where s represents the value of gc3 24 for those genes codon preference determined only by mutational bias is expected to lie on or just below wrights theoretical curve alternatively if a particular gene is subject to selection then it falls below wrights theoretical curve in this case the vertical distance between the point and the theoretical curve provides an estimation of the relative extent to which natural selection and mutational bias affect cub to evaluate the dots scattering from wrights theoretical curve we calculated the module of distance and the box plots were drawn with an in-house python script we performed neutrality plot analysis 25 to estimate the relative contributions of natural selection and mutational bias in shaping the cubs of five crucial coronavirus genes in the research field aiming to develop a vaccine against sars-cov-2 m n s rdrp and e in this analysis the gc1 or gc2 values ordinate were plotted against the gc3 values abscissa and each gene was represented as a single point on this plane in this case the three stop codons uaa uag and uga and the three codons for isoleucine auu auc and aua were excluded from the calculation of gc3 and two single codons for methionine aug and tryptophan ugg were excluded in all three gc1 gc2 and gc3 25 for each gene we separately performed a spearman correlation analysis between gc1 and gc2 with the gc3 if the correlation between gc12 and gc3 is statistically significant the slope of the regression line provides a measure of the relative extent to which natural selection and mutational bias affect the cubs of these genes sueoka 1999 in particular if the mutational bias is the driving force that shapes the cub then the corresponding data points should be distributed along the bisector slope of unity on the other hand if natural selection also affects the codon choice of a family of genes then the corresponding regression line should diverge from the bisector thus the divergence between the regression line and bisector quantifies the extent of codon usage preference due to the natural selection to study the mutational rates of genes m n s rdrp and e we performed an analysis by using our previously defined forsdyke plot 26 each gene in sars-cov-2 used as a reference was compared to its orthologous gene in the 30 coronaviruses considered in this analysis each pair of orthologous genes is represented by a point in the forsdyke plot where protein divergence is correlated with dna divergence see methods in 26 for details the protein sequences were aligned using biopython the dna sequences were then aligned using the protein alignments as templates then both dna and protein divergences were assessed as explained in methods in 26 by counting the number of mismatches in each pair of aligned sequences thus each point in the forsdyke plot measures the divergence between pairs of orthologous genes in the two species as projected along with the phenotypic protein and nucleotidic dna axis the first step in each comparison is to compute the regression line between protein vs dna sequence divergence in the forsdyke plot getting values of intercept and slope for each variant of genes ie m n s rdrp and e to test whether the regression parameters associated with each variant are different or not we followed a protocol founded by dilucca et al considering a p-value  005 to explore the evolutionary relationships among the four genera of coronaviruses phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genomic sequences of the 30 covs listed in table 1 was performed the sequences were aligned with the usage of clustalo 2728 the resulting multiple sequence alignment was used to build a phylogenetic tree by employing a maximum likelihood ml method implemented in the software package mega version 10 1 29 modeltest-ng 30 was used to select the best-fit evolutionary model of nucleotide substitution that is gtr  g  i bootstrap analysis 100 pseudo-replicates was conducted in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the inferred trees we calculated the nucleotide compositions of the coronavirus genomes under study see table 1 previous results showed that the gene n which follows the trend a  u  g  c 12 and the coronavirus rna genomes are biased towards high au content and low gc content 31 in line with that our results show that the nucleotide a is the most frequent base and the nucleotide composition follows the trend a  u  g  c see table 2 interestingly sars-cov-2 has a nucleotide composition that is similar to the other covs but with a different trend u  a  g  c the gc content in sars-cov-2 is 037  005 we downloaded the protein-coding sequences of sars-cov-2 from gisaid database and classified each sars-cov-2 based on the geographic location in which it was sequenced see tree in figure a1 for each sars-cov-2 genome we calculated the relative synonymous codon usage rscu in the form of a 61-component vector the heatmap and the associated clustering of these vectors are shown in figure a2 we noted that the overall codon usage bias among sars-cov-2 strains appears to be similar moreover their associated rscu vectors did not cluster according to geographic location thereby confirming the common origin of these genomes motivated by these observations we considered a unique vector to represent the codon usage of sars-cov-2 in the following analyses we compared the codon usage of sars-cov-2 with that of the other coronavirus genomes for this purpose we used the rscu which is a biologically relevant metric of the distance between the codon usage in the protein-coding sequences of these genomes the heatmap of the rscu values associated with the coronaviruses is shown in figure 1 the rscu values of the majority of the codons scored between 0 and 31 see legend in figure 1 interestingly the newly identified sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 coronavirus clusters with the other two human coronaviruses sarsr-cov and hcov-229e moreover in this heatmap hcov-hku1 and hcov-nl63 cluster together consistent with viral adaptation to their host in line with previous observations we show that the mean cpg relative abundance in the coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed 32 specifically ggg ggc ccg pyrimidine-cpg and acg purine-cpg present low frequencies of occurrence probably due to the relative trna abundance of the host in sars-cov-2 the most frequently used codons are cgu arginine 234 times and ggu glycine 242 whereas the least used codons are ggg glycine and ucg serine of note the most frequently used codons for each amino acid end with either u or a 18 to measure the codon usage bias in the coronavirus genomes we used the effective number of codons enc and the competition adaptation index cai for each coronavirus we calculated the average values of cai and enc associated with its genes in table 3 the enc and cai values for all the coronaviruses considered in this work are reported to visually enhance the differences among the codon usage of these coronaviruses we calculated the z-score value of each virus with respect to the average values of enc and cai calculated for all 30 coronaviruses the human coronaviruses show different patterns of codon usage figure 2 with the exception of hcov-oc43 all the human coronaviruses have enc and cai values that are significantly different from the average values of enc and cai calculated for all 30 coronaviruses z-score  3 specifically the enc value associated with sars-cov-2 519  259 is significantly higher than the average of all coronaviruses 5009  132 indicating that sars-cov-2 uses a broader set of synonymous codons in its coding sequences moreover the cai of sars-cov-2 0727  0054 is markedly higher than the average one 069  0024 underscoring that sars-cov-2 uses codons that are better adapted to its host moreover the cai of sars-cov-2 is significantly higher than the cai of the other human covs in the subfamily thereby suggesting a greater adaptation to the human host for sars-cov-2 compared to the other coronaviruses finally the enc values of the three most pathogenic hcovs having z-scores  3 sars-cov sars-cov-2 and mers are on average higher than the encs of the other four hcovs which have instead z-scores 3 this higher cub in terms of encs of the four hcovs reinforces their strong adaptiveness to humans as they have been circulating in the population for a long time and are now less pathogenic to better clarify the origin of sars-cov-2 and its optimization to the human host we then calculated the average cai for the sars-cov-2 genes by using different reference hosts figure 3 interestingly snake and human hosts correspond to the highest values of cai indicating that sars-cov-2 uses codons that are better optimized to these two organisms although our results suggest a possible origin of sars-cov-2 from snakes and its spillover into humans 33 previous studies do not support this hypothesis 3435 similarly to corroborate this observation we also calculated the similarity index sid of sars-cov-2 for the hosts reported in figure 3 see figure a4 sid values range from 0 to 1 the higher the value of sid the more adapted the codon usage of sars-cov-2 to the host 23 since recent studies have revealed multiple lineages of malayan pangolin manis javanica coronavirus that are similar to sars-cov-2 36 we also added this organism in the present analysis cai was not calculated for pangolin because its genome is not well-annotated and the five genes under investigation m n s e and rdrp are not available sid values range from 023 in rabbit to 078 in human notably this analysis not only confirms our previous observation see figure 3 that sars-cov-2 uses codons that are better optimized to snakes sid  075 and humans sid  078 but reveals the same for pangolins sid  076 bats sid  070  and rats sid  071 which are also possible hosts for sars-cov-2 9 the genome of the newly emerging sars-cov-2 consists of a single positive-stranded rna which is approximately 30000 nucleotides long the newly sequenced sars-cov-2 genome is organized similarly to the other coronavirus genomes ceraolo et al performed a cross-species analysis for all proteins encoded by sars-cov-2 see figure 3 and figure 4 in 37 it encodes polyproteins common to all betacoronaviruses which are further cleaved into the individual structural proteins e m n and s and the non-structural rdrp 38 thus only five viral genes classified according to their viral locations were studied for each virus because the short length and insufficient codon usage diversity of the other genes might have biased our results the corresponding gene products are involved in essential viral functions briefly s protein regulates viral attachment to the receptor of the target host cell 39 e protein functions to assemble the virions and acts as an ion channel 40 m protein plays a role in viral assembly and is involved in the biosynthesis of new virus particles 41 n protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the viral rna 12 rdrp catalyzes viral rna synthesis for these five proteins the rscu vectors in each virus of the dataset are shown in figure 4 and figure a5 we showed that sars-cov-2 clusters with sarsr-cov and sarsr-rh-batcov hku3 only for genes e m and n consistent with the inferred phylogeny shown in figure a3 to further investigate which factors account for the low codon usage bias of the coronavirus genes we analyzed the relationship between the enc value and the percentage of g or c in the third codon position gc3s the enc-plots obtained for the five genes m n s e and rdrp are shown separately together with wrights theoretical curve figure 5 denoting that gc3s is only determined exclusively by codon usage 24 thus if mutational bias as quantified by gc-content in the generally neutral third codon position is the main factor in determining the codon usage among these genes the corresponding point in the enc-plot should lie on or just below wrights curve in figure 5 all distributions lie below the theoretical curve an indication that not only mutational bias but also natural selection play non-negligible roles in the codon choices in all genes this is also exemplified by the violin plots in figure 6 showing the distances between the genes and wrights theoretical curve in the enc-plot genes n s and rdrp are more scattered below the theoretical curve than genes m and e implying that in the latter the codon usage patterns are pretty consistent with the effects of mutational bias interestingly data points corresponding to the gene n which is the major viral structural component needed to protect and encapsidate the viral rna are clustered more closely around gc3  05 see figure 5 this means that the displacement under wrights theoretical curve most likely reflects the selective pressure exerted on this gene conversely all other genes show a displacement towards lower values of gc3-content thereby corroborating our previously mentioned observation that coronaviruses tend to use codons that end with a and u see section 33 a neutrality plot analysis was performed to estimate the role of mutational bias and natural selection in shaping the codon usage patterns of the five genes under investigation in this plot the average gc-content in the first and second positions of codons gc12 is plotted against gc3s which is considered as a pure mutational parameter in figure 7 the neutrality plots obtained for genes m n s e and rdrp together with the best-fit lines and the slopes associated with them are shown to understand the rationale behind these results the wider the deviation between the slope of the regression line and the bisector the stronger the action of selective pressure all correlations are highly significant spearman correlationr2 analysis p-value  00001 by comparing the divergences between the regression lines and the bisectors in each panel we reveal that the five genes considered herein depend on a balance between natural selection and mutational bias specifically in line with the enc-plot analyses the genes s and rdrp present the largest deviations of their regression lines from the bisector lines thereby indicating a stronger action of natural selection conversely the regression line for the gene m is closer to the bisector than the other genes meaning that this gene is the least one subject to the action of natural selection finally the genes e and n are intermediate between the previous cases notably almost all data points are clustered below the bisector lines implying a selective tendency for a higher au content in the first two codon positions than in the third one additionally both gc3 and gc12 are lower than 05 reflecting a general preference for a and u bases in all three codon positions interestingly data points associated to gene m and e are closer to the bisector lines compared to genes n s and rdrp based on this observation we could suggest that the gc content in the first two codon positions tends to be in proportion to gc3 in genes m and e and this partially explains the closeness of these two genes to the wright theoretical curve in figure 5 we analyzed the dna divergence and protein sequence divergence that characterize these five genes by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the newly emerging sars-cov-2 and their corresponding protein sequences with those of other coronaviruses under study each sars-cov-2 gene was compared to its orthologous gene in the 30 coronaviruses to estimate evolutionary divergences each pair of orthologous genes is represented by a point in the forsdyke plot 26 where protein divergences correlated with dna divergence each point in the forsdyke plots measures the divergence between pairs of orthologous genes in the two species as projected along with the phenotypic protein and nucleotide dna axis thus the slope is an estimation of the fraction of dna mutations that result in amino acid substitutions 26 in figure 8 a separate forsdyke plot is shown for each gene overall protein and dna sequence divergences are linearly correlated and these correlations correspond to slopes and intercepts of the regression lines genes m and e display quite low slopes indicating that these proteins tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes conversely the steeper slopes for genes n rdrp and s suggest that these genes tend to evolve faster compared to other ones a plausible explanation for this observation is that protein n due to its immunogenicity has been frequently used to generate specific antibodies against various animal coronavirus including sars 42 the viral replicase polyprotein is essential for the replication of viral rna and finally gene s encodes the protein that is responsible for the spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses our results suggest that the higher divergence observed in these three proteins could represent a major obstacle to the development of an therapeutic treatment against sars-cov-2 to investigate the factors determining the codon usage patterns of sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses several analytical methods were used in our study first the rscu value of the sars-cov-2 was calculated despite the relatively high mutation rate that characterizes sars-cov-2 as other rna viruses we could not find any significant differences in codon usage between its genome and the ones of the other covs moreover their associated vectors did not cluster based on geographical position further confirming the common origin of these genomes in line with the common nucleotide composition of other rna viruses such as sars our results show that sars-cov-2 has a high au content and a low gc content the results also indicate that codon usage bias exists and that sars-cov-2 prefers u-ending codons the codon usage bias was further confirmed by a mean enc value of 519 a value greater than 45 is considered a slight codon usage bias due to mutation pressure or nucleotide compositional constraints these findings were also corroborated by the cai analysis which measures the deviation of a given protein coding gene sequence with respect to a reference set of the most highly expressed genes in the host this suggests that those rna viruses with high enc values and low cai adapt to the host with randomly chosen codons therefore a slightly biased codon usage pattern might allow the virus to use several codons for a respective amino acid and it might be beneficial for viral replication and translation in host cells we then analyzed in more detail the relationships between sars-cov-2 and various possible hosts other than humans for this purpose we calculated the average cai and sid values of individual sars-cov-2 genes against different candidate hosts although previous studies do not support transmission of sars-cov-2 from snakes to humans 3435 we showed that sars-cov-2 has the highest cai values by considering these two organisms as references and therefore it should use codons that are better optimized to snakes and humans moreover we demonstrated that the adaptiveness of sars-cov-2s codon usage as measured by sid is also fairly high for pangolins rats and bats thereby confirming previous hypotheses regarding the possible origin of sars-cov-2 from these species 9 the enc-plot analysis indicated that natural selection plays an important role in the codon choice of the five conserved viral genes under study namely rdrp s e m and n however genes ns and rdrp are more scattered below the theoretical curve compared to genes m and e implying that in the latter the codon usage is more a sign of mutational bias than of natural selection according to neutrality plot analysis the genes s and rdrp are considered to be subject to more robust action of natural selection gene m is the least subject to natural selection and the genes e and n are in an intermediate situation conversely the regression line for the gene m is closer to the bisector than the other genes meaning that this gene is the least subject to the action of natural selection finally the genes e and n are intermediately affected regarding the previous cases forsdyke plots were employed to analyze the mutation statuses of these five genes proteins m and e were found to have gentler slopes thereby reflecting a tendency to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their respective genes conversely the steeper slopes for the three genes n rdrp and s encoding a protein responsible for the spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses indicate that these three genes and therefore their corresponding protein products evolve faster compared to the other two genes interestingly all x-intercepts see table 4 are negative and the degree of negativity correlates with the low slope values recalling that the x-axis rna change can be viewed as a time axis it appears that the rna segments encoding m and e are as resistant to change during the early period of genome divergence negative x values as they are during the later period of divergence when phenotypic changes can be naturally selected positive x values m and e are less flexible at the protein level on the other hand the rna segments encoding s rdrp and n are flexible during the early genome divergence period high negative x values as a result these segments would have been more able to contribute to the initial genotypic divergence that would have decreased recombination between two genomes diverging in a common cell thereby facilitating speciation under the protection of this global reproductive isolation the segments could then evolve during the period corresponding to positive x values without reproductive isolation blending would have occurred and phenotypic divergence would be less possible in future studies it would be interesting to explore why m and e are less flexible and s r and n are more flexible towards preventing recombination viral rna recombination requires recognition between two comparable rna regions and then extensive base pairing mediated by the kissing stem-loop interaction to thoroughly examine sequence complementarity perhaps the m and e genes lack the ability to form stem-loops but this inflexibility during phenotypic divergence is suggestive of high conservation the findings of the present study could be useful for developing diagnostic reagents and probes for detecting a wide range of viruses and isolates in one test and for vaccine development utilizing the information about codon usage patterns in these genes in addition an interesting potential idea for the treatment of pneumonia-related to sars-cov-2 and other similar viruses is a low dose of ionizing radiation ldir sars-cov-2 is an rna virus with an expected mutation rate similar to other rna viruses as discussed above this mutation rate is usually much higher than the corresponding one of any human host therefore as discussed in a recent paper 43 any antiviral drug against sars-cov-2 would exert an intense selective pressure on the virus this may result in highly adaptive and treatment-resistant virus types with enhanced pathogenicity it should also be taken into consideration that the virus will create a systemic inflammatory response with detrimental effects in the host organism ie acute respiratory distress syndrome ards a form of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with major inflammatory injury to the lung cells and extravasation of protein-rich edema fluid into the airspace 4445 low dose radiation 05 gy has been shown to have indeed in some cases anti-inflammatory effects and to modulate the immune response and has even been suggested for treating pneumonia 46 this ldir exposure is not expected to exert significant selective pressure on the new coronavirus therefore and based also on recent suggestions one can hypothesize that a low dose treatment of 30 to 100 cgy to the lungs of a patient with covid-19 pneumonia could ameliorate the inflammation significantly and relieve the life-threatening systemic symptoms of the infection 47  prediction of amino acid pairs sensitive to mutations in the spike protein from sars related coronavirus guang wu shaomin yan   although the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has gone after hitting the world for several months everyone is intuitively expecting the possible return of sars in the near future and human logic seems to have such an assumption ie if the sars would return it would be another mutated form following its first battle with humans this is possible because the accumulating evidence shows that there are several mutations in sars related coronavirus sars-cov so far 15 point mutations have been documented in sars-cov proteins two in the 221 amino-acid-long membrane glycoprotein 2 15 17 19 24 three in the 1255 amino-acid-long spike glycoprotein 2 15 17 24 and ten in the 7073 amino-acid-long replicase polyprotein 2 8 11 15 16 17 24 naturally we would expect these three sars-cov proteins to have other forms of mutations rather than those documented and the new mutations would lead to the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of sars an intriguing question is whether or not we can predict the new mutations of sars-cov if so it would be greatly helpful for identification of sars-cov and a great advance in understanding of the evolutionary process in sars-cov also it would be useful for studying the mutant patterns in other human coronavirus which would give us some insight into the mutations in coronavirus among encoded structural replicase spike envelope membrane nucleocapsid proteins from human sars-cov the spike protein is incorporated into the viral envelope the spike proteins of coronaviruses are large type i membrane glycoproteins that are responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion the spike proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits s proteins also contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes and amino acid changes in the spike proteins can dramatically affect the virulence and in vitro host cell tropism of the virus 6 7 22 still at present it is only the spike glycoprotein in which a considerable amount of mutations has been documented using the blastp program to align three spike glycoproteins from humans we find little cue on the likelihood of which amino acid would mutate in sars spike glycoprotein in the past three years we have developed two models to analyze the primary structure in proteins 25 conducted a series of studies on mutations in different proteins 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 our studies show there is a clearly probabilistic pattern in the amino acids which are subject to mutations in this study we use our model to analyze two spike glycoproteins from human coronavirus in order to gain the insight on the prediction of amino acid pairs being sensitive to mutations in human sars-cov the spike protein from human sars-cov consists of 1255 amino acids the first and second amino acids are considered as an amino acid pair the second and third as another pair the third and fourth until the 1254th and 1255th thus there are 1254 pairs because there are 20 types of amino acids an amino acid pair can be composed from any of 20 types of amino acids so there are 400 types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs again there are 1254 pairs in the spike protein which are more than 400 types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs clearly some of 400 types should appear more than once meanwhile we may expect that some of 400 types are absent from the spike protein similarly there are 1172 and 1352 amino acid pairs in the spike proteins from strain 229e and oc43 respectively the randomly predicted frequency is governed by the simple permutation principle 9 for example there are 39 arginines r and 96 serines s in sars-cov spike protein the random frequency of amino acid pair rs would be 3 39125596125412542983 actually we can find three rss in the spike protein so the actual frequency of rs is 3 hence we have three relationships between actual and predicted frequencies ie the actual frequency is smaller than equal to and larger than the predicted frequency respectively as described in the last section the predicted frequency of randomly present pair rs would be 3 and rs does appear 3 times in the spike protein so the presence of rs is randomly predictable there are 84 alanines a in sars-cov spike protein the frequency of random presence of aa would be 6 84125583125412545555 ie there would be 6 aas in the spike protein in fact the aa appears 10 times in the spike protein so the presence of aa is randomly unpredictable this illustrates the case that the actual frequency of aa is larger than its predicted frequency another case is that the actual frequency is smaller than the predicted one for example there are 91 valines v in the spike protein and the predicted frequency of av is 6 84125591125412546091 whereas the actual frequency is only three there are 11 tryptophans w in sars-cov spike protein the frequency of random presence of rw would be 0 39125511125412540342 ie the rw would not appear in the spike protein which is true in the real situation thus the absence of rw is randomly predictable there are 99 threonines t in sars-cov spike protein the frequency of random presence of rt would be 3 39125599125412543076 ie there would be three rts in the spike protein however no rt is found in this protein therefore the absence of rt from the spike protein is randomly unpredictable a point missense mutation results in two amino acid pairs being substituted by another two as each pair has its actual and predicted frequencies the difference between them represents a probabilistic measure for the comparison in substituted and substituting amino acid pairs before and after mutation after calculating the predicted frequency and comparing with the actual frequency we can classify the substituted amino acid pairs into the predictableunpredictable amino acid pairs 
table 1
details the appearance of theoretically possible types of amino acids in three spike proteins for example the third row shows how many types do not appear from the viewpoint of amino acid pairs no matter the length of a protein is the number of its theoretically possible types cannot be more than 400 and therefore the difference between proteins is either how many types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs appear or how many times a theoretically possible type of amino acid pair repeats or both table 1 shows 59 86 and 66 types are absent from the spike protein of sars-cov strain 229e and strain oc43 third row in the table respectively still table 1 shows that 76 78 and 61 types appear once in the spike protein of sars-cov strain 229e and strain oc43 fourth row in the table respectively and so on the absent types include 17 randomly predictable and 42 randomly unpredictable with regard to sars-cov spike protein 37 randomly predictable and 49 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain 229e spike protein and 12 randomly predictable and 54 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain oc43 spike protein still we can classify the present amino acid pairs as randomly predictable and unpredictable with respect to theoretically possible types and pairs because some theoretically possible types appear many times from row 5 to row 23 in table 1 the columns 3 4 5 and 6 in table 2
show how many predictable and unpredictable types and pairs in human spike proteins when corresponding the position of each mutation to predictable pairs and unpredictable pairs we find that a vast majority of mutations occurs at the unpredictable pairs columns 7 8 9 and 10 in table 2 
fig 1
shows the ratios of frequency difference afpf versus mutation number per each type of substituted amino acid pairs in spike proteins it can be seen that there is a general tendency in the ratios ie the larger the difference the higher the chance of mutation occurring therefore the difference between actual and predicted frequencies indicates the potential chance of mutation occurring in amino acid pairs as the point missense mutations substitute one type of amino acid to another one we can gain some insight into the mutation tendency after comparing the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in substituted and substituting amino acid pairs for the numerical analysis we calculate the difference between actual frequency af and predicted frequency pf in amino acid pairs before and after mutation ie afpf for instance a mutation at position 244 substitutes i to t which results in two amino acid pairs di and iw changing to dt and tw because the amino acid is d at position 243 and w at position 245 the actual frequency and predicted frequency are 7 and 5 for di 1 and 1 for iw 2 and 6 for dt and 0 and 1 for tw respectively thus the difference between actual frequency and predicted frequency is 2 with regard to the substituted amino acid pairs ie 75112 and 5 with regard to the substituting amino acid pairs ie 26015 in this way we can compare the frequency difference in the amino acid pairs affected by mutations fig 2
shows the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in both substituted and substituting amino acid pairs in spike proteins it can be seen that the substituting pairs distribute more centrally and symmetrically than the substituted pairs do the sum of differences between actual and predicted frequencies is statistically smaller in substituting amino acid pairs than in substituted ones in table 3
the students t-test p005 these statistical differences suggest that the mutations lead to the deduction of difference between actual and predicted frequencies from a probabilistic viewpoint this means that the mutations are more likely to occur and these findings are similar to the results in our recent studies 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 as mentioned in section 2 the actual frequency can be equal to larger than or smaller than the predicted frequency accordingly we can look at these relationships with respect to the substituted table 4
 and substituting table 5
 pairs table 4 reveals that more than 75 of mutations occur at the pairs whose actual frequency is larger than their predicted frequency in one or both substituted pairs the first three rows in unpredictable pairs comparing the first three rows with the last two rows in unpredictable pairs we can see that the mutations are more likely to target the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than predicted frequencies therefore table 4 suggests which type of amino acid pairs are more likely to be substituted ie the different sensitivities of amino acid pairs to mutations in spike proteins 
table 5 shows in which types of amino acid pairs the mutations are likely or unlikely to form in spike proteins we can find that more than 60 of mutations result in one or both substituting pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies taking the results in both table 3 table 4 into account the mutations are likely to attack the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted ones and the consequences of mutations are likely to form the pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted ones in such a manner the mutations reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies fig 2 in this study we have analyzed the amino acid pairs affected by mutations in three spike proteins in order to gain some insight into the possible mutations from sars-cov firstly the present results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations table 2 although these 3 spike proteins are constructed by different types of amino acid pairs which repeat different times table 1 furthermore the larger the difference between actual and predicted frequencies is the higher the chance of mutation occurring is fig 1 the effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies fig 2 finally the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations table 4 whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations table 5 these findings are identical to our recently publications 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 combining the results with our previous studies our model suggests that the mutations go along a pathway which is probabilistically more likely to occur as such a pathway is less energy- and time-consuming in fact the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases although this study shows that the mutations in the spike proteins from strains 229e and oc43 go along the direction of degeneration ie the mutations go along a probabilistically easy pathway the documented evidence in literature still cannot suggest whether or not the mutations belong to degeneration in the spike protein from human sars-cov if the potential mutations in the spike protein from sars-cov would go along a probabilistically easy pathway according to the results obtained from our analysis we should pay more attention to the amino acid pairs with the following characteristics for potential mutations ie the amino acid pairs with large difference between actual and predicted frequencies and their actual frequencies larger than predicted frequencies table 6
lists the amino acid pairs with the frequency difference being larger than 3 in spike protein from sars-cov as these amino acid pairs seem to be more vulnerable to mutations fig 1 with these sensitive amino acid pairs in mind we can easily determine their positions for example the nfs are located at positions 129130 178179 230231 304305 526527 528529 699700 783784 951952 10561057 and 10901091 in spike protein from sars-cov moreover we notice that the positions of fns overlap with nfs at positions from 526 to 530 at which the highly possible mutations would be more likely to occur this hypothesis can be supported by the mutations found in other proteins such as human collagen 5iv chain precursor 29 p53 protein 34 and so on in such a manner we could predict the potential mutations in the spike protein from human sars-cov with possible amino acid pairs and positions  an arginine-to-proline mutation in a domain with undefined functions within the helicase protein nsp13 is lethal to

coronavirus causes an acute and contagious disease in chickens with a significant impact on the poultry industry worldwide ibv contains a 276 kb single-stranded positive-sense rna genome in the virus-infected cells six mrna species including the genome-length mrna 1 and five subgenomic mrnas mrna 26 are produced by a discontinuous rna transcription mechanism each mrna species possesses a 64 nucleotides leader sequence derived from the 5 end of the genome boursnell et al 1987 subgenomic mrnas 2 3 4 and 6 encode the four structural proteins ie spike glycoprotein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n the 5 two-third region of mrna 1 comprises two large orfs 1a and 1b and encodes two polyproteins the two polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved by two

in general ibv shares close similarities in the genome organization gene expression and rna replication with other coronaviruses but is non-infectious to human these properties make ibv an attractive model system for studying the biology and pathogenesis of coronavirus in construction of an infectious ibv clone by in vitro assembly of five cloned rt-pcr fragments from a vero cell-adapted ibv beaudette strain a gc g15526c point mutation at nucleotide position 15526 was found to be lethal to the infectivity of ibv on vero cells no infectious virus could be rescued from vero cells electroporated with in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing this mutation as this mutation causes arg132pro mutation in a domain with unknown function within the helicase protein nsp13 it implies that this region might play certain roles in the functionality of the helicase protein on the contrary a gc g4330c and a ga g9230 point mutations at nucleotide positions 4330 and 9230 respectively causing glugln and glyglu mutations in or near the catalytic centers of the papain-like nsp3 and 3c-like nsp5 proteinases did not impair the infectivity of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts containing these mutations further characterization of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing the g15526c mutation demonstrated that this mutation blocks the transcription of subgenomic rnas substitution mutation of the arg132 residue to a positively charged amino acid lys affected neither the infectivity of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts nor the growth properties of the rescued virus however mutation of the arg132 residue to a leu which is conserved in most of other coronaviruses at the same position reduced the viral recovery rate of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts the mutant virus showed much smaller-sized plaques this study reveals the essential role of a domain with previously unassigned functions within the helicase protein in coronavirus replication to construct a full-length ibv clone five fragments a to e spanning the entire ibv genome were obtained by rt-pcr of total rna extracted from vero cells infected with a vero cell-adapted ibv beaudette strain p65 shen et al 2003 shen et al 2004 fang et al 2005 to facilitate the assembly of the full-length cdna in vitro restriction sites for either bsmbi or bsai were introduced into both the 5 and 3 ends of the fragments fig 1a in fragment a a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the t7 rna promoter table 1
 was inserted into the 5 end of the ibv genome to facilitate in vitro transcription using the t7 polymerase fig 1a the primers used to amplify these fragments are listed in table 1 the pcr products were purified from agarose gel and cloned into either pcr-xl-topo invitrogen or pgem-t easy promage vectors for the convenience of digestion using the restriction enzyme bsmbi the nhei- and ecori-digested fragment a was subcloned into pkt0 which contains a bsmbi site 400 bp upstream of the t7 promoter sequence fig 1a two to three independent clones for each construct were selected for sequencing the complete sequences of the five fragments determined by automated nucleotide sequencing are summarized in table 2
 the five fragments were then prepared by digestion of the corresponding constructs with either bsmbi or bsai and purified fig 1b lanes 26 the full-length clone was made by ligation of the purified fragments in vitro fig 1b lane 8 and used as the template for in vitro transcription the full-length in vitro-synthesized transcripts were generated using the mmessage mmachine t7 kit ambion austin tex fig 1b lane 10 as coronavirus n gene transcripts were shown to enhance the recovery of the rescued virus from the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts casais et al 2001 youn et al 2005a youn et al 2005b yount et al 2000 yount et al 2002 the n transcripts were generated from a linearized pkt0-ibvn construct containing ibv n gene and the 3-utr region the full-length transcripts together with the n transcripts were introduced into vero cells by electroporation however it was consistently observed that no infectious virus could be recovered from cells transfected with the full-length transcripts together with the n transcripts sequencing comparison of the five fragments with the vero cell-adapted ibv strain p65 accession no dq001339 shows nucleotide changes at 16 positions table 2 among them 11 caused unique amino acid changes table 2 to assess the deleterious effects of these mutations on the infectivity of the full-length clone correction of some of the mutations was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis three point mutations g4330c g9230a and g15526c were chosen based on the fact that they are located either in or near the catalytic centers of the two viral proteinases or in a region of the rna helicase protein with undefined functions four full-length cdna clones either with correction of the mutations at all three positions ribv or combination of two positions eg g4330c containing gc mutation at nucleotide position 4330 but without mutations at the other two positions were constructed rna transcripts generated from the four full-length cdna clones were introduced into vero cells together with the n transcripts by electroporation at 2 days post-electroporation a typical cpe of the vero cell-adapted ibv the formation of giant syncytial cells fang et al 2005 was observed in cells transfected with transcripts generated from cdna clones ribv g4330c and g9230a cpe was extended to almost the whole monolayers at 3 days post-electroporation fig 2a no cpe was observed in cells transfected with transcripts generated from clone g15526c fig 2a rt-pcr analysis of the subgenomic mrna 5 was performed to confirm if cpe observed is caused by the replication of ibv sequencing of the rt-pcr fragment generated from cells transfected with ribv showed correct sequence in the leaderbody junction region of the subgenomic mrna fig 2b further sequencing of the rt-pcr fragments covering regions with unique amino acid mutations confirmed the recovery of ibv ribv from the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts compared to the parent ibv strains ribv contains 8 amino acid mutations table 2 to test if these mutations may affect the growth properties and genetic stability of the rescued virus ribv was propagated on vero cells for 5 passages and the plaque sizes and growth kinetics were determined and compared with wild type ibv p65 in cells infected with ribv the average plague size is 056  0028 mm which is slightly smaller than the average plaque size of 068  0034 mm in cells infected with wild type ibv fig 3a analysis of the growth curves demonstrated that ribv exhibited very similar growth properties as the wild type virus fig 3a further characterization of ribv was subsequently carried out by analysis of viral rnas and structural proteins northern blot and western blot analyses showed the detection of very similar amounts of viral rnas fig 3b and s n and m proteins fig 3c in cells infected with wild type and ribv respectively at 24 h post-infection when probing with anti-n protein antibodies other species migrating faster than the full-length products on sds-page were also observed fig 3c they may represent premature termination and cleavage products of n protein unpublished observation it was also noted that variable amounts of these species were detected in cells infected with wild type and ribv fig 3c the significance of these variations is unclear at the moment taken together these results confirm that ribv is stable and possesses very similar growth properties as wild type ibv as no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with g15526c mutant transcripts rt-pcr amplification of the negative strand rna was performed to check if rna replication occurred in these transfected cells total rna was extracted from vero cells transfected with wild type and g15526c mutant transcripts at 24 and 48 h post-electroporation respectively reverse transcription was performed by using equal amount of rna and the sense-primer ibv14931-f 5-14931gcttatccactagtacatc14949-3 and pcr was carried out by using the sense-primer ibv14931-f and the antisense-primer ibv15600-r 5-15600cttctcgcacttctgcactagca15578-3 if replication of viral rna occurred a 670 bp pcr fragment would be expected as shown in fig 4a rt-pcr fragments amplified from negative strand rna templates were obtained from cells transfected with both wild type lanes 2 and 4 and the mutant transcripts lanes 3 and 5 sequencing of the pcr fragments confirmed that they represent the correct sequences as a negative control the in vitro-synthesized transcripts were mixed with total rna extracted from normal vero cells and were used as a template for rt-pcr no rt-pcr fragment was detected fig 4a lane 6 confirming that the detection of negative strand rna from cells transfected with mutant transcripts is due to the replication of viral rna further quantitation of the negative strand rna transcription in cells transfected with wild type and g15526c mutant transcripts was carried out by real-time pcr at 24 and 48 h post-electroporation transcription of the negative rna in cells electroporated with wild type transcripts was 2476- and 94554-fold respectively higher than that in cells electroporated with the g15526c mutant transcripts these results confirm that transcription of the negative strand rna has taken place in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts but with much lower efficiency rt-pcr amplification of subgenomic mrnas was carried out to check if a low level of subgenomic mrna synthesis could occur in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts total rna prepared from the transfected cells 2 days post-electroporation was used in the rt reaction with the sense-primer ibv-leader 5-26ctattacactagccttgcgct46-3 for the detection of negative-stranded sgrna and the antisense-primer ibv24803-r 5-24803ctctggatccaataacctac24784-3 for the detection of positive-stranded sgrna the two primers were then used for pcr if transcription of subgenomic mrnas did occur a 415 bp pcr product corresponding to the 5-terminal region of the subgenomic mrna 4 and a 1010 bp fragment corresponding to the 5-terminal region of the subgenomic mrna 3 would be expected as shown in fig 4b a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild type full-length transcripts at 2 days post-electroporation lanes 2 and 5 sequencing of the pcr fragments confirmed that they represent the correct sequences of the corresponding regions of the subgenomic mrnas 3 and 4 respectively however the same pcr products were not detected in cells electroporated with the mutant transcripts fig 4b lanes 3 and 6 as a negative control the amplified fragments were not detected in cells without electroporation fig 4b lane 4 the failure to detect both negative- and positive-stranded sgrnas in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts show that the g15526c mutation leads to the disruption of subgenomic rna transcription to further demonstrate that the failure to rescue infectious virus from the g15526c mutant transcripts is due to a defect in subgenomic rna transcription the full-length clones with and without the g15526c mutation were used to generate recombinant ibv expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp by replacing the 5a gene with egfp full-length transcripts containing egfp were synthesized in vitro and introduced into vero cells together with the n transcripts by electroporation at 2 days post-electroporation single cpe with the expression of egfp was observed in cells transfected with the full-length transcripts without the g15526c mutation fig 4c gradually increased cpe and fluorescent cells were observed from 3 to 5 days post-electroporation fig 4c at 5 days post-electroporation cpe and fluorescent cells were extended to almost the whole monolayer fig 4c however it was consistently observed that much less infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with this construct furthermore the recombinant virus rapidly lost infectivity when passaged on vero cells the recovered virus maintains minor infectivity only for one passage in cells transfected with the full-length transcripts containing the g15526c mutation neither cpe nor cells expressing egfp were observed fig 4c demonstrating that g15526c mutation led to total demolition of the egfp expression as egfp could be expressed only if subgenomic rnas were synthesized but can be observed even if a single cell was transfected and expressed the protein to a certain level these results reinforce the conclusion that the g15526c mutation blocks subgenomic rna transcription g15526c mutation resulted in the substitution mutation of the r132 with a pro r132p of the helicase protein sequence comparison of the ibv helicase protein with other known coronaviruses showed that r132 residue is located adjacent to a conserved motif fig 5a in all sequenced coronaviruses only ibv has a charged amino acid r132 at this position fig 5a to assess if a positive charge amino acid at this position is essential for the function of the protein mutation of r132 to a lys r132k was carried out meanwhile a conserved leu residue ile in the case of tgev was found at this position in all other coronaviruses mutation of r132 to a leu r132l was also included in vitro full-length transcripts containing the r132k and r132l mutations were electroporated into vero cells as shown in fig 5b transcripts generated from wild type r132 and r132k mutant constructs showed very similar infectivity after introduction into vero cells typical cpe was observed in large areas of the monolayers at 3 days post-electroporation fig 5b and recombinant viruses were recovered however r132l transcripts were found to be less infectious in cells electroporated with transcripts generated from this mutant typical cpe was observed in much restricted areas of the monolayer at 3 days post-electroporation fig 5b the growth properties of the r132k and r132l mutant viruses on vero cells were tested by analysis of plaque sizes and growth curves of passage 5 mutant viruses compared to cells infected with wild type recombinant virus average plaques size is 056  0028 plaques with similar size were observed in cells infected with the r132k mutant virus fig 6a the average plaque size in cells infected with r132k mutant virus is 059  0029 mm in cells infected with the r132l mutant virus much smaller-sized plaques were observed fig 6a the average plaque size in cells infected with this mutant virus is 024  0017 mm however analysis of the growth curves of wild type and mutant viruses demonstrated that the mutant viruses exhibited very similar or even better growth properties as the wild type recombinant virus fig 6a the r132k and r132l mutant viruses were subsequently characterized by analysis of viral rnas and structural proteins northern blot analysis showed the detection of very similar amounts of genomic and subgenomic rnas in cells infected with ribv and the two mutant viruses at 24 h post-infection fig 6b similarly western blot analysis of cells infected with ribv r132k and r132l mutant viruses showed that similar amounts of s n and m proteins were detected at 24 h post-infection fig 6c lanes 13 when probing with anti-n protein antibodies other species migrating faster than the full-length products on sds-page were also observed fig 6c they may represent premature termination and cleavage products of n protein unpublished observation it was also noted that variable amounts of these species were detected in cells infected with wild type and different mutants fig 6c the genetic stability of r132k and r132l mutant viruses was tested by propagation of the viruses on vero cells for 5 passages sequencing analysis of the fifth passages of the two mutant viruses showed that the mutations are stable no reversion to the original sequences or mutation to other nucleotides was found in the position in vitro assembly of full-length coronavirus clones generation of full-length transcripts in vitro using a bacteriophage dna-dependent rna polymerase and recovery of infectious viruses by introduction of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts into cells first used by yount et al 2000 are a rapid and reliable approach to construct infectious clones from large rna viruses it has been successfully used to construct infectious clones for several coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev mouse hepatitis virus mhv sars-cov and ibv youn et al 2005a youn et al 2005b yount et al 2000 yount et al 2003 in the process of developing an infectious ibv clone from a vero cell-adapted ibv beaudette strain using this approach a gc point mutation at nucleotide position 15526 was found to be lethal to the infectivity of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts on vero cells no infectious virus could be rescued from vero cells electroporated with transcripts containing this mutation this mutation causes arg132pro substitution in a domain within the helicase protein nsp13 with undefined functions indicating that this domain may be essential for the functionality of the helicase protein multiple enzymatic activities have been assigned to the nsp13 helicase protein these include rna and dna duplex-unwinding activities ntpase and dntpase activities and an rna 5-triphosphatase activity that might be involved in the formation of the 5-cap structure of viral rnas ivanov et al 2004 the protein is comprised of two domains a putative n-terminal zinc binding domain which spans the n-terminal region of the protein from approximately amino acids 1 to 77 and a c-terminal helicase domain covering the c-terminal part of the protein from amino acids 279 to the c-terminal end ivanov et al 2004 a serpro substitution located immediately downstream of the putative zinc binding domain of nsp10 the equivalent rna helicase protein in equine arteritis virus eav caused defect in subgenomic mrna transcription van dinten et al 1997 van dinten et al 2000 more detailed analysis of the zinc binding domain of nsp10 from eav and nsp13 from human coronavirus 229e by mutagenesis studies showed that this domain could modulate the enzymatic activities of the helicase domain seybert et al 2005 through this regulatory role and some yet to be discovered mechanisms the zinc binding domain is shown to be critically involved in the replication and transcription of coronavirus rna in this study introduction of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing the g15526c r132p mutation was shown to be totally defective in subgenomic rna transcription a phenotype similar to but appears to be much more severe than the serpro mutation in eav van dinten et al 1997 van dinten et al 2000 mutation of the arg132 residue to a positively charged amino acid lys does not affect the infectivity of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts as well as the growth properties of the rescued virus however mutation of the arg132 residue to leu a conserved residue at the same position in most of other known coronaviruses impaired the recovery rate of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts the recovered mutant virus showed much smaller-sized plaques the r132 residue is located 57 amino acids downstream of the last his h75 residue in the putative zinc binding domain fig 5a and 147 amino acids upstream of the helicase motif 1 seybert et al 2005 so far no functional domain has been found in this region of the helicase protein why the r132p substitution located outside of the two functional domains of the helicase protein shows severe phenotypic defect in subgenomic rna transcription and the infectivity of ibv is not clear at the moment three possibilities were considered first r132 may be part of the n-terminal zinc binding domain as no studies have been attempted to define the boundary of the two domains it is not even certain that an independent domain with unique function may exist in this region r132p mutant virus shares certain phenotypic similarity to the serpro mutant eav such as the absence of subgenomic mrna transcription van dinten et al 1997 van dinten et al 2000 suggesting that the two mutations might disrupt a similar function of the helicase protein however as biochemical characterization of the effect of r132p mutation on the enzymatic activities of ibv nsp13 helicase protein is currently lacking it would be difficult to draw a conclusion that the two mutants share mechanistically similar characteristics second r132 is located in a region with a high degree of amino acid conservation in all known coronaviruses since the main defect of r132p mutant virus is in the subgenomic rna transcription one possibility is that this region may be involved in the subgenomic rna synthesis by interacting with host or other viral functional proteins alternatively as a positively charged amino acid is required to maintain the full function of the protein it would be possible that this region may be involved in binding of the helicase protein to viral rna during rna replication and transcription finally mutation to a pro would lead to the disruption of the three dimensional structures of the two domains biochemical characterization of the involvement of this region in the enzymatic activities of the protein and determination of its three dimensional structures are underway to address these possibilities the g433c eq point mutation near the catalytic center of the plp domain in nsp3 affects neither the recovery of infectious virus from the full-length synthesized in vitro transcripts nor the infectivity of the rescued virus similarly efficient recovery of infectious virus from the in vitro transcripts containing the g9230a ge point mutation in the 3clp was obtained the two mutant viruses are genetically stable and show similar growth properties with the wild type recombinant virus even though the two mutations are located in or near the catalytic centers of the two viral proteinases the mutations did not alter their enzymatic activities this relatively high degree of tolerance to mutations in non-essential regions of important functional proteins would minimize the occurrence of lethal mutations during the replication cycles of rna viruses and increase the adaptability of these viruses to a changed environment vero cells were cultured at 37 c in minimal essential medium mem supplemented with 10 fetal

for use in diagnosis and drug design manish tiwari divya mishra asaf marg ali  this study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples this analysis will provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome novel coronavirus has wrecked medical and health care facilities claiming 5 death tolls globally all efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largely remained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus in the present study we compared the 2019-ncov with other coronaviruses which indicated that bat-sars like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus the protein sequence similarity of pangolin-hcov and bat-hcov with human coronavirus was higher as compared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutations in the genome phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from group i to group v revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acid changes detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type the non-synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed over different hcov proteins with maximum on spike protein an important diamino acid change rg to kr was observed in orf9 protein additionally several interesting features of the novel coronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruses which may explain extreme pathogenicity infectivity and simultaneously the reason behind failure of the antiviral therapies  current and last two decades saw emergence of zoonotic coronavirus cov crossing the species barrier ultimately infecting human species resulting in pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers drosten et al 2003 zaki et al 2012  an apocalyptic threat is posed by a sempiternal pathogen ruining the health and the economies on global scale a severe pneumonia outbreak starting in december 2019 in the wuhan city hubei province china was caused by novel cov referred as 2019 novel coronavirus or  2019 -ncov huang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020  covs are rna viruses with wide host pathogenesis in mammals including humans pangolins and birds genetically the covs were categorised into four major genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus li 2016  the alpha and beta covs infect mammals whereas the gamma and delta covs infect birds tang et al 2015  primary symptoms associated with cov infection include respiratory hepatic enteric and neurological diseases previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of covs hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 sars-cov and mers-cov which can infect the human species hcov-nl63 hcov-229e belongs to alphacov genus while rest belongs to betacov genus tang et al 2015  the betacovs appears to be prima-facie genre of covs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades recently the 2019-ncov outbreak spread from china to the intercontinental arena and already infected 03 million people globally claiming 13000 43 deaths till 21 st march 2020 httpswwwworldometersinfocoronaviruscountries china and italy were the epicentres until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future genome sequence analysis of sars mers and 2019-ncov confirmed its presence in betacovs family and divergence from the other two viruses zhu et al 2020  the 2019-ncov is a positivestrand rna viruses with 29 kb genome size 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading frames orfs song et al 2019  viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins namely envelope e spike s membrane m and 3-5 nucleocapsid n proteins the genome starts with short untranslated regions 5 utr followed by genes 5-replicase rep gene s e m n and 3 utr song et al 2019  two-third of the genome is represented by the rep gene at 5 end which encodes for non-structural protein nsp spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre du et al 2009 du et al  2017  viral assembly relies primarily on m and e proteins and rna synthesis is achieved by action of n protein song et al 2019  to mitigate the severity of 2019-ncov researchers around the world are trying to develop antibodies and vaccine against this deadly virus the problem with the delay in antiviral medication is superficial understanding of the virus a dire need is to unravel the mutations in the viral genome and concomitant amino acid changes occurring presumably due to varying geographical location or upon interaction with the diverse human immune system various reports compared the sars mers bat and pangolin coronaviruses and paved way for significant findings still leaving a lacunae in terms of the variations in the hcov genomes and comparison with the previous available viruses resources the present study deals with the mutations in the hcov genomes and resulting change in amino acids genomic features may provide an important clue about the relatedness and evolution of the organism in order to get an insight into the similitude and dissimilitude between human novel coronavirus hcov and other coronaviruses the genome sequence of human novel coronavirus hcov were compared with bat coronavirus gu1902151 drexler et al 2010  severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus strain btky72 ky3524071 tao and tong 2019  bat sars-like coronavirus isolate bat-sl-covzc45 mg7729331 hu et al 2018  hcov-19pangolinguangdong12019epi isl 410721 pangolin-hcov and hcov-19batyunnanratg132013epi isl bat-hcov which revealed approximately 81 81 89 90 and 96 similarity respectively table 1  to further assess the relationship between hcov and other coronaviruses alignment and phylogenetic analysis was carried out alignment of hcov with above mentioned viruses showed that several nucleotide sites were unique in hcov sequences when compared to other coronaviruses table s1  among these sites ct hcov other coronavirus is the most prevalent substitution followed by tc ga and ag table s1  many regions were absent in bat and sars coronavirus genome when compared to hcov bat-hcov and pangolin-hcov among these regions one of largest portion is of 391 nt 28026-28417 coding for orf8 protein in hcov putatively involved in interspecies transmission lau et al 2015  genomic similarities and alignment indicate that several mutation events over the time is responsible for 5 emergence of human novel coronavirus further a phylogenetic analysis between these viruses displayed that hcovs are closer to batsars-like virus mg7729331 and distant from sars coronavirus ky3524071 and bat coronavirus gu1902151 figure 1  these results demonstrate that sars coronavirus and bat coronavirus gu1902151 could be apparent ancestor of other coronaviruses studied in the investigation scrutiny of nucleotide and amino acid in coding region of the genome revealed that the hcov genome share 9267 and 9692 similarity at nucleotide level with pangolins and bat hcov genome whereas the similarity level increased up to 9782 and 9867 at amino acid level table 2  this indicates that most substitutions taking place were of synonymous type among various protein coding genes nsp4-10 nsp12-14 nsp16 m e and orf6 shared highly conserve amino acid composition between bat-hcov and hcov with 99 similarity especially nsp7-10 nsp16 e and orf6 share 100 amino acid similarity  table 2  the 100 similarity in these regions across 591 hcovs bat and pangolin-hcov mark them to be a probable target region for future antibodies and vaccine therapy notably nsp2 and nsp14 region in hcovs were most diversified in terms of nucleotide when compared to pangolin and bat-hcov whereas orf10 and e regions were the least diverse table 2  we investigated the phylogenetic analysis of 591 genomic sequences of hcov obtained from gisaid database using raxml methods the phylogram was majorly divided into 5 groups based on their clade division bat and pangolin-hcov were categorized in the group i and all other hcovs were categorized in group ii to v  figure 2  group ii comprises of the human 2019-ncov mainly belonging to different province of china however few exceptions were also from south korea japan vietnam chile usa india belgium spain germany and france hcovs group iii mainly comprised of the hcovs belonging to usa while group iv represented the hcovs of mixed type population belonging to several countries distributed over continents group v possess the hcov from european countries along with few hcovs of america and one from taiwan to understand mystery underlying the clustering pattern of the hcovs bat and pangolin-hcov were used as a reference sequence to observe the nucleotide substitution in hcov members in different groups interestingly hcov members group ii and group iii falling in proximity to group i have less substitution in the genome sequences table   s2  the tc groupv-hcovbat-hcov and groupv-hcovpangolin-hcov substitution were frequent in group v as compared to hcov representing other groups table s2   the genomic signature of usa-hcovs present in group v is very different from usa-hcovs of group iii this could be indicative of differences between direct and community transmission of the virus member belonging to each subgroup has distinct genomic features in terms of nucleotide substitution table s2   genomic comparison of 591 hcov sequences among the human as well as with pangolin-hcov and bat-hcov revealed several sites possessing substitutions which clearly indicated the mutation in viral genome either according to the geographical locations or upon interaction with the human immune system the nucleotide substitution in hcov genomes were predominantly of transition type with 45 being ct  figure 3a  a detailed investigation of the nucleotide substitution in the coding region of hcovs genome with perspective of encoded amino acids revealed 43 synonymous and 57 non-synonymous substitutions  table s3  the proteins nsp1 nsp5 nsp7-10 nsp14-16 orf4 orf7a orf7b and orf10 mainly possessed synonymous substitutions and hence were mostly devoid of amino acid changes  figure 3b  the 57 amino acid changes were distributed over 12 regions in the 30kb genome the number of amino acids substitutions varied between different regions such as 7 in nsp2 10 in nsp3 5 in nsp4 3 in nsp6 1 in nsp12 4 in nsp13 11 in spike 3 in orf3a 2 in orf5 1 in orf6 2 in orf8 and 8 in orf9 figure 4  intriguingly various important non-synonymous mutations were observed majorly in european and us continent while the mutations were mostly synonymous in asian continent these interesting observations can be used to infer the reason behind larger infectivity and pathogenicity in these regions table s3  further two type of amino acid change viz conservative and radial replacements were intensively studied with respect to previous reports stating the effect of such changes on the enzymatic activities mutations were most prevalent in the spike region followed by nsp2 nsp3 and orf9 n table s3  spike region determines the specific binding to host receptor and initiation of viral replication this region is reported to be the most potent and indispensable for viral attachment and entry into host system the rrar amino acids found only in the human covs spike region has proved to be essential for binding to host receptor walls et al 2020  we observed similar region in the hcov genomes studied 23713-23724 region in nucleotide alignment although there was mutation in two hcov-england nucleotide sequences ctccgcggcggg in place of ctcctcggcggg but the resulting amino acid remained same in all hcov genomes these findings corroborate the essentiality of rrar sequence for viral infection to host system we found different type of mutation in hcov spike protein at different places such as leucine to valine l8v glutamine to histidine q675h and also found in orf3aq57h glutamine to lysine q239k and aspartate to glycine d614g and also found in orf5 d3g might have potential role to augment viral infection table s3  previous investigations showed mutations such as leucine to valine change in retroviral envelope protein glutamine to lysine in influenza virus glutamine to histidine and aspartate to glycine in h1n1 had a severe impact in virus entry replication and cross infectivity to other species ct et al 2012 glinsky 2010 yamada et al 2010  additionally mutations were present in structural proteins such as glycine to valine mutation in orf3a g196v and g251v similar amino acid change imparts resistance against inhibitor drug saquinavir in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 this might provide an explanation why drugs used for treating hiv became a failure in case of hcov infection hong et al 1997  notably in orf9 region the nucleotide sequence ggg changed to aac in european and american continent resulting in a change of amino acid from rg to kr agggga coding for rg changed to aaacga coding for kr 28993-28995 in nucleotide alignment furthermore several amino acid changes were also observed in the non-structural proteins nsp of the hcovs which may affect the virulence and titer threonine to isoleucine substitution was observed in different nsp proteins nsp2t85i nsp3t127i and t1030i and nsp4t295i mainly in european and us samples earlier reports established that threonine to isoleucine substitution increased viral infectivity of ebola virus and resistance to ganciclovir in human cytomegalovirus kurosaki et al 2018 wolf et al 1995  importantly alanine to valine substitution in non-structural protein ns2a in zika virus affects viral rna synthesis and results in vivo viral attenuation marquez-jurado et al 2018  this mutated virus also induce a comprehensive protection against lethal challenge proposed by the wild type zika virus falling in similar lines alanine to valine substitutions in non-structural proteins nsp3 a1187v nsp4 a457v and nsp6 a46v could reduce viral lethality of hcovs table s3  these mutations might pave way towards identification of less lethal strains and help to raise immunity to counteract the noxious strains an isoleucine to valine mutation nsp2 i559v and nsp3 i797v and methionine to isoleucine nsp4 m33i were observed in hcovs change of isoleucine to valine in polymerase subunit pb2 of influenza virus resulted in critically enhanced activity of reconstituted polymerase complex rolling et al 2009  and m to i substitution in hiv-1 reverse transcriptase imparted resistance to nucleoside analog 23-dideoxy-3thiacytidine 3tc julias et al 2004  interestingly presence of a non-synonymous substitution in rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp region in majority of european hcov samples resulted in change of amino acid from proline to leucine p314l it will be quite interesting to validate the effect of this substitution on rdrp activity as one of the previous study established that similar change of proline-to-leucine substitution p236l of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase imparts resistance against a highly specific inhibitor bisheteroarylpiperazines bhaps fan et al 1995  these examples clearly show that amino acid changes may significantly affect the functional competency of polymerase and the associated subunits in conclusion present study enlightens about several types of mutation such as deletion insertion and substitutions present in 2019-ncov samples these mutations may vary at different geographical distribution or interaction with different host systems few mutations also resulted in change of amino acid which may provide an explanation for failure of previously employed antiviral therapies this research will better equip the researchers to utilize the mutated amino acid information for drug targets in particular geography and less cases of failure beside the substitution resulting into transformation to a more virulent strain there are number of highly conserved regions in the hcov genome which can be used as target for inhibitory drugs and vaccine development for a large repertoire of strains finally we believe that our data provide useful information pertaining the changes in genomic and proteomic features which could serve as a guide to design the future antiviral therapies and diagnostics to analyse the phylogenetic relationship between different coronaviruses 591 genomes were downloaded from global initiative on sharing all influenza database gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg the hcov is an rna virus and the deposited sequences are in dna format to prevent anomaly in the data represented complete genomes and only high coverage datasets were utilized the genomic sequences were aligned using muscle program v3831 edgar 2004  the alignments were utilized to deduce various nucleotide substitutions and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstrap was constructed by raxml program stamatakis 2014  the alignment and tree were visualized using jalview 2110 waterhouse et al 2009  and itol respectively letunic and peer 2007  different substitutions and resulting amino acid changes were analyzed between human bat pangolin and sars coronavirus genomes to deduce a mutation or amino acid change only those confirmed in three individual genomes were considered replicates for biological significance identity with

replication sunil lal k pinghua liu julian leibowitz   coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense nonsegmented enveloped rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae one of the three families in the order nidovirales they are the largest known rna viruses with 2731 kb genomes coronaviruses are classified as group 1 2 and 3 based on serologic relatedness genome organization and sequence similarity extensive phylogenetic comparisons placed the sars coronavirus sars-cov as an early branch of the group 2 coronaviruses snijder et al 2003 for all coronaviruses the 5 two-thirds of the genome comprise the replicase gene and the 3 genes encode structural proteins and nonessential accessory proteins coronaviruses infect cells by binding to specific receptors and enter cells by direct membrane fusion at the plasma membrane or by an endocytotic mechanismnash and buchmeier 1997 wang et al 2008 sars-cov uses angiotension-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as its functional receptor li et al 2003 and enters cells through ph- and receptor-dependent endocytosis wang et al 2008 upon entering the cytoplasm the virus particle is uncoated releasing the rna genome the viral genome directs the synthesis of two large polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab via a frameshifting mechanism involving a pseudoknot structure brierley et al 1987 the resulting polypeptide contains a conserved array of functional domains which upon proteolytic processing results in 1516 nonstructural proteins nsp many of which are likely to be involved in either rna synthesis or proteolytic processing of the polyprotein precursors of nsp116 snijder et al 2003 the 3 one-third of the genome contains the genes for viral structural proteins and accessory proteins these genes are expressed by transcription of a 3 coterminal nested set of 79 mrnas that also contain a common 7090 nucleotide nt 5 leader identical in sequence to the 5 end of the genome lai et al 1983 1984 spaan et al 1982 the 3 end of the leader sequence contains a short 68 nt sequence the transcriptional regulatory sequence trs also present in the genome just 5 to the coding sequence for each mrna budzilowicz et al 1985 subgenomic negative-sense rnas that correspond to each subgenomic rna are found in infected cells sethna et al 1989 as are replication intermediates containing subgenome-length negative strands sawicki and sawicki 1990 in the currently accepted model subgenomic mrnas are transcribed from a complementary set of subgenome-size minus-strand rnas produced by discontinuous minus-strand synthesis molecular genetic studies with viruses containing mutations in the trs support a model where leader-body joining takes place during synthesis of subgenomic negative-sense rnas zuniga et al 2004 pasternak et al 2001 van marle et al 1999 senseantisense base-pairing interactions between short conserved sequences play a key regulatory role in this process coronavirus rna transcription occurs in the cytoplasm all the coronavirus mrnas have a common leader sequence at their 5 ends spaan et al 1982 the leader sequence contains a transcription regulatory sequence trs-l at its 3 end this sequence motif constitutes part of the signal for subgenomic mrna transcription preceding every transcription unit on the viral genomic rna are additional transcription regulatory elements named body transcription regulatory sequence trs-b budzilowicz et al 1985 all coronavirus trss can be divided into three sequence blocks the core 68 nt sequence cs plus 5 and 3 flanking sequences sola et al 2005 the most frequently used cs for group 1 coronaviruses is a hexamer 5-cuaaac-3 for group 2 coronaviruses a heptameric sequence 5-ucuaaac-3 is the consensus sequence it is almost identical to the group i cs interestingly sars-cov has a cs 5-acgaac-3 which differs from other group 2 coronaviruses marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 the cs for group 3 coronaviruses is a divergent octamer 5-cuuaacaa-3 alonso et al 2002 the related arterivirus cs is 5-ucaacu-3 and partially resembles the infectious bronchitis virus ibv cs van marle et al 1999 mutational analysis in a di system found that the sequence flanking the cs-b affected the efficiency of subgenomic di rna transcription and that cs-b was necessary but not sufficient for the synthesis of the subgenomic di rna makino et al 1991 further analysis of mhv subgenomic mrna transcription revealed that the 5 leader sequence of mhv serves as a cis-acting element required for the transcription of subgenomic mrnas liao and lai 1994 analysis of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev mrna synthesis in a minigenome system showed that the cs is essential for mediating a 100- to 1000-fold increase in mrna synthesis alonso et al 2002 however the cs flanking sequences also influenced transcription levels the functional importance of the trs-l and trs-b in the synthesis of subgenomic mrna was shown by a mutagenesis study in equine arteritis virus eav a member of the related arterivirus genus utilizing a reverse genetic system van marle et al 1999 mutagenesis of the rna 7 trs-b significantly reduced its transcription in contrast mutagenesis of trs-l affected all subgenomic mrna transcription and compensatory mutations in both trs-l and rna7 trs-b restored rna 7 transcription this evidence strongly supports the mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand transcription an additional comprehensive covariation mutagenesis study of several eav trss demonstrated that discontinuous rna synthesis depends not only on base-pairing between sense trs-l and antisense trs-b but also upon the primary sequence of the trs-b pasternak et al 2001 while the trs-l merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer the trs-b fulfills multiple functions the sequences of mrna leader-body junctions of trs mutants strongly suggested the discontinuous step occurs during minus-strand synthesis the development of reverse genetic systems for several coronaviruses has allowed a similar molecular genetic approach to investigating the role of the coronavirus trs rather than using di replicons for tgev analysis of the role of trs demonstrated that the canonical cs-b was not absolutely required for the generation of subgenomic mrnas but its presence led to transcription levels at least 1000-fold higher than those in its absence zuniga et al 2004 a recent study in sars-cov rewired the trs circuit yount et al 2006 recombinant genomes were constructed that contained mixtures of the wild-type and mutant regulatory trs viable viruses were isolated from wild-type and recombinant genomes containing homogeneous transcription circuits chimeras that contained mixed regulatory networks were invariantly lethal in the lethal mutants the mixed trs circuits promoted inefficient subgenomic transcription from inappropriate start sites resulting in truncated open reading frames orfs and minimized viral structural protein expression yount et al 2006 this experiment provides further evidence for the discontinuous synthesis of minus-strand rnas and the key role of trs-l and trs-b sequences in regulating subgenomic rna synthesis in tgev there is a good correlation between subgenomic mrna levels and the free energy of trs-l and trs-b duplex formation except for subgenomic mrna n sola et al 2005 leading the enjuanes laboratory to seek additional regulatory sequences recently a 9-nt transcriptional enhancer sequence was demonstrated 449 nts upstream of the tgev n gene trs core sequence cs-n moreno et al 2008 this enhancer sequence interacts with a complementary sequence just upstream of cs-n specifically increasing the accumulation of subgenomic mrna n this interaction is exclusively conserved in group 1a coronaviruses 5 cis-acting elements have been defined for several coronaviruses using di deletion mapping analysis dalton et al 2001 chang et al 1994 izeta et al 1999 a series of studies with mhv dis demonstrated that as little as 466 nts at the 5 terminus were needed for di rna replication kim et al 1993 kim and makino 1995 luytjes et al 1996 similar analyses with a bcov synthetic di rna indicated that only the 5 498 nts were needed for di rna replication currently no sars-cov 5 cis-acting elements have been defined by a deletion analysis the di rna deletion analyses cited above defined the minimal cis-acting elements required for di replication without further dissecting these sequences chang et al 1994 demonstrated that the bcov 68 nt leader is a necessary part of the 498 nt cis-acting signal for di rna replication rna higher-order structures contained in group 2 coronaviruses 5 utr were first predicted for bcov using the mfold algorithm chang et al 1994 subsequently enzymatic probing and functional mutational analysis chang et al 1996 raman et al 2003 raman and brian 2005 defined four stem-loops denoted i ii iii and iv within the first 210 nts of bcov the predicted stem-loop i nts 1142 contains three contiguous wastoncrick base-pairs and a large 16 nt loop and is not conserved among group 2 coronaviruses chang et al 1994 the predicted stem-loop ii nts 5184 is a au base-pair-rich hairpin with a low free energy that folds the trs into the terminal loop a poorly conserved stem-loop ii homolog has been predicted in other coronaviruses and in eav van der born et al 2004 raman and brian 2005 stem-loop iii nts 97116 is phylogenetically conserved and appears to have homologs in coronavirus groups 1 and 3 enzymatic probing and mutational analysis in di rna replication assays supports its existence raman et al 2003 stem-loop iv nts 186215 a bulged stem-loop is also conserved amongst group 2 coronaviruses and may have a homolog in group 1 and 3 however the predicted stem-loop iv homolog in sars-cov appears to be group 1-like raman and brian 2005 stem-loop iv exists as a higher-order structure based on enzymatic probing and it is required for di rna replication recently two stem-loops slv nts 239310 and slvi nts 311340 extending into the nsp1 coding region were demonstrated by rnase structure probing and sequence covariation among closely related group 2 coronaviruses slvi is required for di rna replication brown et al 2007 the recent establishment of reverse genetic systems for coronaviruses representing all of the coronavirus subgroups has facilitated the functional analysis of cis-acting elements in the context of the whole genome recently we proposed a consensus secondary structural model of the 5 140 nts of the 5 utr based on nine representative coronaviruses including sars-cov from all three coronavirus groups kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 the 5 140 nts of the nine coronaviruses genomes were predicted to fold into three major stem-loops denoted sl1 sl2 and sl4 see fig 41 some sequences were predicted to contain a fourth stem-loop sl3 which folds the trs-l into a hairpin loop sl1 sl2 and sl4 were structurally conserved amongst all coronaviruses examined sl3 is only predicted to be stable for human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 and sars-cov it should be noted that sl1 and sl2 differ from the structures studied in bcov pdrep 1 rna by the brian group chang et al 1996 raman et al 2003 raman and brian 2005 however sliii in brians model is almost identical with our sl4b liu et al 2007 raman et al 2003
 although the full mhv and sars-cov 5 utrs are significantly different in terms of sequences and predicted secondary structures the sars-cov sl1 sl2 and sl4 can functionally replace their mhv counterparts in the mhv genome and produce viable chimeric viruses kang et al 2006 however mhv chimeras containing the complete sars-cov 5 utr or the sars-cov sl3 were not viable replacing the sars-cov trs with the mhv trs in the mhv5 utr sars-cov chimera permitted the synthesis of minus-strand genomic rna but did not support the production of positive- or minus-strand subgenomic rna7 this study supports the idea that sl1 sl2 and sl4 are conserved and interchangeable within the same group without affecting viral viability a detailed mutational and biophysical study of mhv sl1 revealed that this stem-loop is functionally and structurally bipartite sl1 contains one or more noncanonical base-pairs in the central portion of the stem in mhv two pyrimidinepyrimidine base-pairs are present in the middle of sl1 as demonstrated by nmr studies liu et al 2007 these noncanonical base-pairs divide the sl1 helical stem into upper and lower segments the upper region of sl1 is required to be base-paired mutations that disrupted base-pairing of this region were not viable or severely impaired li et al 2008 combining both sets of mutations in the upper region of sl1 restored the base-pairing and yielded a viable virus comparable to the wild-type virus in its growth phenotype in contrast mutations in the lower region of sl1 that destroyed base-pairing were viable and genomes with compensatory mutations predicted to restore base-pairing were nonviable deletion of a bulged or extruded a in the lower portion of the stem mutation a35 a mutation that increased the thermal stability of the lower portion of the sl1 helix was strongly selected against a35-containing viruses were rapidly replaced by viruses containing destabilizing second-site mutations near a35 additionally mutations that increased the stability of the lower portion of sl1 were lethal suggesting that structural lability in the lower portion of the sl1 stem was required thermal denaturation and imino proton exchange experiments further demonstrated that the lower half of sl1 is unstable sl1 second-site mutants also contained an additional second-site mutation a29g or a78g in their 3 utr providing genetic evidence for an interaction between the 5 and 3 utrs thus we hypothesized that the base of sl1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5 utr and the 3 utr li et al 2008 these data plus the observed defects in subgenomic rna synthesis in our nonviable sl1 mutants are consistent with the genome circularization model for coronavirus transcription put forward by zuniga et al 2004 and suggest that replication complexes and transcription complexes have different structural requirements in the 5 utr sl2 is the most conserved secondary structure in the 5 utrs of all coronaviruses examined liu et al 2007 except for the core trs leader sequence the cuuuguc sequence encompassing the predicted sl2 loop is the most conserved contiguous run of nucleotides in the entire 5 utr and contains features of a canonical u-turn motif in which the middle 3 nts of the loop unr u0n1r2 form a triloop that stacks on a yy ya or ga noncanonical base-pair the basic structural feature of the canonical u-turn is a sharp turn in the phosphate backbone between u0 and n1 with u0 engaged in two critical hydrogen bonds the u0 imino proton donates a hydrogen bond to the nonbridging phosphate oxygen following r2 and the u0 2-oh proton donates a hydrogen bond to the n7 of r2 nmr studies of sl2 indicated that the u0 imino proton donates a hydrogen bond in sl2 consistent with a u-turn structure however there was no evidence for the predicted noncanonical pyrimidinepyrimidine base-pair between positions 47 and 51 additional nmr studies indicate that u51 was extruded from the loop and that the watsoncrick faces of c47 and g50 were in apposition li and giedroc unpublished formation of the stem was required for virus viability although the sequence of the stem was unimportant liu et al 2007 replacing u48 with either cytosine or adenosine was lethal consistent with a unr loop structure for sl2 liu et al 2007 however viruses containing a u48g mutation were viable and replicated almost as well as wild-type virus nmr studies indicated that a guanine at position 48 engaged in a hydrogen bond similar to that observed for u48 mutagenesis of u49 and u51 demonstrated that any nucleotide can function in these positions whereas the g at position 50 is required liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009 rt-pcr analyses of cells electroporated with genomes containing lethal mutations in sl2 demonstrate that sl2 is required for subgenomic rna synthesis as was sl1 taken together the functional and structural data suggests that sl2 more closely resembles a ynmg-like tetraloop than a u-turn additional nmr studies should provide an atomic resolution structure to determine the preise geometry of the loop experiments to dissect the cis-acting elements in the coronavirus 3 utr have generated a comprehensive view of cis-acting elements in this region initial di deletion analyses found that the minimal 3 terminus sequence required to support mhv di rna replication is 436 nts a region containing part of the upstream n gene and the entire 301 nt 3 utr lin and lai 1993 luytjes et al 1996 for tgev and ibv the minimal sequence requirements were 492 nts and 338 nts respectively and did not include any part of the n gene mendez et al 1996 dalton et al 2001 it was later confirmed this was also true for mhv as a recombinant virus containing the n gene translocated into an upstream genomic position was viable goebel et al 2004a for mhv the differing conclusions resulting from di assays and intact virus may reflect the fact that di assays are inherently competition assays with wild-type genomes and thus may be more sensitive at detecting minor decreases in relative fitness then assays with infectious viruses that focus on recovering viable viruses this was clearly true in experiments in which di rnas carrying mutations at the 3 end failed to replicate at detectable levels but recombinant viruses with these same mutations were viable with only modestly impaired replication phenotypes johnson et al 2005 a deletion analysis utilizing a di rna replicon defined the minimum sequence needed for minus-strand rna synthesis as the 3-most 55 nts plus the polya tail lin et al 1994 spangnolo and hogue demonstrated that the polya tail was required for di replication although as little as five as would suffice to initiate replication spagnolo and hogue 2000 genetic and enzymatic probing of mhv and bcov 3 utr secondary structure demonstrated the presence of three rna secondary structures fig 41 hsue and masters 1997 the 5-most of these a 68 nt bulged stem-loop immediately downstream of the n gene stop codon was predicted to be absolutely conserved in mhv bcov hcov-oc43 and bovine enteric coronavirus this stem-loop was further characterized biochemically and mutagenesis demonstrated that it was essential for di rna and for viral replication hsue et al 2000 a 54 nt hairpin-type pseudoknot 3 to the 68 nt bulged stem-loop was first found to be required for di rna replication in the 3 utr of bcov williams et al 1999 this pseudoknot is phylogenetically conserved among coronaviruses including the sars-cov goebel et al 2004b both in location and in shape but only partially in nucleotide sequence in a later study with mhv goebel et al 2004a this pseudoknot was demonstrated to partially overlap with the bulged stem-loop such that the last part of the bulged stem-loop overlaps with stem 1 of the pseudoknot thus these two structures cannot be formed simultaneously this finding led to the proposal that the bulged stem-loop and the pseudoknot are components of a molecular switch that regulate viral rna synthesis goebel et al 2004a the third rna secondary structure a complex multiple stem-loop structure is further downstream in the mhv 3 utr this structure was predicted by computer-assisted analysis of the last 166 nts of the genome 3 to the pseudoknot using the mfold algorithm liu et al 2001 enzymatic probing of rna secondary structure supported the existence of the predicted long bulged stem-loop encompassing nts 14368 and with a second stem-loop from nts 67 to 52 within the long stem-loop a conserved bulged-stem structure nts 142132 and nts 7968 also present in bcov was identified by covariation analysis site-directed mutagenesis and di rna replication assays indicated that the long bulged-stem loop between nts 143 and 68 plays an important role in di rna replication similar assays to examine the shorter stem-loop between nts 67 and 52 failed to provide evidence for a role in di replication liu et al 2001 the long bulged stem-loop contains an octanucleotide sequence 5-ggaagagc-3 nts 8174 in mhv that is conserved in the 3 utr of coronaviruses from all three groups and thus might have important biological functions further analysis of the long bulged stem-loop revealed that although the octanucleotide sequence is almost universally conserved in coronaviruses the remainder of this complex stem-loop resides in a hypervariable region hvr of the 3 utr that is poorly conserved in group 2 coronaviruses an extensive mutational analysis of the hvr was carried out by deletion rearrangements and point mutations goebel et al 2007 all these mutations have only modest effects on viral replication indicating that the hvr is not essential for viral rna synthesis this result differs from the results obtained in di systems by liu et al 2001 and by lin et al 1994 since the most extensive hvr mutant deleted nts 30170 it is clear that not all 55 nts are required for minus-strand replication a possible explanation for these discrepancies is the inherent competitive nature of di replication assays greatly increasing the effects of mutations that are only moderately deleterious in the context of the intact genome the hvr deletion mutant was highly attenuated in mice suggesting that the hvr might play a significant role in viral pathogenesis goebel et al 2007 however it should be kept in mind that the hvr deletion virus grew to a titer 23-fold less than that of wild-type virus in cell culture making the interpretation of its effect on pathogenesis difficult most recently multiple second-site revertants of the pseudoknot were recovered by characterizing an unstable mutant alb391 with a 6 nt insertion of aacaag in loop 1 of the pseudoknot of mhv 3 utr these second-site suppressor mutations were localized to two separate regions of the genome one group of mutations was mapped to nsp8 and nsp9 and the second group mapped to the extreme 3 end of the genome these observations led the authors to point out that coronavirus replicase gene products might interact with the 3 end of the genome and that the loop 1 of the pseudoknot has the potential to base-pair with the extreme end of the genome zust et al 2008 this observation is supported by structural predictions phylogenetic conservation of the interaction amongst all known group 2 coronaviruses and the ability of a drastically minimized truncation mutant hvr3 in which all sequences between nts 29 and 171 were replaced by a tetraloop capping the helix downstream of pseudoknot stem 2 zust et al 2008 however this base-pairing interaction has not yet been demonstrated biochemically or by mutagenesis interestingly the 3 utr stem-loop structures of the group 2 coronaviruses seem to be different from both group 1 and group 3 coronaviruses all the group 1 coronaviruses contain a highly conserved pseudoknot williams et al 1999 but there is no bulged stem-loop structure in the 3 utr the group 3 coronaviruses have a highly conserved and functionally essential stem-loop dalton et al 2001 but only a poor candidate for the pseudoknot structure can be found nearby williams et al 1999 only the group 2 coronaviruses have both the pseudoknot and the bulged stem-loop in close proximity and they all overlap in the same fashion despite their primary sequence divergence among the 3 utrs of group 2 coronaviruses the secondary structures are all highly conserved and functionally equivalent as shown by the replication of a bcov di rna in the presence of various group 2 helper viruses wu et al 2003 and by the isolation of chimeras in which the 3 utrs of bcov and sars-cov both group 2 coronaviruses replaced their mhv counterpart without affecting viral viability hsue and masters 1997 goebel et al 2004b however the mhv 3 utr cannot be replaced with either the group 1 tgev 3 utr or the group 3 ibv 3 utr hsue and masters 1997 goebel et al 2004b although exactly how a coronavirus synthesizes its rnas is still unclear there is increasing evidence that coronavirus discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic mrnas is directed by cis-acting sequences present on the viral rnas with the help of trans-acting factors encoded by the virus as well as cellular proteins although it has been demonstrated that continuous protein synthesis is required for viral rna synthesis sawicki and sawicki 1986 little is known as to which viral and cellular proteins are involved in viral rna transcription and replication the current discontinuous rna synthesis model proposes that the trs-l sequence is brought into close proximity to sequences located at the 3 end of the genomic rna through rnarna or rnaprotein and proteinprotein interactions indeed several cellular proteins have been shown to interact with the 5 and 3 ends of the coronavirus genome see fig 41 at the 3 end of the coronavirus genome the 73 kda cytoplasmic polya binding protein pabp binds to the polya tail spagnolo and hogue 2000 a series of host proteins were found to bind to the mhv 3-most 42 nt rna probe using rnase protectiongel mobility shift and uv cross-linking assays yu and leibowitz 1995a 1995b further analysis revealed that these proteins include mitochondrial aconitase and the chaperones mitochondrial hsp70 hsp60 and hsp40 nanda et al 2004 nanda and leibowitz 2001 di replication assays suggested that proteins binding to both the polya tail and the last 42 nts of the mhv genome had a role in replication mutations in the 342 host protein binding element had a deleterious effect on the accumulation of di rna and when the same mutations were introduced into the mhv genome one mutant was found to be nonviable this mutant had a defect in subgenomic mrna synthesis which points to a potential role for sequences at the extreme 3 end of the mhv genome in subgenomic rna synthesis johnson et al 2005 a finding consistent with the model proposed by the enjuanes group zuniga et al 2004 polypyrimidine tract-binding ptb protein was shown to bind to two regions of the mhv 3 utr a strong ptb binding site was mapped to nts 53149 and another weak binding site was mapped to nts 270307 on the complementary strand of the 3 utr huang and lai 1999 since a number of these binding sites are deleted in the replication competent hvr mutant virus discussed above it is unlikely that most of these proteins are required for viral replication goebel et al 2007 the viral protein n binds to the trs-l specifically and with high affinity nelson et al 2000 it has been suggested that n protein binding to trs-l favors translation of viral rnas tahara et al 1998 and may also play a role in mhv rna synthesis li et al 1999 recently bcov nsp1 was shown to bind three 5 utr and one 3 utr-located cis-replication stem-loops and may function to regulate viral genome translation or replication gustin et al 2009 another cellular protein the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnrnp a1 was demonstrated to bind to the mhv minus-strand leader and trs-b complementary sequences through immunoprecipitation after uv cross-linking and by in vitro binding assays with recombinant protein li et al 1997 hnrnp a1 was shown to have two binding sites at the mhv 3 end and these binding sites are complementary to the sites on the minus-strand rna that bind ptb huang and lai 2001 mutations that affect ptb binding to the negative strand of the 3 utr also inhibited hnrnp a1 binding on the positive strand indicating a possible relationship between these two proteins furthermore both hnrnp a1 and ptb bind to the complementary strands at the 5 end of mhv rna based on these observations it was proposed that hnrnp a1ptb interactions provide a molecular mechanism for potential 53 cross-talk in mhv rna which may be important for rna replication and transcription however the role of hnrnp a1 in viral replication is controversial paul masters group shen and masters 2001 tested the role of hnrnp a1 in viral transcription and replication by inserting a high-affinity hnrnp a1 binding site in place of or adjacent to an intergenic sequence in the mhv genome this inserted hnrnp a1 binding site was not able to functionally replace or enhance transcription from the intergenic sequence additionally mhv was able to replicate normally and synthesize normal levels of genome and subgenomic rnas in cells lacking hnrnp a1 suggesting that hnrnp a1 is not required for mhv discontinuous transcription or genome replication however it was subsequently shown that other members of the hnrnp family can substitute for hnrnap a1 choi et al 2004 a recent study also showed that a cytoplasmic host factor is indispensable for sars-cov in vitro rna synthesis although this host factor has not yet been identified van hemert et al 2008 how these and other potential cellular proteins interact with the coronavirus 5 and 3 cis-acting elements to initiate and support genomic and subgenomic rna synthesis is a long unanswered interesting question there is a paucity of data demonstrating viral proteins binding to specific cis-acting sequences in the coronavirus genome with the exception of the n protein to trs-l discussed above although there is genetic evidence for nsp8 and nsp9 interacting with the 3 utr zust et al 2008 there is no data defining precisely where these proteins bind nor is there any evidence as to how any other replicase components bind to the genome we anticipate that research over the next few years will answer these questions and clarify how the various virus and host proteins function in viral replication  comparative full-length genome sequence analysis of 14 sars coronavirus isolates and common mutations

a new coronavirus2 3 oropharyngeal specimens from patients with sars induced a cytopathic effect on vero e6 tissue culture cells and revealed the presence of coronavirus-like particles reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis with random or broadly-specific coronavirus primers amplified a dna fragment that resembled but was distinct from known coronavirus genomes when tested these diagnostic pcr methods detected the sars virus in many clinical samples taken from affected patients in addition serological evidence has shown the presence of antibodies specific to the new coronavirus in the serum of patients with sars4 collectively these data strongly implicate the new coronavirus as the cause of sars which we designate as sars-cov sars-cov is a member of the coronoviridae family of enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses which have a broad host range some coronavirus infections in people cattle and birds cause respiratory disease whereas other coronavirus infections in rodents cats pigs and cattle lead to enteric disease the 2732 kb genomes of coronaviruses the largest of rna viruses encode 23 putative proteins including four major structural proteins nucleocapsid n spike s membrane m and small envelope e the spike protein a glycoprotein projection on the viral surface is crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell in addition variations of s protein among strains of coronavirus are responsible for host range and tissue tropism5 differences in virulence of mice coronaviruses have also been linked to genetic variance in the s protein6 7 and the serological response in the host is typically raised against the s protein8 however the s m and n mature proteins all contribute to generating the host immune response as seen in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus9 infectious bronchitis virus10 11 pig respiratory coronavirus12 and mouse hepatitis virus13
 a characteristic of rna viruses is the high rate of genetic mutation which leads to evolution of new viral strains and is a mechanism by which viruses escape host defenses therefore from a public-health perspective understanding the mutation rate of the sars virus as it spreads through the population is important moreover the genetic mutability of sars-cov especially in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins would also have an effect on development of broadly effective vaccines we aimed to determine the complete genome sequence for five sars-cov related isolates from a single sars index case three associated primary contact cases and one secondary contact and compare them with nine other sars-cov isolates available in public-domain databases we obtained five positive isolates for coronavirus from the index patient of the outbreak sin2500 three primary contacts of this patient sin2774 sin2748 sin2677 and one secondary contact sin2679 who was related to the index patient but contracted sars from another primary contact not included in this study all patients fitted the who case definition for probable sars14 fever of 38c or higher respiratory symptoms eg cough shortness of breath difficulty in breathing hypoxia and chest radiograph changes suggestive of pneumonia and history of close contact with another patient with sars or travel to a region with documented community transmission of sars within 10 days of onset of symptoms the index patient had a history of travel to hong kong and had stayed in hotel m15 the viral sources were all from respiratory samples two endotracheal tube aspirates two nasopharyngeal aspirates and one throat swab obtained from the patients between 0 and 11 days after of onset of symptoms in the analysis of the common sequence variations the probability of co-occurrence of multiple polymorphisms or mutations in an isolate was used as a measure of significance we used 13 of the samples we excluded sample bj04 because of substantial missing sequence information and restricted our attention to 26 140 loci at which nucleotides were determined in all 13 samples the null hypothesis was that the nucleotides at these loci were obtained by mutating a single consensus sequence independently at random at each position of each sequence the mutation rate was estimated from the data by the fraction of positions in the various genomes that differed from the consensus sequence obtained by taking the most frequent nucleotide at each position we also tested a weaker null hypothesis in which the mutations taking place at any given locus in different samples are independent but arbitrary dependence between the loci is possible subject to this constraint details of the analytical approach are described in webappendix 1 httpimagethelancetcomextras03art4454webappendix1pdf and on our website httpwwwgisastaredusghomepagetoolssupjsp phylogenetic analysis of the sars viral genomes was done with paup

20 with the maximum probability criterion we used the default variable settings with one exception the substitution rates were estimated from the data a separate phylogenetic analysis done with clustalw18 gave the same structure the sponsor of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or in the writing of the report we have sequenced the complete genomes of sars-cov from five singapore isolates derived from one index case sin2500 three primary cases sin2677 sin2748 and sin2774 and one secondary case sin2679 these sequences showed that the genomes of sars-cov isolated in singapore are comprised of 29 711 bases with the exception of a five-nucleotide deletion in strain sin2748 and a six-nucleotide deletion in sin2677 initial blast analysis suggested that the singapore sars virus is similar to but distinct from the group 2 coronaviruses in the coronaviridae family of enveloped and positive-stranded rna viruses as in the recently sequenced sars-cov hku39849 cuhk-w1 tor2 and urbani the singapore sars virus contains 11 predicted open reading frames that encode 23 putative mature proteins with known and unknown functions most of the non-structural proteins seem to be encoded in the first half of the genome including nsp 1 and nsp2 with putative proteinase function and nsp9 rna-dependent rna polymerase whereas most of the structural proteins such as spike membrane envelop and nucleocapsid are located in the second half of the genome figure 1
 webfigure httpimagethelancetcomextras03art4454webfigurepdf the haemagglutinin esterase which is common in the group 2 coronavirus is missing in the sars-cov genome suggesting that some of the non-structural genes are dispensable in coronaviruses although the genome organisation of sars-cov is similar to that of other coronaviruses sars-cov is only distantly related to any coronavirus member irrespective of species specificity at both nucleotide and aminoacid levels figure 2
 in assessing the homology with coronaviridae genomes from other species with the sars-cov sequence conservation seems to be restricted to the middle part of the genome between bases 14 000 and 21 000 where the rna-dependent polymerase and several uncharacterised proteins eg orf1abnsp 1013 are located the remainder of the genome especially at the 5and 3regions diverges from other strains at the nucleotide and aminoacid level we aligned the five complete genome sequences of singapore sars-cov isolates and the nine sars-cov genomes from outside of singapore which were sequenced by others and investigated the genetic variations between these 14 genomes webappendix 1 in total there were 127 single nucleotide sequence variations one deletion of six nucleotides nt 2778227787 in strain sin2677 and one deletion of five nucleotides nt 2781027814 in strain sin2748 webappendix 2 httpimagethelancetcomextras03art4454webappendix2pdf both these deletion sites were in the noncoding sequences between an uncharacterised open reading frame and the nucleocapsid protein of the 127 base substitutions 94 changed the aminoacid sequence webappendix 2 the mutations were in the following open reading frames orf1 a polyprotein orf1a rna-polymerase orf1ab nsp 10 to nsp 13 spike glycoprotein membrane nucleocapsid and several uncharacterised putative proteins to eliminate mutational noise induced in culture from real strain differences we reanalysed the data using a probabilistic approach mutations that might have been artifacts of cell culture would occur only once in our survey whereas sequence variants associated with common ancestry should be seen in multiple isolates of the 127 sequence variations in the 14 isolates 16 variant loci were identified in two or more isolates and eight were seen in three or more isolates figure 3
 with the more stringent criterion four loci recurred five or more times in the 14 sars-covs analysed ct polymorphisms at position 9404 resulting in a valine to alanine change in orf1 a nsp 1 position 19 084 leading to an isoleucine to threonine change in orf1ab nsp 11 position 22 222 changing an isoleucine residue to threonine in the s 1 portion of the spike protein and position 27 827 which is in a non-coding region figure 3 in addition a tg polymorphism is noted at position 17 564 changing orf1ab nsp 10 helicase domain from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid sequence variants at these four loci segregate together as a specific genotype for example isolates cuhkw1 gzdi bj01 bj02 bj03 bj04 all have the configuration cgcc at those nucleotide positions whereas isolates sin2500 sin2774 sin2679 sin2677 tor2 urbani hku39849 have the configuration tttt figure 3 assuming that all base substitutions were random events propagated in the vero cells the probability of four specific nucleotide changes occurring concurrently is very low the significance is at p1060 when the null hypothesis is that each locus in each sample mutates independently and p1015 when dependence is allowed among the loci the cgcc and tttt genotypes are therefore very unlikely to have emerged by chance and might be evidence for the first genetic signature of strain differences in the sars virus all isolates with the tttt genotype were linked to infection acquired at the hotel m in hong kong18 whereas none of the cgcc genotype isolates had this association figure 3 phylogenetic analysis based on the common variant sequences defined as present in two or more isolates confirmed that the cases associated with exposure in the hotel m formed a cluster that was distinct from the other isolates figure 4
 on the basis of the molecular and contact history we have reconstructed a probable lineage map of the sars-cov infections investigated here figure 5
 in addition to this four-locus genotype four other common variant sequences all occurring three to four times in the 14 isolates seem to further define subgroups geographically figure 3 the variant sequences at position 19 084 seem to distinguish the singaporean isolates from all others although all nine isolates from outside singapore showed a c at this position four of the five isolates from singapore had a t the only reversion from t to a c in sin2679 a secondary contact case might be the result of a backmutational event potentially occurring during the passage of the virus taking into account missing data the polymorphisms at nucleotide positions 9854 19 838 and 27 243 all segregate with isolates identified specifically in beijing thus these common sequence polymorphisms might be useful in identifying the differential source of a sars viral infection although the genome organisation of sars-cov is similar to that of other coronaviruses the sars-cov sequence is only distantly related to any coronavirus member results of earlier reports4 suggested that sars cov more closely resembled the cow coronavirus and the mouse hepatitis virus by comparing a conserved 215 aminoacid segment of the polymerase protein product however when taking into account the entire genomic sequence the strength of the associations was reduced confirming the reports of others that the sars coronavirus is a completely new pathogenic strain that does not arise from a simple recombination of known existing strains2 21
 since the s1 subunit of the spike protein is the major antigenic moiety for coronaviruses and is not an essential structural protein it is prone to high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations that the s1 region did not seem to have excessive numbers of base substitutions suggests that the viral isolates have not been subject to immunological selection22 23 however because all samples were from viral cultures propagated in vero cells some if not most of these 129 mutations might have occurred during in-vitro expansion and not because of host pressures24 in addition some of the available nucleotide substitutions might have been the result of sequencing errors since several of the sequences were submitted in draft form to reduce the effects of these technical artifacts we restricted our analysis to the 16 loci with recurrent mutations among the 14 isolates these loci are the sequence variants most likely to have been resident in human populations of special interest are the nucleotide changes in four of these loci positions 9404 19 084 22 222 and 27 827 that recurred five or more times the base substitutions at these locations are highly restricted and segregate together as specific genotypes cgcc vs tttt thus it is highly unlikely that the cgcc and tttt genotypes emerged by chance rather we believe this to be evidence for the first genetic signature of strain differences in the sars virus all isolates with the tttt genotype were linked to infection acquired at the hotel m in hong kong15 whereas none of the cgcc genotype isolates had this association the index case from singapore from which the singaporean infections described herein were derived acquired the sars-cov infection while staying at hotel m the tor2 virus cultured in canada and the hku39849 isolate from hong kong were from patients who became infected through contact at hotel m although perhaps not directly the urbani sars cov isolate was from a physician infected by a patient who contracted sars while staying at hotel m isolates cuhkw1 gzd1 bj01 bj02 bj03 bj04 however came from patients with no known linkage with hotel m and on the whole were derived later than the hotel m linked set our results showed that the cases associated with exposure in the hotel m formed a cluster that was distinct from the other isolates in addition to this four locus genotype the variant sequences at position 19 084 distinguished the singaporean isolates from all others there also seems to be a signature for the north china isolates at positions 9854 19838 and 27243 thus the common sequence polymorphisms might be useful in identifying the differential source of a sars viral infection whether any of these common polymorphisms will result in biological and clinical differences remains to be determined however the common mutation in position 22 222 changing an isoleucine residue to threonine in the important antigenic region of the spike protein might be relevant mutations in this region of the sars-cov genome can arise because of selective pressure from host immune responses that an isoleucine is present in all hotel m linked isolates whereas a threonine at the same position in the major antigenic protein is found in all other geographically distinct isolates suggests that such non-conservative aminoacid changes have occurred to evade immunological pressures the sars viral epidemic has placed a substantial strain on the health and economic status of nations understanding the nature of this virus and deriving methods to control the epidemic are very important our results show several molecular facets of the sars coronavirus pertinent to public-health management of this epidemic its novelty as a human pathogen suggests that most populations might be immunologically naive to its infection the discovery of genotypes linked to geographic and temporal clusters of infectious contacts suggests that molecular signatures can be used to refine contact

sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov is a fatal disease prevention of future outbreaks is essential and requires understanding pathogenesis and evolution of the virus we have isolated a sars-cov in china and analyzed 47 sars-cov genomes with the aims to reveal the evolution trends of the virus and provide insights into understanding pathogenesis and sars epidemic specimen from a sars patient was inoculated into cell culture the presence of sars-cov was determined by rt-pcr and confirmed by electron microscopy virus was isolated followed by the determination of its genome sequences which were then analyzed by comparing with other 46 sars-cov genomes genetic mutations with potential implications to pathogenesis and the epidemic were characterized this viral genome consists of 29728 nucleotides with overall organization in agreement with that of published isolates a total of 348 positions were mutated on 47 viral genomes among them 22 had mutations in more than three genomes hot spots of nucleotide variations and unique trends of mutations were identified on the viral genomes mutation rates were different from gene to gene and were correlated well with periodical or geographic characteristics of the epidemic  in november 2002 first case of a novel infectious disease named severe acute respiratory syndrome sars suddenly appeared in southern china 1  this illness emerged and rapidly spread to different areas of asia and then other countries around the world with a high morbidity about 25 required intensive care and 96 fatality 2  in march 2003 the world health organization who made an unprecedented international effort by organizing world-leading laboratories to find the causative agent this effort resulted in the declaration made simultaneously by three research groups that a new sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov was the pathogen of this disease 3 4 5  when the outbreak of sars came to an end in july 2003 it had caused a cumulative total of 8437 cases and 813 deaths worldwide 6  since the discovery of sars-cov progresses regarding the studies of this virus have been swift dramatically as the complete viral genome was sequenced 7  although the definition of sars case still largely relied on clinical and epidemiological criteria diagnostic tests based on the detection of viral rna and proteins have been developed 8  along with the development of vaccines 9  results from both phylogenetic analysis and epidemiological studies suggested the origin of sars-cov was animal-oriented most likely from himalayan palm civets ferrets and raccoon dogs 10 11 12 13  as a member of the coronoviridae family sars-cov is enveloped and positive-stranded rna virus it harbors 23 coding sequences including 4 primary structural proteins nucleocapsid protein n spike protein s membrane protein m and small envelope protein e 5 non-structural proteins x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 and 1 polyprotein that compose two orfs orf1a and orf1b polyprotein catalytically auto-processes to produce a group of proteins including proteases plppro and 3clpro rnadependent polymerase pol rna helicase hel and function unknown proteins 4 5 7  like other rna viruses whose most striking characteristic is the high rate of genetic mutation 11 14 15 16 17 18  despite the fact that the sars-cov can cause an atypical and fatal form of pneumonia the genome structure gene expression pattern and protein profiles of the virus are similar to those of other conventional coronaviruses 17  which are only responsible for mild respiratory tract infections in a wide range of animals including humans pigs cows mice cats and birds 10 19  it is possible that distinct patterns of several genes and unique variations in the sars-cov genome may contribute to its severe virulence or pathogenesis the mechanism of sars-cov pathogenesis may involve both direct viral cytocidal effects on the target cells and immunemediated mechanisms potential mutability of the viral genome may pose problems in the control of future sars epidemics in this report we described the isolation of a new sars-cov strain whu from a patient in hubei province china during the late period of sars outbreak complete genome sequence of whu isolate was determined and compared with that of 46 other sars-cov strains whose complete genomic sequences were available at the time analyzed comparative study of genetic characterization and nucleotide variation of all known sars-cov offers insights into understanding functions of the viral genes and revealing the evolution trends of the virus it would also provide basis for clinical diagnosis future developing potential drugs and vaccines against sars-cov infections the sars patient was an 18-year-old male from jiayu county hubei province china he worked in beijing during that time when sars outbreak was occurring he came back to hubei province and became ill on april 29th 2003 with fever and atypical pneumonia and was admitted to hospital for isolation and treatment on may 3rd 2003 veroe6 cells were inoculated with specimen obtained from the sars patient the presence of the sars-associated coronavirus in infected cell cultures was determined by the appearance of cytopathic effects cpe as well as by rt-pcr amplification using primers primer-1primer-2 and primer-3primer-4 table 1  specific to the sars-cov viral particles were examined under electron microscope viral rna was extracted from infected veroe6 cells based on the procedures described by the manufacture invitrogen carlsbad ca the first strand of the viral cdna was synthesized from extracted viral rna by reverse transcription pcr using random primers provided by the manufacture promega madison wi double-stranded dna fragments were produced by pcr amplification of the viral cdna using 10 pairs of specific primers primer 5 to primer 24 table 1  designed to cover entire viral genome based on the sequences of sars-cov strain hku-39849 accession number ay278491 each of the pcr products was cloned into vector pgem-t respectively random clones were selected for dna sequencing analysis sequences representing the entire viral genome was fully assembled and edited by dnasis software programs nucleotide sequences of complete genome of the sars-cov isolate whu were deposited to genbank accession number ay394850 the complete genome sequences of all 47 sars-associated coronaviruses were downloaded from genbank table 2  homology searches for the dna sequences were conducted and their deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed through the public database with the blast search program provided by the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence alignment was performed using software clustalw and further analyzed using software bioedit nucleotide sequences of the entire genome of newly identified whu strain along with that of other 46 sars-cov isolates released in the genbank were aligned with the clustalw software program phylogenetic trees were created for all nucleotide sequences by neighbor-joining and parsimony methods sequences were analyzed with reference to the trees to reveal character states relevant to phylogenetic branching during late period of the sars outbreak in 2003 three patients were identified as probable sars cases in hubei province a less sars representative area in china in order to study the sars-cov caused disease we obtained specimen from one of the patients seven days after inoculation of veroe6 cells with patient specimens cpe was appeared on the infected cells  fig 1 indicating the presence of an infectious agent two specific amplicons were detected by rt-pcr amplifications using extracted viral rna as templates when two pairs of sars-cov specific primers were used respectively data not shown these results implicated that exist of a sars-cov in the specimen was highly possible coronavirus- table 2  accession numbers of genomic sequences of 47 sarsassociated

from the patients serum all together these results provided substantial evidence to suggest that this patient was infected by sars-cov named whu strain after identification of the whu strain we isolated the virus and determined complete nucleotide sequences of its genome accession numberay394850 since this virus was the only sars-cov that has ever been isolated and sequenced from hubei province we carried out detailed sequence analysis of its entire genome results from sequence analysis indicated that the genome of whu strain consisted of 29728 nucleotides with a two-nucleotide deletion at residuals 27825 and 27826 phylogenetic analysis was conducted with the genome sequences of the whu strain and that of all 46 sars-cov isolates whose genomic sequence information was fully available in the public databases table 2  both phylogenetic study and sequence analysis indicated that the overall genome organization and predicted proteins of whu isolate were in agreement with published studies on other sars-cov isolates fig 2  like all sars-cov isolates the whu strain belongs to a new group of coronavirus 3  however the whu isolate with a two-nucleotide deletion was genetically diverse from most of the published sars-cov isolates but closely related to twc strain fig 3  to investigate the variations of nucleotide sequences among sars coronaviruses we performed a genome-wide analysis of genetic mutations on all 47 sars-cov genomes results indicated that a total of 348 positions on the 47 viral genomes had alterative nucleotides among them 22 positions with mutations occurred on more than three viral genomes  table 3  fig 4 table 3 and fig 4  our next step was to determine whether the high mutability had any implications linked to the viral genes or their functions  fig 4 and table 3  after further comparison and analysis of the viral sequences we realized that polyprotein gene orf1 a and orf1 b had the highest variation rate among all genes this region not only carried 11 mutations but also had the second highest variable positions residual 3852 and 11493 orf1b gene contains additional two residuals 17564 and 19 084 at which 7 viruses were mutated we also noticed that the s gene had a high mutability with residual 22222 mutated in 7 viruses residual 21721 in 6 and residual 24933 in 3 two positions with high mutation rate were identified within the m gene one was located at the most variable residual 26477 at which 20 viruses were mutated the other one was residual 26600 at which 6 viral genomes were changed e gene and n gene had one mutation spot at residual 26203 and 28276 respectively among five nonstructural genes x4 had one mutation site at residual 27243 with mutation rate of 5 while x5 gene had two mutation spots at residual 27813 and 27827 with mutation rate of 7  fig 4 and table 3  based on the recommendations from who 6  all sars cases can be divided periodically into early-period case mid-period case and late-period case table 4  in this study we proposed all 47 known viral isolates into two groups early-mid period and mid-late period group table 5  based on results from sequence analysis we realized that there were some correlations between genetic mutations of the virus and periodical or geographic characteristics of the outbreak several residuals 9404 9854 17564 19838 tables 3 5  in addition some genetic mutations were linked to certain geographic regions where the viruses isolated for instance high genetic mutation rate at position 3852 was mainly found in viruses isolated from taiwan mutations at residual 26203 occurred in most taiwan isolates 60 but not found in any isolates identified from other regions around the world moreover all three viral strains fra sod and frankfurt isolated from europe had mutations at the same residuals 2557 11448 and 24933 while the rest isolates showed no changes in these positions tables 3 and 5  although the sars epidemic ended after 6 months spreading many important questions remain unclear what is the natural reservoir of sars-cov where and how the virus crossed the barriers between its reservoir and human to initiate reservoir-human transmission and subsequent human-to-human infection it was proposed that the natural reservoir of sars-cov was animal originated 10 11 13  most likely himalayan palm civets 12  this was not a surprise since many fatal human viruses including hiv and influenza virus were originated by transmission from animals hiv pandemic had happened as a consequence of the combination of transmission of sivcpz from chimpanzee and common practice of hunting and field-dressing chimpanzee in west central africa 20  similarly in southern china where sars-cov initially emerged people used to consume wild animal meat and some of the animals are now confirmed to carry sars-like coronavirus 12  another question is whether sars outbreak will come back at the beginning of 2004 three sars cases were reported indicating sars do come back however the situation of this year seems quite different from last year since transmission infection and severity of sars-cov were clearly weakened one possible explanation is that it might be just a preface of sars epidemics like last year in the early period of sars pandemics the virus did not show strong toxicity another possibility is that sars-cov might be truly weakened due to many reasons including genetic mutations like the influenza flua virus which has caused a disaster outbreak in 1918 and was weakened after the pandemic that took 20 million lives 21  influenza epidemics throughout the world occurred periodically between the first pandemic and present time due to the viral antigenic drift and shift these processes also resulted in the appearance of influenza b and c virus with significant differences in genetic characterizations 22  it would be important to find out if sars-cov has similar epidemic rules as influenza virus dose whether sars-cov is weakening or will sars breakout periodically while these questions remain to be addressed it is for sure that the sars-cov certainly has a high mutation rate

could in turn play significant roles in its pathogenecity and epidemics of the disease molecular epidemiology and genome-wide analysis of mutations among sars-cov have provided insights into our understanding some of the questions 11 14 15 16 17 18  for instance except the geographic distribution of potential animal reservoirs the high homologies among sars-cov of human and sars-like coronavirus of animals strongly supported the hypothesis of animal origin of sars-cov 12  it is possible that some mutations on the viral genome were responsible for the transmission of sars-cov from animals to human in an effort to study the sars-cov we identified and genetically sequenced a new sars-cov isolated from a patient with sars in hubei province hubei was a less sars representative area in china because there were only a total of three patients confirmed as probable sars cases and only one viral strain was isolated from this region these facts prompted us to study this virus further our sequence analysis indicated that although the overall genome organization of whu fig 2  is in agreement with published studies on other isolates whu carried a two-nucleotide deletion at residuals 27825 and 27826 was genetically diverse from most sars-cov isolates these results implicated that mutations occurred during the viral transmission from beijing to hubei although we do not know at this point whether these mutations have any biological significance it is interesting to notice that although the sars-cov virus evaded human population only for 6 months its genetic information already altered in many ways during its short journey of human transmission individual viral genes displayed distinct patterns of genetic mutations at different time during the sars outbreak for instance mutability of the s gene was high during early-mid period but low during mid-late period of the epidemic which suggested that mutability of s gene decreased as viral transmission increased one possible explanation for this observation is that during early-mid period of the epidemic as the gene encoding protein for the recognition of receptors of the host and for the mediation of viral entry into host cells s gene had to change at a high frequency in order to quickly fulfill its biological roles once the viral adaptation to human cells completed or reached its equilibrium genetic changes were less important or no longer needed thus genetic information of s gene became relatively stable during mid-late period of the outbreak 23  another example is orf lab that encodes the polyprotein of sars-cov like s gene orf lab was also actively involved in genetic mutations however in contrast to s gene mutability of orf lab was low at the beginning but high during midlate period of the epidemics this observation can be explained well by the fact that the toxicity of sars-cov was weakened in mid-late period other structural genes including e m and n genes were more conserved at beginning of the outbreak but underwent genetic changes at the end of transmission this pattern of genetic mutation obviously reflects biological roles of these structural genes in viral particles assembly which in turn crucial for the virus to fight with increasing immune pressures from the hosts genetic analysis of non-structural genes showed that they intended to keep genetic information conserved throughout the entire process of transmission therefore these genes may prove to be ideal targets for the diagnosis of sars-cov screening antiviral drugs and perhaps developing antiviral vaccines patterns of genetic mutations of certain viral genes were linked to geographic locations from where the virus isolated mutations at residuals 3825 and 26203 within the x5 and e genes could clearly set the taiwan isolates apart from others thus these two positions may be used as molecular signatures in the identification of taiwan isolates similar phenomena were also found in three viral strains sod fra and frankfurt isolated from europe during mid-late period of the outbreak these viral strains had mutations at the same residuals 2557 11448 and 24933 while all isolates from other regions did not show any changes at these positions this kind of specific mutation pattern may reflect relatively independent geographical locations of taiwan and europe we speculated that population in these regions perhaps developed unique immunity due to their unique locations for which the virus had to make specific genetic mutations in order to invade these populations in addition based on genome-wide mutation analysis some viral strains isolated from beijing had a close relationship to isolates identified from southern china during early-mid period of the outbreak it could be translated to that at least these sars-cov isolates found in beijing were originally from southern china much have to be done in order to understand thoroughly the evolution transmission origin and infection of sars-associated coronavirus it is interesting to recognize that genome-wide mutation analysis could provide new insights into our understanding the route of viral transmission and predication or perhaps prevention of future sars epidemics our study would provide a rational and hypothesis-driven approach to study these questions develop rapid diagnostic tests and design measurement to prevent this fatal disease in addition fully understand molecular mechanism of genetic mutations would provide insights into understanding plausible transmission route of sars-cov from animal to humans as well as from human to human and trends of changing in pathogenecity of sars-cov during its rout of transmission and path of evolution  phylogenomics and bioinformatics of sars-cov

algorithms 2 3 the distance methods used to assess sars-cov phylogeny present several disadvantages first by converting a sequence alignment to pairwise distances we necessarily lose some of the evolutionary information contained within the analysed sequences 1 second distance methods are known to compromise the accuracy of estimates of evolutionary divergence which are fundamental to understanding the rate and mode of viral evolution third there are no known methods to test evolutionary models and estimated trees produced using the pairwise distance methodology 1 here we use state-of-the-art phylogenetic methods to analyse all the available coronaviridae and sars-cov sequence datasets to gain an insight into the origin and evolution of sars-cov and to narrow down the list of potential regions of its genome that might be interesting targets for drug design the statistically most robust method that can be used to achieve these aims is to consider the phylogenetic inference problem in a likelihood framework using a valid model of evolution for viral genomes 1 the choice of such a model for single-stranded rna virus genomes is difficult a parametric model based on chemical or biological properties of rna might underestimate or completely miss important unknown constraints for example packaging of single-stranded rna genomes that requires interaction with coat proteins 4 an alternative approach is to use empirical models that are generated through comparisons of observed sequences for example simply counting apparent replacements between closely related sequences given that sequence databases are biased towards mammalian and bacterial dna sequences there are relatively few coding single-stranded rna sequences to be aligned and non-coding rna sequences such as rrna or trna might be subjected to different selective eg structural constraints because the proteins encoded by rna genes might be subjected to functional constraints in a similar manner to non-viral proteins it might be better to use empirical amino acid substitution models that describe the probability of fixation of amino acid changes rather than rna models furthermore relative to primary structure the secondary structure of homologous proteins persists long after any statistically significant sequence similarity has vanished sequences with 25 amino acid identity probably have the same secondary structure 5 amino acid models of evolution that incorporate protein structural information perform better than simple amino acid models 6 moreover selection pressures act on protein function which in turn is closely related to structure therefore incorporating structure information into evolutionary analysis can assist in incorporating selective constraints here the programme passml-tm which implements protein secondary structure-based models of evolution has been used for analyses 7 8 the first undertaking is the determination and rooting of the coronavirus phylogeny that is the putative origin of the sequences of interest a large fraction 70 of the sars-cov genome encodes a replicase polyprotein which has significant sequence homology to all of the replicase polyproteins that have been sequenced to date from the order nidovirales comprising the coronavirus torovirus okavirus and arterivirus genera therefore this protein is a good choice for investigating the phylogenetic relationships among the family coronaviridae viral sequences have high mutation rates and consequently alignments are usually difficult to prepare here clustalw is applied using standard parameters 9 followed by careful refinement of the alignments both by eye and by using the protein secondary structural information for each nidovirus sequence as predicted by phd httpcubicbioccolumbiaedupredictprotein 10 and psi-pred httpbioinfcsuclacukpsipred 11 figure 1
shows the maximum likelihood tree produced using a set of homologous replicases from five sars-cov strains 12 other coronaviruses representing both groups 1 and 2 of the genus 2 3 one torovirus breda virus and one okavirus yellow head yh virus which were determined to most closely represent the consensus coronavirus sequence by a psi-blast search 12 the coronavirus sequences allow the determination of the root of the sars-cov strains whereas the torovirus and okavirus sequences provide insights into the rooting of the family coronaviridae phylogeny which is closer to group 1 than group 2 of the coronavirus genus as found previously by marra et al
2 and rota et al
3 the root of sars-cov is closer to coronavirus group 2 all sars-cov strains are almost completely identical in sequence 99 dna sequence homology and therefore it is not possible to get any meaningful phylogeny within the sars-cov group the avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv which causes respiratory disease in chickens and the turkey virus tcv which causes enteric disease are clustered together their ancestor divides groups 1 and 2 of the mammal-infecting coronaviruses the close clustering of the chicken and turkey viruses suggests that the difference between enteric and respiratory tropisms might require only a few amino acid changes experiments have shown that just two point mutations in the spike s glycoprotein can change porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev a mostly enteric virus that can kill piglets into a non-deadly virus that excels at the respiratory route but replicates poorly in the gut 13 14 15 to infect enteric tract cells with tgev two different domains of the s protein of tgev mapping to between amino acids 522 and 744 and close to amino acid 219 are involved 13 the first domain binds to aminopeptidase n papn many viruses use co-receptors and it is probable that the second domain maps a co-receptor essential for the enteric tropism of tgev 14 15 the clustering of murine hepatitis virus mhv and rat coronavirus rtcov might reflect the relatively close proximity in which the hosts reside and perhaps the similarity of murine and rat target receptors note that mhv receptors including ceacam1 have recently been identified 16 17 the clustering of the human oc43 hcov-oc43 bovine bcov and porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis hev coronaviruses might reflect conditions contributing to cross-infection in farming the breda torovirus is enteric whereas the yh okavirus infects gill tissue in prawns this indicates that the switch between enteric and respiratory tropism is a general characteristic of the order nidovirales coronaviruses attach to host cells through the s glycoprotein 15 18 this protein is translated as a large polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved into a receptor-binding peripheral subunit s1 that remains non-covalently associated with a fusion-inducing membrane-spanning s2 fragment 18 studies have shown that the entry of the porcine coronavirus tgev into cells is mediated by the interactions of s1 with papn an ectoenzyme abundantly expressed at the apical membrane of enterocytes covering the villi of the small intestine 19 the fact that the s protein mediates the first interaction of the virus with human cells suggests that it might represent an excellent target for effective anti-sars-cov drugs unfortunately structural information is only available for the 3clpro proteinase which is part of the coronavirus replication complex pdb accessions 1q2w 1p9u 1p9s and 1lvo 20 the s protein shows relatively high sequence homology within two of the major coronavirus groups 60 within group 1 38 within group 2 whereas the homology between groups is lower 1521 between groups 1 and 2 1521 between sars-cov and group 1 or 2 comparative sequence analysis between the sars-cov sequences and sequences from groups 1 and 2 of the coronavirus genus reveals three regions of varying sequence conservation from amino acid positions 1 to 400 401680 and 6811255 interestingly the first two regions correspond to the s1 fragment we subsequently refer to these regions as s1a and s2a and the third to the s2 fragment figure 2a
shows a cartoon of the gene for the s protein the region s1a is poorly conserved between groups 1 and 2 and sars-cov whereas s1b is flanked by two very well conserved motifs making it easier to align the internal sequences notably this region is homologous to a tgev spike region that is reported to contain determinants for tissue tropism 13 14 15 the region s2 is more conserved than s1a and s1b and consequently the alignment is easily determined passml-tm which uses the evolutionary relationships of the sequences analysed to improve its predictions of secondary structure and accessibility predicts a transmembrane helix at location 11961218 of the s protein the maximum likelihood trees of s1b and s2 are shown in figures 2b and 2c respectively the length of the trees and the distances between sequences reflect the sequence homologies according to the model of evolution explaining why the s2 tree is much shorter than s1b tree the phylogenetic tree produced from the analysis of the spike s2 fragment from several coronaviruses indicates that sars-cov is closer to group 2 of the coronavirus genus than to group 1 phylogenetic analysis of the s1 fragment from several coronaviruses indicates that sars-cov has an even closer relationship to group 2 viruses than the previous analysis suggests phylogenetic analysis of a 300 amino acid region at the terminus of s1 which we denote s1b indicates that sars-cov belongs to group 2 and is closely related to mhv and rtcov the differences between these results might be a result of recombination events involving sars-cov or convergent evolution or they might also be caused simply by chance however it is apparent that sars-cov is most closely related to group 2 of the coronavirus genus because the s1 fragment of mhv binds to ceacam1 we suggest that the s1b region of the sars-cov spike might bind to a human ceacam1 receptor instead of papn holmes and collaborators who have identified receptors for mhv murine ceacam1a hcov-229e human papn and feline coronaviruses feline papn 16 17 are currently investigating this hypothesis k holmes pers commun in support of the proposal that s1b is involved in receptor-binding is the fact that this region is homologous to a domain of the tgev s protein which is located between amino acids 522 and 744 and is also involved in receptor-binding 13 16 notably tgev mutants that lack sialic acid-binding activity contain single point mutations in the s protein cys155phe met195val arg196ser asp208asn or leu209pro 21 22 sialic acid-binding activity might help tgev to resist detergent-like substances encountered during gastrointestinal passage and therefore facilitate infection of the intestinal epithelium 23 we found that only cys155 is conserved in sars-cov this is in agreement with clinical findings that show that 2050 of sars patients present gastrointestinal symptoms 24 the low conservation of the s1a region among coronavirus sequences suggests that once more strains of sars-cov or other closely related species are available it will become possible to use innovative comparative sequence analyses to examine positive selection that acts in this region 1 several important functional determinants have been discovered in fragment s2 it contains a cytoplasmic tail enriched in cysteine residues 12171236 figure 2a this is a common feature among coronaviruses and appears to be related to membrane fusion 25 several authors have discovered that sars-cov s2 contains two conserved regions of heptad repeats 9131000 and 11511185 figure 2a 26 27 see also a press release by wr gallaher and rf garry httpwwwvirologynetsarss2modelhtml these heptads suggest that sars-cov uses mechanisms to gain entry to a cell that are similar to those used by human immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses and also ebola it is known that peptides derived from these repeat regions in hiv and the paramyxoviruses can specifically inhibit virus entry and subsequently viral replication 26 currently sars treatment is modeled after the drug known as t20 httpwwwhivmedicinecomtextbookdrugst20htm this drug is a complex peptide that is difficult to manufacture has a short half-life in the human body and must be injected this suggests that other regions of the genome such as s1b which might be of some interest for drug design should be described we report in figure 2d the consensus protein structure estimate of s1b obtained using passml-tm phd 10 and psi-pred 11 passml-tm also estimates the distribution of mutation rates along the protein and the sitewise mutation rate figure 2d the sars-cov genome is at rich 59 asymmetries in strand composition can reveal mutation bias for example cytosine deamination or selection 28 we found that the gc gcgc002 and at skew atat0037 in the sars-cov genome are smaller than those of the hiv genome gc skew is 015 and at skew is 023 which has a double-stranded rna genome with a similar at content this suggests the existence of some selection on g and c distribution along the sequence to control the types of rna secondary structure that form 29 cg is the only dinucleotide statistically under-represented fcgfcfg046 where fcg is the frequency of cg dinucleotides and significance is assessed according to refs 30 31 because this depletion is also found in the hiv genome but not in that of tobacco mosaic virus it might occur as a result of mutational bias in vertebrate cells comparison of the mutation patterns in the sars-cov genome sequences from 16 patients shows that a large number 3884 of the base substitutions detected at 84 sites occur within or near to single base and dinucleotide repeat stretches despite the absence of a pairing rule the ratio of rates of transition and transversion mutations is 2 as is often found in double-stranded dna the low gc and at skews and the low number of mutations suggest that evolvability of sars-cov might be restricted by selective constraints acting on the rna structure and packaging of the genome and therefore it might also be restricted by the low fitness of its mutational neighbours sequence features that form stems and loops that are potentially involved in coronavirus genome packaging have been described 32 33 mutational neighbours with different fitness might explain why although some rna viruses evolve at high rates some rna viruses are highly stable 34 35 interestingly the ease of tropism switching as exemplified by the closeness between turkey and chicken coronaviruses figure 1 is favoured by the large number of viral particles in each host by their mutation rates by the large populations of hosts birds and other species and by the aerial mode of viral spread for instance through sneezing and faeces these factors suggest that birds might act as powerful engines for virus evolution in this review we have highlighted that the s1 and s2 fragments of the sars-cov s protein have different mutational patterns on the basis of phylogenetic evidence figure 2b and the homology with the tgev 522744 region it is suggested that a short region of the s1 fragment which we denote s1b located at positions 400680 might be of particular interest to virologists structural biologists and biotechnologists the sitewise secondary structure solvent accessibility and mutation rate of this region have been estimated our work in progress includes further structural characterization and fold family determination at the moment sars appears to be under control despite doctors having neither drugs nor a vaccine to protect against it because it could reappear in the future research should proceed and hopefully our findings might assist in maintaining a feed-forward loop on sars-cov research between bioinformatics analysis and experimental work from microbiologists and virologists as a final comment it is notable that in all the phylogenies human coronaviruses hcov-229 and hcov-oc43 always cluster with porcine coronaviruses because ericsson and collaborators 36 reported the identification of two homologous human proteins that act as receptors for porcine endogenous retrovirus the benefits and risks of porcinehuman xenotransplantation should be carefully balanced  the origin and underlying driving forces of the sars-cov-2 outbreak shu-miaw chaw jui-hung tai shi-lun chen chia-hung hsieh sui-yuan chang shiou-hwei yeh wei-shiung yang pei-jer chen hurng-yi wang   a newly emerging coronavirus was detected in patients during an outbreak of respiratory illnesses starting in mid-december of 2019 in wuhan the capital of hubei province china 13 due to the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and genome organization similarity the causal virus was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 4 as of 3162020 167515 cases of sars-cov-2 infection have been confirmed in 114 countries causing 6606 fatalities as a result who declared the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus on 3112020 httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports as the virus continues to spread numerous strains have been isolated and sequenced on 3182020 more than 500 complete or nearly complete genomes have been sequenced and made publicly available sars-cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus found to infect humans among the other six sars-cov and mers-cov can cause severe respiratory illness whereas 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 produce mild symptoms 5 current evidence strongly suggests that all human associated coronaviruses originated from other animals such as bats and rodents 5 6 while sars-cov-2 shares similar genomic structure with other coronaviruses 710 its sequence differs substantially from some of the betacoronaviruses that infect humans such as sars-cov approximately 76 identity mers-cov 43 identity and hku-1 33 identity but exhibits 96 similarity to a coronavirus collected in yunnan province china from a bat rhinolophus affinis therefore sars-cov-2 most likely originated from bats 2 11 several issues concerning the origin time of virus introduction to humans evolutionary patterns and the underlying driving force of the sars-cov-2 outbreak remain to be clarified 12 13 here we analyzed genetic variation of sars-cov-2 and its related coronaviruses we discuss how mutational bias influences genetic diversity of the virus and attempt to infer forces that shape sars-cov-2 evolution 137 complete sars-cov-2 genomes were downloaded from the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg supplementary table 1 related coronavirus sequences including those from five related bat sequences ratg13 huk31 zc45 zxc-21 and gx2013 two pangolins each from guangdong pangolin2019 and guangxi pangolin2017 were downloaded from genbank httpswwwncbinlmnihgovnucleotide nucleotide positions and coding sequences cdss of sars-cov-2 were anchored to the reference genome nc045512 cds annotations of other coronaviruses were downloaded from genbank cdss were aligned based on translated amino acid sequences using muscle v3831 14 and back-translated to their corresponding dna sequences using tranalign software from the emboss package httpembossopen-bioorg 15 nucleotide diversity including number of segregating sites wattersons estimator of  16 and nucleotide diversity  17 was estimated using mega-x 18 mega-x was also used for phylogenetic construction phylogenetic relationships were constructed using the neighbor-joining method based on kimuras two-parameter model implemented in mega-x number of nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous site dn and synonymous changes per synonymous site ds among genomes were estimated based li-wu-luos method 19 implemented in mega-x and paml 4 20 the rdp file for the haplotype network analyses was generated using dnasp 60 21 and input into network 10 httpswwwfluxus-engineeringcom to construct the haplotype network using the median joining algorithm four haplotype test implemented in dnasp was applied to test for possible recombination event the mutation rate of sars-cov-2 and the time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca of virus isolates were estimated by an established bayesian mcmc approach implemented in beast version 1104 22 the sampling dates were incorporated into tmrca estimation the analysis was performed using the hky model of nucleotide substitution assuming an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock 23 we linked substitution rates for the first and second codon positions and allowed independent rates in the third codon position we performed two independent runs with 3  108 mcmc steps and the results were combined log files were checked using tracer httpbeastbgioedacuktracer effective sample sizes were  300 for all parameters the resulting phylogeny reveals that ratg13 is the closest relative of sars-cov-2 followed by pangolin2019 and pangolin2017 then covzc45 and covzxc21 and other sars-related sequences as outgroups supplementary fig 1 according to general time reversible model transition occurred more frequent than transversion with c-t and a-g changes account for 45 and 28 respectively of all six types of nucleotide changes we next estimated the strength of selection for each coding region using the dn and ds while purifying selection tends to remove amino acid-altering mutations thus reducing dn and dnds positive selection has the opposite effect increasing dn and dnds 24 between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 orf8 gene exhibits the highest dn 0032 highlighted in bold in table 1 followed by spike 0013 and orf7 0011 all above the genome average of 0007 table 1 ds varies greatly among cdss with the highest of 0313 in spike and the lowest of 0018 in envelope genome average 0168 finally dnds is the highest in orf8 0105 followed by orf7 0061 and orf3 0060 with the genome average of 0042 since spike shows both high ds and dn its protein evolution rate dnds is only 0040 thus while the coronavirus evolved very rapidly it has actually been under tremendous selective constraint 13
 spike protein similarity between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 led to the idea that the receptor binding domain rbd within the sars-cov-2 spike protein originated from pangolin2019 via recombination 2528 if that were the case we would expect the divergence at synonymous sites ds to also be reduced in the rbd region however while dn in the rbd region is 0023 approximately one third of the estimate for the rest of the spike gene 0068 ds in the rbd 0710 is actually slightly higher than in the rest of the spike sequence 0651 this argues against the recombination scenario we noticed that the ds of the whole spike and the rbd are 2- and 3-fold respectively higher than the genome average since synonymous sites are typically less influenced by selection the increased divergence in ds may require further investigation we downloaded 137 sars-cov-2 genomes available from gisaid as of 2232019 the coding regions were aligned and 223 mutations were identified with 68 synonymous and 155 nonsynonymous changes the directionality of changes was inferred based on the ratg13 sequence frequency spectra of both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes are skewed while the former shows excess of both high and low frequency mutations the latter mainly exhibits an excess of low frequency changes fig 1a the excess of low frequency mutations is consistent with the recent origin of sars-cov-2 29 both population reduction and positive selection can increase high frequency mutations 30 31 however the first scenario is contradicted by the recent origin of the virus if positive selection has been operating we would expect an excess of high frequency non-synonymous as well as synonymous changes furthermore the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous ns changes is 246 13856 among singleton variants but only 123 1613 among non-singletons both the nonsynonymous frequency spectrum and ns ratio demonstrate that the majority of amino acid-altering mutations did not reach to high frequency thus evidence for positive selection is limited
 the skew of synonymous variants toward high frequency deserves further discussion as it relates to the underlying force driving the sars-cov-2 outbreak the puzzle is probably rooted in how high and low frequency mutations are inferred the results shown in the fig 1a are based on an outgroup comparison the divergence at synonymous sites between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 is 17 approximately 3-fold greater than between humans and rhesus macaques 32 with such high level of divergence the possibility of multiple substitutions cannot be ignored especially since substitutions in coronavirus genomes are strongly biased toward transitions see above indeed among all non-singleton mutations listed in table 2 62 of the changes are c-t transitions
 to get around the potential problem caused by multiple substitutions we cross-referenced the course of changes using the sars-cov-2 haplotype network fig 2 and phylogeny supplementary fig 2 supplementary table 2 the two analyses yield very different pictures for example the highest frequency derived mutation in table 2 is a c-t synonymous change at 10138 marked  in fig 2 and table 2 all three sequences from singapore share the t nucleotide also found in the ratg13 outgroup using the outgroup comparison the c found in the rest of the human sars-cov-2 sequences is a derived mutation however the t at this position is restricted to genomes collected from singapore on 24 and 262020 and not found in earlier samples it is thus more sensible to infer that this t is a back mutation derived from c rather than an ancestral nucleotide another synonymous change at position 24034 occurred twice c24034t on different genomic backgrounds marked  in fig 2 although the outgroup sequence at this position is t it is more likely that the c at this position is the ancestral nucleotide we observed a number of such back or repeated mutations an a-t nonsynonymous change at 29019 d249h in nucleocapsid protein marked o in fig 2 also occurred twice
 repeated mutations may be caused by intergenomic recombination indeed the result of four haplotype test suggested that at least two recombination events may have occurred between positions 8782 and 11083 and between 11083 and 28854 we noticed that a sequence isolated on 1212020 from a patient in the united states epiisl404253 exhibited y c or t at both positions 8782 and 28144 although the possibility that two novel mutations might have occurred within this patient cannot be 100 ruled out the alternative explanation that this patient may have been co-infected by two viral strains seems more plausible after cross-referencing with the haplotype network and the phylogeny all mutations listed as high frequency in table 2 and fig 1a were re-assigned to the other side of the frequency spectra we only see an excess of singleton mutations consistent with a recent origin of sars-cov-2 fig 1b and suggesting that the virus has mainly evolved under constraint perhaps the most controversial case is the t-c change at position 28814 which alters leucine l to serine s in orf8 protein l84s since both pangolin and ratg13 have a c at this position table 2 tang et al suggested that 84 l is derived from 84s in the human virus 13 the 84s was not discovered until 152020 by which time 23 sars-cov-2 genomes have been sampled after the first appearance its frequency gradually increased reaching approximately 30 by 1232020 suggesting that 84s may exhibit some advantage over 84 l if genomes carrying 84s were ancestral it would be a challenge to explain its absence in early samplings in addition as mentioned above c-t transitions are dominant in coronavirus evolution and multiple hits were observed in sars-cov-2 fig 2 it is therefore possible that 28814c mutated to t after ancestral sars-cov-2 diverged from the common ancestor with ratg13 and recently changed back to c finally if 84 l is indeed a derived haplotype and has rapidly increased in its frequency by positive selection we would expect haplotypes carrying 84 l to have accumulated more derived mutations than haplotypes with 84s however after correcting for mutational direction the two haplotypes exhibited similar mutation frequency spectra supplementary fig 3 the alternative hypothesis that 84s is a back mutation from 84 l is more plausible in addition to l84s a g-t transversion at 26144 which caused an amino acid change in orf3 protein g251v is also at intermediate frequency table 2 251 v was first seen on 1222020 and gradually increased its frequency to 13 by our sampling date fig 3 we note that the emergence of 84s in orf8 and 251 v in orf3 proteins are consistent with the lockdown of wuhan on 1232020 the former first appeared in early january gradually increased its frequency and reached a plateau around 1232020 the latter showed up on 1222020 and rapidly increased its frequency within 2 weeks
 based on fig 3 we divided the sampling course into two epidemic episodes from the first sampled sequence 12242019 to before the lockdown of wuhan 1212020 and from 1222020 to the date of the last sequence sampling 2232020 the dnds of coding regions within the two episodes were estimated as roughly 87 of mutations were singletons many of these are probably sequencing errors affecting synonymous and nonsynonymous sites equally and inflating our dnds estimates in addition since dnds is already extremely small in sars-cov-2 table 1 such inflation would have a large effect on dnds estimates we therefore estimated dn and ds with supplementary table 3 and without singletons table 3
 the dnds of orf8 gene in episode i and ii and orf3 gene in episode ii show strong signatures of positive selection consistent with increase of 84s and 251 v frequency during these periods and may suggest a role of adaptation table 3 the overall dnds within each episode was 510 times higher than dnds between coronavirus genomes derived from different species table 1 the elevated dnds of sars-cov-2 is either due to its adaptation to human hosts or relaxation of selection for a recently emerged virus it is reasonable to expect operation of positive selection at the early stage in that case the dnds during episode i should be greater than during episode ii 33 34 when singletons were included dnds in episode i was approximately 20 higher than that in episode ii across the genome supplementary table 3 in contrast we observed the opposite result after removing singletonsie dnds in episode i was approximately 50 lower than that in episode ii table 3 therefore the elevation of dnds was most probably due to a relaxation in selection we further divided episode i into ia and ib according to the appearance of 84s in orf8 protein on 162020 the genome-wide dnds values were 027 and 023 for episode 1a and 1b respectively supplementary table 4 therefore as shown in the frequency spectra the signature of positive selection is weak at the early stage of the epidemic the estimated mutation rate of sars-cov-2 is 24  10 3siteyear with 95 highest posterior density hpd of 1533  10 3siteyear the mutation rate at the third codon position is 29  10 3siteyear 95 hpd 1840  10 3siteyear which is in a good agreement with synonymous mutation rate of sars-cov 167467  10 3 siteyear 34 sars-cov-2 is estimated to have originated on 12112019 95 hpd 1113201912232019 the initial effective population size of the virus was small which is consistent with the recent origin of sars-cov-2 the population size showed approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of wuhan 1232020 and ceased to increase afterwards demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing on preventing virus spread fig 4 we have to point out that the tmrca and epidemic growth curve estimation are strongly influenced by the sampling scheme for example since the earliest available genome was sampled on 12242019 almost 1 month after the outbreak the real origin of the current outbreak may actually be earlier than our estimation in addition all sequences from wuhan were sampled before 01052020 which would have an influence on demographic estimation
 we estimated genetic variation including the number of segregating sites wattersons estimator of  and nucleotide diversity  of the sars-cov-2 since both  and  are estimators of 4nu n and u are the effective population size and mutation rate respectively they should be close to each other at the mutation-drift equilibrium 35 because  is strongly influenced by rare mutations which are common during recent population expansion 24 it is a better estimator of genetic diversity for sars-cov-2 for example when all samples are considered  1392  10 4 is approximately eight times higher than  181  10 4 table 4 among samples collected from different locations sequences from china exhibited higher genetic variation in terms of the number of segregating sites  and  than the rest of the world combined consistent with the observation that the outbreak originated in china as the source populations are expected to exhibit higher genetic variation than derived populations 35
 the haplotype network also supports this notion fig 2 usually ancestral haplotypes have a greater probability of being in the interior have more mutational connections and are geographically more widely distributed the h1 haplotype is at the center of the network and is found in four countries and many places in china in addition a large portion of haplotypes is directly connected to h1 therefore it is likely that h1 is the ancestral haplotype as 45 of h1 are found in wuhan this location is the most plausible origin of the ongoing pandemic a close relationship between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 at the amino acid level in the rbd region of the spike protein might be due to recent recombination 25 26 data contamination or convergent evolution since recent recombination and dna contamination should affect synonymous and nonsynonymous sites equally they can be convincingly rejected as great divergence at synonymous sites was observed in spite of similar amino acid sequences between the two genomes while genotypic convergence may be observed in viruses repeatedly evolving under particular conditions such as drug resistance and immune escape 3639 it is otherwise rare for adaptations that do not involve highly specialized conditions divergent molecular pathways may develop and genotypic convergence would not be expected 40 for example sars-cov and sars-cov-2 both use the spike protein to bind human ace2 2 but five out of six critical amino acids within the rbd are different between these two viruses 27 since the sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 have diverged at about 47 of synonymous sites and infect different hosts the idea that they share five out of six critical amino acids within rbd through convergent evolution seems far-fetched we therefore hypothesize that instead of convergent evolution the similarity of rbd between sars-cov-2 and pangolin2019 was caused by an ancient inter-genomic recombination assuming a synonymous substitution rate of 29  10 3siteyear the recombination was estimated to have occurred approximately 40 years ago 95 hpd 3169 years divergence time t  divergence dssubstitution rate  2  3 considering ds in rbd is 3-fold of genome average the amino acids in the rbd region of the two genomes have been maintained by natural selection ever since while synonymous substitutions have been accumulated if this is true sars-cov-2 may have circulated cryptically among humans for years before being recently noticed the ancient origin of sars-cov-2 is supported by its lack of a signature of adaptive evolution as shown by frequency spectra and dnds in samples from the recent epidemic for a recently acquired virus rapid evolution and a strong signature of positive selection are expected for example during its short epidemic in 20022003 several rounds of adaptive changes have been documented in sars-cov genomes 33 34 after adapting to its host the virus may evolve under purifying or relaxed selection exactly as we see in sars-cov-2 therefore it is important to sequence samples from the early outbreak and to examine hospital archives for the trace of sars-cov-2 ancestors this information not only can help us to understand the evolutionary path of this virus but also unravel the critical steps for it to achieve effective spreading in humans in addition to the rbd the sars-cov-2 spike protein also contains a small insertion of a polybasic cleavage site which was thought to be unique within the b lineage of betacoronaviruses 27 however a recent analysis of bats collected from yunnan china identified a similar insertion in a sequence rmyn02 closely related to sars-cov-2 providing strong evidence that such seemingly sorcerous site insertions can occur in nature 11 both the polybasic cleavage site in rmyn02 and rbd in pangolin2019 suggest that like with sars-cov 6 all genetic elements required to form sars-cov-2 may have existed in the environment more importantly they can be brought together by frequent intergenomic recombination see result nature never runs out of material to create new pathogens it is not whether but when and where the next epidemic will occur there is a heated debate about the evolutionary forces influencing the trajectory of the l84s mutation in orf8 protein httpvirologicalorgtresponse-to-on-the-origin-and-continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2418 while tang et al considered serine is the ancestral amino acid 13 we present evidence that it is a back mutation the majority of sequences in wuhan were sampled before early january 2020 and most genomes carrying 84s were found outside wuhan after middle to late january 2020 the discrepancy in time and space impedes the effort to resolve the debate it would require more sequences from the early stage of the epidemic to settle this issue regardless of its ancestral or derived status we hypothesize that 84s may confer some selective advantage unless the sampling scheme is deliberately skewed it is difficult to explain such dramatic frequency gain of 84s from 0 to  30 in 2 weeks oddly its frequency ceased to increase after 1232020 when wuhan was locked down this coincidence prompts us to consider the effect of social distancing on virus transmission another line of evidence comes from the frequency increase of 215 v in orf3 protein the 215 v first appeared on 1222020 and rapidly increased its frequency within 2 weeks several studies suggested that the orf8 protein may function in viral replication modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress inducing apoptosis and inhibiting interferon responses in host cells 4145 4145 during the sars spread frequency of several orf8 mutations fluctuated in accordance with different phases of the outbreak suggesting that orf8 underwent adaptation during the sars epidemic 34 it is suggested that 84s may induce structural disorder in the c-terminus of the protein and may generate a novel phosphorylation target for serinethreonine kinases of the mammalian hosts 46 sars-cov orf3 protein has been shown to activate nf-b and the nlrp3 inflammasome and causes necrotic cell death lysosomal damage and caspase-1 activation in addition orf3 is required for maximal sars-cov replication and virulence all of the above likely contributes to the clinical manifestations of sars-cov infection 4749 therefore these two mutations may have some functional consequences and be worth investigating further by the time we prepared this manuscript the 215 v frequency ceased to increase however a parallel mutation has occurred in a different genomic background further supporting the idea that this mutation may require further study in contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for sars-cov in its brief epidemic our analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection which in combination with an ancient intergenomic introgression in rbd of spike protein suggests that sars-cov-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading we found that the lockdown of wuhan is strongly associated with frequency fluctuations of 84s in orf8 and 215 v in orf3 proteins and population size of the virus suggesting the effectiveness of human intervention such as social distancing on preventing virus spread  d614g mutation of sars-cov-2 spike protein enhances viral infectivity 1 running title d614g mutant spike

huang ni tang  coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory 22 syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the spike s protein that mediates 23 sars-cov-2 entry into host cells is a major target for vaccines and therapeutics 24 thus insights into its sequence variations are key to understanding the infection 25 and antigenicity of sars-cov-2 a dominant mutational variant at position 614 of 26 the s protein aspartate to glycine d614g mutation was observed in the sars-27 cov-2 genome sequence obtained from the nextstrain database using a 28 pseudovirus-based assay we identified that s-d614 and s-g614 protein 29 pseudotyped viruses share a common receptor human angiotensin-converting 30 enzyme 2 ace2 which could be blocked by recombinant ace2 with the fused fc 31 region of human igg1 however s-d614 and s-g614 protein demonstrated 32 functional differences first s-g614 protein could be cleaved by serine protease 33 elastase-2 more efficiently second s-g614 pseudovirus infected 293t-ace2 34 cells significantly more efficiently than did the s-d614 pseudovirus especially in 35 the presence of elastase-2 third an elastase inhibitor approved for clinical use 36 blocked elastase-enhanced s-g614 pseudovirus infection moreover 93 6570 37 convalescent sera from patients with covid-19 could neutralize both s-d614 and 38 s-g614 pseudoviruses with comparable efficiencies but about 7 570 39 convalescent sera showed reduced neutralizing activity against the s-g614 40 pseudovirus these findings have important implications for sars-cov-2 41 transmission and immune interventions 42 2  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel 47 coronavirus reported in 2019 that caused the recent outbreak of coronavirus 48 disease 2019 covid-19 1  by july 4 2020 the world health organization who 49 reported that 1092 million people worldwide had been infected with sars-cov-2 50 and that 523 000 individuals had died of covid-19 this pandemic has had a 51 significant adverse impact on international social and economic activities 52 coronaviruses are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that contain the 53 largest known rna genomes to date the rna genome of sars-cov-2 has been 54 rapidly sequenced to facilitate diagnostic testing molecular epidemiologic source 55 tracking and development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies 2  the mutation 56 rate for rna viruses is extremely high which may contribute to their transmission 57 and virulence the only significant variation in the sars-cov-2 spike s protein is 58 a non-synonymous d614g aspartate d to glycine g mutation 3  primary data 59 showed that s-g614 is a more pathogenic strain of sars-cov-2 with high 60 transmission efficiency 3  however whether the d614g mutation in the s protein 61 affects viral entry and infectivity in a cellular model is still unclear the s protein of coronavirus the major determinant of host and tissue tropism is a 64 3 major target for vaccines neutralizing antibodies and viral entry inhibitors 45  65 similar to sars-cov the cellular receptor of sars-cov-2 is angiotensin- 66 converting enzyme 2 ace2 however the sars-cov-2 s protein has a 10-to 67 20-fold higher affinity for ace2 than the corresponding s protein of sars-cov 67   d614g mutation of sars-cov-2 s protein was globally distributed 96 the s protein of sars-cov-2 which contains 1273 amino acids forms a trimeric 97 spike on the virion surface and plays an essential role in viral entry we analyzed 98 the sars-cov-2 s protein amino acid sequence from viral genomic sequences in 99 the gisaid database in line with prior reports we found a globally distributed s 100 protein mutation d614 to g614 which represented 646 of all the analyzed 101 sequences  fig 1 and table 1  among the top 10 most abundant non-102 synonymous mutations observed in the s protein the relative abundance of the 103 d614g mutant the clade g was the highest around the world indicating that 104 g614 strain may be selectively advantageous since the s protein is critical to 105 coronavirus infection we sought to explore the potential impact of the most 106 prevalent d614g mutation on the s protein structure expression and function using the cryo-electron microscopy structure of s protein pbd id 6zge 108 5 determined by wrobel et al 10  we analyzed the potential effects of the d614g 109 mutation as shown in fig 1b  residue d614 is located at the c-terminal region of 110 the s1 domain which directly associates with s2 on the one hand residue d614 111 forms a hydrogen bond with backbone of g593 and a salt bridge with k854 and 112 then is capped by the folded 833-855 motif of chain b fig 1c  d614g mutation we observed that d614 is remarkably close to the n-linked glycosylation site n616 117 fig 1c  thus the d614g mutation may enhance the fitness of sars-cov-2 by as the d614g mutation is proximal to the s1 cleavage domain we predicted 123 potential cleavage sites of proteases in s protein variants using prosper 11  and 124 identified a novel serine protease elastase-2 cleavage site at residues 615-616 125 on the s1-s2 junction of the s-g614 protein fig 2a table s2  to evaluate the expression and cleavage of sars-cov-2 s protein in a 127 human cell line the codon-optimized s protein-expressing plasmids ps-d614 and 128 ps-g614 were transfected into hek 293t cells the immunoblot analysis of 129 whole cell lysates revealed that both s-d614 and s-g614 proteins showed two 130 6 major protein bands unprocessed s and cleaved s1 subunit when allowed to 131 react with the monoclonal antibody targeting the rbd on the sars-cov-2 s 132 protein fig 2b  however the ps-g614-transfected cells showed a stronger s1 133 signal than ps-d614-transfected cells indicating that the d614g mutation altered 134 the cleavability of the s protein by cellular proteases moreover the elastase 135 inhibitor sivelestat sodium significantly decreased the s1 signal of s-d614 protein 136 fig 2b  these data indicate that the d614g mutation of sars-cov-2 s 137 facilitates its cleavage by host serine protease elastase-2 the coronavirus s 138 protein must be cleaved by host proteases to enable membrane fusion which is 139 critical for viral entry next we sought to explore the impact of d614g mutation on sodium than the s-d614 pseudovirus 197 we also tested two other protease inhibitors camostat mesylate and e-64d which 198 block host tmprss2 and catbl respectively in 293t-ace2 cells lacking 199 tmprss2 the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate did not inhibit s-d614 the serum from patient 1 failed to neutralize the s-g614 pseudovirus even 225 though it neutralized about 30 of the s-d614 pseudovirus at a 11000 dilution then the inhibition curves and half-maximal inhibitory dose id50 of sera samples 227 from five convalescent patients and one healthy donor were analyzed sera from 228 patients 17 and 39 which were able to neutralize both pseudoviruses to similar 229 degrees showed similar id50 values fig 4b  however sera from patients 1 7 230 40 42 and 52 showed relative high neutralizing activity against the s-d614 231 pseudovirus with an id50 ranging from 729 to 1524 but showed decreased 232 neutralizing activity against the s-g614 pseudovirus with an id50 ranging from 216 233 to 367 indicating a 25-to 59-fold reduction in neutralizing titers fig 4b  these of the s-g614 protein thereby enhancing viral entry into 293t-ace2 cells fig 5  247 we demonstrated the potential role of the elastase-2 inhibitor sivelestat in blocking in summary we established a sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated pseudoviral entry 325 assay and explored the cellular entry of s-d614 and s-g614 pseudotyped viruses our study provided evidence that the d614g mutation introduces an additional 327 elastase-2 cut site in the s protein thereby promoting its cleavage and viral cell table s1  all sera were tested positive using magnetic   formation of stable homodimer via the c-terminal -helical domain of coronavirus nonstructural protein 9 is critical for its function in viral replication bo chen shouguo fang james tam p ding liu xiang   coronavirus is a family of rna viruses with the largest rna genome known so far in cells infected with coronavirus a nested set of genomic and subgenomic rna species is produced and used for translation of viral structural and nonstructural proteins among these proteins the 1a and 1ab polyproteins are post-translationally processed to smaller mature proteins ziebuhr et al 2000 ziebuhr 2005 it is generally believed that replication of the large rna genome and transcription of a nested set of 5 to 8 subgenomic rna species are carried out by these replicase proteins however the exact functions of individual replicase proteins are largely unknown in recent years determination of the crystal structures of some of these proteins including the proteinase domain of nsp3 nsp5 nsp7 and 8 nsp9 nsp10 and nsp15 led to the revelation of many important functions for these proteins saikatendu et al 2005 ratia et al 2006 peti et al 2005 zhai et al 2005 anand et al 2002 anand et al 2003 yang et al 2003 egloff et al 2004 sutton et al 2004 su et al 2006 joseph et al 2006 ricagno et al 2006 but most of these functions are not rigorously tested in a biologically relevant system in this study residues critical for dimerization and the rna-binding activity of nsp9 protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv were systematically studied by mutagenesis based on the structural studies of sars-cov nsp9 protein ibv is a group 3 coronavirus its genome contains a 276 kb single-stranded positive-sense rna in the virus-infected cells six mrna species including the genome-length mrna 1 and five subgenomic mrnas mrna 26 are produced and each mrna species possesses a 64 nucleotides leader sequence derived from the 5-end of the genome boursnell et al 1987 subgenomic mrnas 2 3 4 and 6 encode the four structural proteins ie spike glycoprotein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n the 5-two-third region of mrna 1 encodes the 1a and 1ab polyproteins which are proteolytically cleaved by two virus-encoded proteinases the papain-like and 3c-like proteinases into at least 15 nonstructural proteins nsp2nsp16 lim and liu 1998a lim and liu 1998b lim et al 2000 liu et al 1995 liu et al 1997 liu et al 1998 ng and liu 1998 ng and liu 2000 ng and liu 2002 xu et al 2001 a cluster of small proteins ie nsp7 nsp8 nsp9 and nsp10 is located at the c-terminal region of the la polyprotein the functional roles of these proteins in coronavirus rna replication and transcription are emerging via biochemical and structural analysis for example the sars-cov nsp8 protein was recently shown to have a non-canonical rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp activity imbert et al 2006 most of the replicase products could be assembled into a membrane-associated viral replicationtranscription complex sims et al 2000 gosert et al 2002 prentice et al 2004 shi et al 1999 bost et al 2000 masters 2006 brockway et al 2003 determination of the crystal structure of sars-cov nsp9 protein shows that it forms a homodimer egloff et al 2004 sutton et al 2004 searching for structural homology between sars-cov nsp9 and other rna binding proteins suggests that the sars-cov nsp9 protein is a nucleic acid-binding protein and has nonspecific rna-binding activity egloff et al 2004 biophysical evidence has also shown an interaction between sars-cov nsp9 and nsp8 proteins sutton et al 2004 based on sequence comparison a number of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues in different domains of the ibv nsp9 protein were systematically mutated to assess their roles in viral replication and infectivity by introducing into an infectious cdna clone system derived from the genomic rna of ibv subsequently dimerization and the rna-binding activity of the purified wild type and mutant ibv nsp9 protein were studied by immunoprecipitation gel filtration chemical cross linking and northwestern blotting these studies led to the identification of amino acid residues essential for dimerization and the rna-binding activity of ibv nsp9 protein this study thus presents biochemical and genetic evidence that directly links dimerization and the rna binding activity of the coronavirus nsp9 protein to virus replication and infectivity in cultured cells this information would be of help in design of preventive and treatment approaches against coronavirus infection multiple alignment of the nsp9 sequences from ibv accession no np

a systematic mutagenesis of the ibv nsp9 protein was carried out to identify amino acid residues critical for the dimerization and the rna-binding activity of the protein the effect of these mutations on the infectivity and replication of ibv was studied by using an infectious ibv cloning system nine point mutations k10a y31a k51a y87a k90a i95a i95n g98a and g98d fig 1a were made and introduced separately into the infectious ibv clone the in vitro transcribed full-length rna derived from wild type and the mutant constructs were generated by in vitro transcription using the t7 rna polymerase in the presence of a cap analog electroporation of wild type rna transcripts together with an rna fragment covering the n protein region into vero cells showed the formation of massive cytopathic effect cpe at 2 days post-electroporation fig 1b and data not shown similarly typical cpes were observed in cells transfected with mutant transcripts derived from k10a y31a k51a k90a i95a and g98a constructs at 2 days post-electroporation and recombinant viruses were recovered fig 1b in cells electroporated with the i95n transcripts a typical cpe was observed at 3 days post-electroporation fig 1b re-infection of fresh vero cells with medium collected from total cell lysates prepared by freezing and thawing cells transfected with these mutant transcripts showed the formation of typical cpe indicating that the mutant viruses rescued from the initially transfected cells maintain infectivity in subsequent passages in contrast no cpe formation was observed in cells transfected with transcripts derived from y87a and g98d mutant constructs up to 5 days post-electroporation in four repeated experiments fig 1b subsequent infection of fresh cells with cell lysate preparations by freezing and thawing the initially transfected cells showed no sign of ibv infection as judged by cpe formation and western blot analysis data not shown suggesting that no infectious virus could be rescued from these mutant transcripts these results indicate that y87a and g98d mutations may abolish the infectivity of the in vitro synthesized full-length ibv transcripts as the c-terminal domain may play an essential role in dimerization of nsp9 protein and dimerization was thought to be critical for its rna binding activity the effects of mutations in the c-terminal region were firstly characterized in the following studies the growth properties of i95a i95n and g98a mutant viruses on vero cells were tested by analysis of plaque sizes and growth curves of the passage 3 mutant viruses as shown in fig 2a very similarly sized plaques were observed in cells infected with wild type ribv and the mutant viruses analysis of the growth curves of wild type and mutant viruses demonstrated that the i95a and g98a mutant viruses exhibited similar growth kinetics as wild type virus reaching the peak at 16 h post-infection fig 2a at this time point the titers of the two mutant viruses were approximately 23 fold lower than that of wild type virus fig 2a the i95n mutant virus grew more slowly than wild type virus reaching the peak at 24 h post-infection fig 2a the titer of this mutant virus was approximately 100 fold lower than that of wild type virus fig 2a as no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with g98d mutant transcripts total rna was extracted from cells electroporated with wild type and mutant full-length transcripts and rt-pcr amplification of negative strand rna was performed to check if rna replication occurred in these transfected cells the primer pair was chosen so that the ibv sequence from nucleotides 14931 to 15600 would be amplified by the rt-pcr reaction if replication of viral rna occurred a 670 bp pcr fragment would be expected as shown in fig 2b rt-pcr fragments amplified from both positive lanes 2 and 5 and negative lanes 3 and 6 strand rna templates were obtained from cells transfected with wild type and the mutant transcripts the amount of negative strand rna was approximately one third of the positive strand rna fig 2b rt-pcr amplification of subgenomic mrnas was then carried out to check whether a low level of subgenomic mrna transcription occurred in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts the forward primer used in this reaction corresponds to the leader sequence from nucleotides 2646 in the genomic rna and the downstream primers covers ibv sequences from nucleotides 24784 to 24803 if transcription of subgenomic mrnas did occur a 415 bp pcr product corresponding to the 5-terminal region of the subgenomic mrna4 and a 1010 bp fragment corresponding to the 5-terminal region of the subgenomic mrna3 would be expected as shown in fig 2b a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild type full-length transcripts at two days post-electroporation lane 4 however the same pcr products were not detected in cells electroporated with the mutant transcripts at 72 h post-electroporation fig 2b lane 7 biochemical analysis of the effect of i95a i95n g98a and g98d mutations on the dimerization and rna-binding activity of the ibv nsp9 was then carried out to understand the detailed mechanisms of these point mutations on the replication and infectivity of ibv for this purpose wild type and mutant fragments with a 6-his tag at their n-terminus were cloned into a bacterial expression vector expressed in e coli and purified to near homogeneity after removing the 6-his tag the purified proteins were treated with 02 of glutaraldehyde a short self-polymerizing reagent that reacts with lysine tyrosine histidine and tryptophan residues and analyzed by sds-page gradually increased detection of the homodimer was observed following cross-linking of wild type and mutant proteins with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking agent fig 3a interestingly it was noted that g98d mutant protein showed much less if any dimer formation without cross-linking with glutaraldehyde fig 3a the i95n mutant protein also showed significantly reduced dimer formation under the same conditions fig 3a these results suggest that the i95n and g98d mutations may destabilize the ibv nsp9 homodimer this possibility was further studied in the following two ways first the purified wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed by gel filtration after removing the 6-his tag the results showed the detection of two peaks for wild type and the i95n mutant fig 3b analysis of the two peaks by mass spectrometry confirmed that they indeed represent the nsp9 monomers and dimers respectively however only one peak was observed for the g98d mutant protein fig 3b once again analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed that it represents the nsp9 monomers containing the right point mutation second wild type i95n and g98d mutant nsp9 were cloned into a mammalian expression vector with either a flag or a myc tag at the n-terminus the flag-tagged wild type nsp9 were co-expressed with the myc-tagged wild type nsp9 i95n and g98d mutants respectively the association of wild type nsp9 protein with either wild type or mutant nsp9 proteins was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiment with anti-flag antibody the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on sds-page and analyzed by western blotting with either anti-flag or anti-myc antibody as shown in fig 3c western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed the detection of similar amounts of wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins either expressed on their own or co-expressed with the flag-tagged wild type nsp9 fig 3c top panel analysis of the precipitates with anti-flag antibody showed the presence of approximately equal amounts of the flag-tagged wild type nsp9 either expressed on its own or co-expressed with the myc-tagged wild type and mutant nsp9 fig 3c middle panel analysis of the same precipitates with anti-myc antibody showed that efficient detection of the myc-tagged wild type nsp9 was made only when it was co-expressed with the flag-tagged nsp9 protein fig 3c bottom panel lane 5 interestingly much reduced detection of the myc-tagged i95n was observed when it was co-expressed with the flag-tagged wild type nsp9 fig 3c bottom panel lane 6 demonstrating that this point mutation destabilizes the nsp9 homodimer when the myc-tagged g98d construct was co-expressed with the flag-tagged wild type nsp9 the mutant protein was not detected in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment fig 3c bottom panel lane 7 taken together these results confirm that the g98d mutation totally abolishes the nsp9 homodimer formation the effect of these mutations on the single strand rna-binding activity of ibv nsp9 was then investigated by northwestern blotting approximately equal amounts of the purified wild type and g98d mutant proteins were separated on sds-page either before or after removal of the 6-his tag fig 4a top panel once again formation of reasonable amounts of dimer was detected in the purified wild type protein fig 4a top panel lane 3 after transfer to a hybond c extra membrane the rna-binding activities of wild type and g98d mutant proteins were analyzed by northwestern blot with two probes corresponding respectively to the positive- and negative-sense 3-utr of ibv the results showed that both wild type and g98d mutant proteins with the 6-his tag could efficiently bind to either probe fig 4a middle and bottom panels lanes 1 and 2 it was noted that efficient detection of the dimeric form of the two proteins was achieved when either probe was used fig 4a middle and bottom panels lanes 1 and 2 suggesting preferential binding of the probes to the homodimer of the protein after removal of the 6-his tag both the monomeric and dimeric forms of the purified wild type protein could still efficiently bind to either probe fig 4a middle and bottom panels lane 3 however very weak if any binding of the g98d mutant protein to either probe was observed after removal of the 6-his tag fig 4a middle and bottom panels lane 4 suggesting that this point mutation abolishes the rna-binding activity of ibv nsp9 protein the other three mutant proteins showed similar rna-binding activity as wild type protein except that g98a mutant showed greatly reduced binding activity to the negative rna probe fig 4a lane 7 the binding efficiency of wild type and the four mutant proteins was then quantified by densitometry measurement of bands from three independent experiments the relative rna-binding efficiencies of the mutant proteins to wild type protein are shown in fig 4b the results demonstrated that the g98d mutant protein maintained 0 and 4 binding efficiencies and the g98a mutant showed 75 and 10 binding efficiencies to the positive and negative probes respectively fig 4b the i95a and i95n mutant proteins showed 80 to 100 binding efficiencies to both probes fig 4b biochemical characterization of the effects of other five mutations k10a y31a k51a y87a and k90a on the dimerization and rna-binding activity of ibv nsp9 protein was then carried out the k10a y31a k51a and k90a mutant proteins were successfully expressed in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity efforts were made to express the y87a mutant protein in the same system however very low if any expression of the mutant protein was consistently observed for some unknown reasons data not shown this mutant construct was not included in the subsequent studies after removing the 6-his tag the purified proteins were treated with 02 of glutaraldehyde and analyzed by sds-page showing gradually increased detection of the homodimer following cross-linking of wild type and mutant proteins with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking agent fig 5a analysis of the purified proteins by gel filtration showed the presence of two peaks for wild type and the mutant proteins fig 5a the rna-binding activity of wild type and the mutant proteins was then analyzed by northwestern blot in three independent experiments as a representative gel shown in fig 5b the k10a and k90a mutations greatly reduced the rna-binding activity to either probe lanes 2 and 5 the k51a mutant protein showed moderately reduced binding activity fig 5b lane 4 and the y31a mutant protein showed marginally reduced binding activity fig 5b lanes 3 and 6 quantification by densitometry measurement of bands from three independent experiments showed that the k10a and k90a mutants maintained approximately 10 binding efficiency to either probe the k51a mutant protein approximately 35 and 55 binding efficiencies to the positive and negative probes respectively and the y31a and i95n mutant proteins 80 to 100 binding efficiencies to both probes fig 5c the growth properties of the recovered k10a y31a k51a and k90a mutant viruses on vero cells were tested by analysis of plaque sizes and growth curves of the passage 3 mutant viruses as shown in fig 6c very similarly sized plaques were observed in cells infected with wild type ribv and y31a and k51a mutant viruses in cells infected with k10a and k90a and mutant viruses plaques with slightly smaller size were observed fig 5c analysis of the growth curves of wild type and mutant viruses demonstrated that the y31a and k51a exhibited similar growth kinetics as wild type virus reaching the peak at 16 h post-infection fig 5c at this time point the titers of the two mutant viruses were approximately 5 fold lower than that of wild type virus fig 5c the other two mutant viruses k10a and k90a grew slightly more slowly than wild type virus reaching the peak at 24 h post-infection fig 5c the titers of these mutant viruses were approximately 20 fold lower than that of wild type virus fig 5c coronavirus encodes two large polyproteins 1a and 1ab polyproteins by the genome-length mrna mrna1 it is generally believed that the functionally active form of the coronavirus replicase proteins would consist of 1516 smaller mature proteins nsp1nsp16 derived by proteolytic cleavage of these two polyproteins in this study systematic mutagenesis of one of these proteins nsp9 was carried out to study the functional roles of this protein in coronavirus rna replication and infectivity our results are consistent with structural data that indicate that nsp9 forms homodimers and we have identified residues that are essential for nsp9 function during virus replication substitution of a negatively charged amino acid asp for a conserved g98 residue in the c-terminal -helix greatly destabilized the ibv nsp9 homodimer and abolished the rna-binding activity of the protein consequently introduction of the same mutation into the infectious ibv clone system showed that the mutation abolished the transcription of subgenomic rna and no infectious virus could be rescued interestingly mutation of a semi-conserved ile i95 residue in the same region showed minimal effect on the rna-binding activity of the protein and moderately destabilizing effect on the homodimer introduction of this mutation into the ibv infectious clone system showed the recovery of a mutant virus with severe growth defects supporting that dimerization is critical for the function of this replicase protein in previous structural studies the crystal structure of sars-cov nsp9 crystal contains a dimer in the asymmetric unit fig 6 in each monomer seven- strands and one -helix form a cone-shaped -barrel flanked by the c-terminal -helix fig 6 the c-terminal -helix has a high content of hydrophobic residues yielding two hydrophobic sides one side faces the -barrel and the other interacts with the c-terminal -helix of the second crystallographic monomer to form the homodimer fig 6 this homodimer is therefore assembled by hydrophobic interactions egloff et al 2004 sutton et al 2004 analysis of the purified sars-cov nsp9 protein by surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that it is a single strand rna-binding protein egloff et al 2004 this single strand rna-binding activity was further confirmed by fluorescence experiments egloff et al 2004 by structural modeling the ibv nsp9 protein was found to adopt a very similar folding as the sars-cov nsp9 protein fig 6 based on these structural studies the topology of nsp9 protein was shown to most closely resemble the domains of the 3c-like proteinase 3clpro which belongs to the serine proteinase superfamily berman et al 2000 structure alignments revealed that it best matches to the domain ii of the coronavirus 3clpro and subdomian i of the picornaviral 3cpro suggesting that the two groups of proteins may share certain evolutionary relationship and may play some regulatory functions sutton et al 2004 the direct correlation of the rna replication efficiency and infectivity of ibv with the stability of the nsp9 homodimer confirms that dimer is the functional form of the protein interestingly the functionally active unit of the coronavirus 3clpro is also a dimeric form of the protein anand et al 2003 a recent study by ponnusamy et al 2008 reported that hcov-229e nsp9 forms a different homodimer from sars-cov nsp9 in spite of a sequence identity of 45 between the two proteins in hcov-229e nsp9 dimerization is mediated by a disulfide bridge a few hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction between the c-terminal helix of each monomer the structural difference between hcov-229e and sars-cov nsp9 may be due to the presence of extra residues from the cloning procedure at the n-terminus of the sars-cov nsp9 preparation used for structure determination which could result in different homodimer forms and different biological functions of proteins in this study we observed that the six his-tags in the n-terminus of ibv nsp9 rendered drastic effects on dimerization and rna-binding activity of the protein the six-his tag was removed by factor xa from all wild type and mutant constructs in our biochemical studies of the protein hcov-229e nsp9 has a cys cys 69 residue in the alpha helix at the homodimer interface and forms a disulfide bridge this form of nsp9 dimer can bind to single-stranded rna more tightly and therefore promote replication of the viral genome ponnusamy et al 2008 the sars-cov nsp9 has three cys residues and one of them cys 73 is corresponding to cys 69 in hcov-229e nsp9 however these residues are not involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bond ponnusamy et al 2008 as the number and position of cys residues in ibv nsp9 are completely conserved with sars-cov nsp9 the ibv nsp9 may form dimer mainly through hydrophobic interaction similar to sars-cov nsp9 rather than through formation of a disulfide bridge it is intriguing that mutation of the g98 residue to an asp totally blocks the dimerization and rna-binding activity of the protein as explained no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with g98d mutant transcripts evidence present suggests that g98d mutation may lead to the disruption of subgenomic rna transcription and the protein is therefore directly involved in the viral replication as the rna-binding assay used in this study involves binding of rna probes to the denatured momomeric form of the nsp9 protein it is quite unlikely that the loss of rna-binding activity for this mutant is the direct consequence of destabilization of the nsp9 homodimer by this point mutation one possibility is that the c-terminal domain is directly involved in the binding of rna alternatively this point mutation may alter the overall folding of the protein nsp9 protein is a nucleic acid-binding protein the structural characteristics of nsp9 suggested that its nucleic acid-binding activity is not strictly sequence-specific egloff et al 2004 sutton et al 2004 the nsp9 protein may bind rna through wrapping of the ssrna around the nsp9 dimer egloff et al 2004 sutton et al 2004 in this study we show that mutations of some positively charged residues in the -barrel regions could significantly reduce the rna-binding activity of the protein however introduction of the same mutations into the viral genome showed only mild or moderate effects on the growth and infectivity of the rescued mutant viruses though positive correlation between the lowered binding activity and the reduced infectivity of the mutant viruses was observed it seems that mutations that destabilized the nsp9 homodimer render more profound effect on ibv infectivity than mutations that reduced the rna-binding activity of the protein per se we are currently uncertain if this may reflect the limitation of the assay used to analyze the rna-binding activity of the protein in the study on the other hand it would suggest that formation of the nsp9 homodimer may play functions not directly related to the rna-binding activity of the protein one possibility is that dimerization of the protein may facilitate its interaction with other viral replicase proteins or host cell proteins involved in the viral replication cycle nsp9 is a putative component of the replication complex in cells infected with mhv nsp9 is localized in the perinuclear region together with other proteins of the replication complex bost et al 2000 rdrp was shown to coimmunoprecipitate with 3clpro nsp8 and nsp9 brockway et al 2003 biophysical evidence has also been presented for an interaction between nsp9 and nsp8 of mhv sutton et al 2004 interaction between other replicase proteins was also documented for example a co-crystal structure of sars-cov nsp7 with nsp8 revealed a complex of eight monomers of each protein forming a hollow cylindrical structure this hexadecameric assembly was proposed to be able to encircle an rna template possibly acting as a processivity factor for the rna polymerase zhai et al 2005 structural analysis indicated that nsp9 may play multiple roles in coronavirus replication cycle and its interaction with other proteins may be essential for the formation of the viral replication complex together with its ability to interact with rna egloff et al 2004 sutton et al 2004 however we were unable to demonstrate direct interaction between ibv nsp9 and the two putative essential components of the replication complex rdrp and rna helicase in the overexpression system data not shown it suggests that formation of the replication complex may involve other viral and host cell components including the viral rna template further study would be required to address this interesting issue hela and vero cells were

leibowitz l   coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses that contain a genomic rna from 2632 kb in length lai and cavanagh 1997 coronaviruses have been divided into four genera based on antigenic and sequence comparisons siddell 1995 mouse hepatitis virus mhv one of the most extensively studied coronaviruses is a 32 kb betacoronavirus britton 2008 cells infected with mhv contain genomic rna and six to seven subgenomic mrnas that make up a 3 co-terminal nested set leibowitz et al 1981 van der born 2008 analysis of deletion mutants of mhv defective interfering di rnas indicated that di replication requires cis-acting elements located within the 3 terminal 436 nucleotides of the virus kim et al 1993 lin and lai 1993 this 436 nts region extends upstream of the 301 nts 3 utr into the nucleocapsid n protein gene subsequent studies demonstrated that in the context of the entire virus the n protein gene can be moved to a different part of the genome with no effect on virus replication implying that the 3 utr contains all the 3 cis-acting sequences necessary for this process de haan et al 2002 goebel et al 2004 multiple studies have been performed to determine the rna secondary structures present in the 3utr and their functional role in viral replication goebel et al 2004 goebel et al 2007 hsue et al 2000 hsue and masters 1997 johnson et al 2005 liu et al 2001 liu et al 1997 williams et al 1999 yu and leibowitz 1995a yu and leibowitz 1995b zust et al 2008 initial studies of the mhv 3utr rna secondary structure predicted three stem-loop structures in the 3-most 171 nts of the genome excluding the polya tail yu and leibowitz 1995b subsequently the hsue and masters also examined the secondary structure of the 3utr and predicted that the 5 68 nts of the 3 utr folded into a bulged stem-loop required for viral replication hsue and masters 1997 biochemical studies supported this bulged stem-loop structure and suggested that it was necessary for rna replication although the terminal loop and the first internal loop near the base of the stem were found to be larger than originally thought hsue et al 2000 hsue and masters 1997 williams et al williams et al 1999 examined the 3utr in bovine coronavirus and reported evidence for a phylogenetically conserved pseudoknot this pseudoknot encompasses nts 238-185 note that the 3-most nucleotide upstream of the polya tail is position 1 in this numbering scheme with numbers ascending in the 5 direction in mhv and its 5 stem overlaps with the last segment of the upstream bulged stem-loop positions 301224 in mhv making the two secondary structures in part mutually exclusive this led to the hypothesis that these two structures may be alternate conformers of the same region of genomic rna and constitute a molecular switch hsue et al 2000 a genetic analysis using viral mutants isolated by targeted recombination supports this hypothesis goebel et al 2004 a study examining the secondary structure of the last 166 nucleotides of the 3utr a region downstream of the pseudoknot predicted a long multi-branch stem loop in this region of the genome a model that was largely supported by enzymatic probing of rna secondary structure liu et al 2001 di rna replication assays supported a functional role for several stems in this structure subsequent re-examination of this data favored a somewhat different conformation for the last 42 nucleotides in the 3utr johnson et al 2005 a series of di rna replication assays showed that mutations within this region nts 42-1 that disrupted atw3 and atw5 or restored atw a predicted stem in this region prevented the accumulation of di rnas johnson et al 2005 when these same mutations atw atw3 and atw5 were introduced into the 3utr of the complete viral genome only the atw mutation was lethal viruses containing the atw3 and atw5 mutations grew almost as well as wild type virus in a one-step growth curve experiment although they did produce significantly smaller plaques than wild type johnson et al 2005 goebel et al goebel et al 2007 demonstrated that a hyper variable bulged stem loop spanning nts 46156 was not essential for mhv replication even though this otherwise poorly conserved region contains a highly conserved octanucleotide sequence present in virtually all coronaviruses boursnell et al 1985 and proposed a secondary structure model of the complete mhv 3utr goebel et al 2004 goebel et al 2007 based in part on sequence co-variation zust et al zust et al 2008 subsequently revised the 3 region of this model see
fig 1 to reflect potential conserved base pairings present in viruses representing all three coronavirus subgroups although the phylogenetic conservation of the proposed secondary structural model is persuasive and suggests that the proposed secondary structures are functionally important a genetic test of the functional importance of this structure was not performed we report here a functional analysis of the rna secondary structure model proposed by zust et al zust et al 2008 we utilized reverse genetic approaches to experimentally test this model through mutagenesis of the novel s3 and s4 stems see fig 1 predicted by this model mutations opening up s3 were lethal but large disruptions in s4 generated both viable and lethal mutants genomes carrying the original mutations in s3 or s4 plus compensatory mutations that restored base pairing in these stems were all viable and had robust growth phenotypes overall our results support the zust model for the coronavirus 3utr and suggest that the s3 stem is required for virus viability whereas at least some mutations that disrupt the s4 stem can be tolerated in the zust et al model of the mhv 3utr zust et al 2008 nucleotides 0 to 9 note that the 5-most a of the polya tail is designated as position 0 are base paired with the l1 loop of the pseudoknot to form a helical stem labeled s3 in fig 1a nucleotides 1829 are base-paired s4 in fig 1a with sequences downstream of the pseudoknot stem s2 in an earlier study of protein interacting sequences in the 3utr johnson et al 2005 three mutations that mapped to s3 andor s4 see fig 1 in the zust et al model of the mhv 3utr zust et al 2008 were examined for their effects on replication these mutations originally named atw3 atw5 and atw johnson et al 2005 have been renamed as a b and ab in the current study to increase clarity see fig 1b and c when these three mutations are introduced into the genomic rna genomes containing the a and b mutations lead to viable viruses however the genome containing the ab mutation is lethal johnson et al 2005 based on our earlier results with the a b and ab mutants we hypothesized that the presence of either of the two stems is sufficient for a viable virus but disruption of both stems is lethal to investigate this hypothesis and to perform a genetic test of the zust secondary structure model of the 3utr we made a series of additional mutations targeting s3 and s4 mutations c and d were designed to destabilize s3 and s4 respectively mutation cd destabilizes both s3 and s4 fig 1b mutations that affected both sides of s3 and s4 were designated abd abc and abcd fig 1c when mutations c d abc and abd which destabilize base-pairing in either the s3 d abc or s4 c abd helices were introduced into the genomic rna they all produced viable virus with somewhat smaller plaque sizes compared to the wild type virus 
fig 2a grew with near identical kinetics to wild type virus and achieved peak titers that were at least 25 of those achieved by wild type virus fig 2b however for genomes carrying mutation cd a mutation which disrupts base-pairing in both s3 and s4 we were unable to recover virus in multiple trials thus we concluded that this mutation was lethal similar to the results we obtained with the a b and ab mutations in our previous work johnson et al 2005 furthermore when mutant abcd which restores base-pairing in stems s3 and s4 but alters the sequences of these stems was introduced into the genomic rna it was viable and generated a virus that forms plaques almost identical in size to those formed by wild type virus grew with nearly identical kinetics to wild type virus and achieved a peak titer nearly identical to that of wild type virus fig 2a and b these results are entirely consistent with the zust model zust et al 2008 of the 3utr and our hypothesis that base-pairing in either s3 or s4 are necessary for mhv viability we had previously demonstrated that mhv genomes carrying the lethal ab mutation are unable to direct the synthesis of subgenomic rna although they are able to direct the synthesis of a minus sense complement of the genome johnson et al 2005 to determine the rna species that might have been generated in cells electroporated with genomes containing the cd mutation we performed nested rt-pcr assays to detect negative-strand genomic rna and negative-strand subgenomic rna3 and mrna6 these rnas serve as templates for genomic and subgenomic mrna synthesis pasternak et al 2003 sawicki and sawicki 1990 sola et al 2005 zuniga et al 2004 nested rt-pcr results showed that negative-strand genomic rnas were present in cells at 4 and 8 h after electroporation with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the cd mutation similar to what we observed after electroporation of wt genomes fig 2c in contrast neither negative-strand subgenomic rna3 nor rna6 were detected in cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the cd mutation whereas cells electroporated with wt genomes contained negative-strand subgenomic rna3 and rna6 at 8 h incubation fig 2d and e for each sample parallel rt-pcr reactions without an rt step were performed to ensure that residual dna templates taken up by the cells during electroporation did not produce pcr signals data not shown these data show that genomes carrying the cd mutation destabilizing stems s3 and s4 are defective in directing subgenomic rna synthesis the identical phenotype detected with the ab mutations on the opposing sides of the stem in our previous work johnson et al 2005 based on the above results we further tested if larger sequence disruptions in s3 or s4 affect virus viability a series of mutants e f g h eh and fg were made for this purpose 
fig 3 mutations e and h two mutants that completely disrupt s3 were lethal a mutation in the 5 side of s4 that completely disrupted this stem mutation g produced the same lethal phenotype however the mutation in the 3 side of s4 mutation f produced a viable virus all plaque isolates of f mutant virus from two independent electroporations also contained a second site mutation either a5c5 or a6c6 c5 or c6 can base-pair with g221 which is extruded in the wt s3 stem this base-pairing increased the stability of s3 in viruses we recovered containing the f mutation sequencing of the nsp8 and nsp9 coding regions of these mutants failed to reveal additional second site mutations unsurprisingly mutations that restored the s3 and s4 helices mutations eh and fg both generated viable mutants viruses eh and fg these viable mutants have smaller plaque sizes but essentially equivalent one-step growth curve compared to wild type virus 
fig 4a and c rna species present in cells electroporated with the lethal g and h mutants were analyzed by rt-pcr as described above for the ab and cd lethal mutants negative sense genomic rnas were detected when cells were electroporated with genomes containing the lethal mutants h in s3 and g in s4 however subgenomic rna synthesis is defective in these mutants fig 4d and e these results suggest that s3 is critical for virus viability with complete disruption of s3 leading to a defect in subgenomic rna synthesis and thus a lethal phenotype the disparate effects of the f viable g lethal and fg viable mutations in s4 led us to model the possible effects of these three mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3utr in mfold the mfold models suggest that the g mutant has the potential to fold into a very different structure than the wild type structure but with a similar thermodynamic stability perhaps accounting for the g mutants lethal phenotype in contrast the f mutation is predicted to simply result in local unfolding of s4 this suggests that s4 is not essential for virus viability the 8 nts that make up loop 3 l3 see fig 1a and fig 3 have a perfect palindromic sequence arrangement and led us to investigate the role of l3 if any in viral replication three mutations a loop randomized mutation lrd a mutation that shortened l3 by 2-nts lst2 and a mutation that shortened l3 by 6-nts lst6 were designed to test the functional role of l3 fig 3 interestingly these mutations all resulted in viable viruses with only minor differences in plaque size and no differences in their replication kinetics or final titer compared to wild type virus fig 4b and c this result showed that l3 likely functions as a linker between s3 and s4 with few constraints on its sequence and length 
cis-acting sequences important for controlling viral replication are typically found in the 3 and 5 utrs of rna viruses rna secondary structural features are often important in the function of these cis-acting regions in this study we have performed a functional analysis of the rna secondary structural model of the mhv 3utr originally proposed by zust et al zust et al 2008 utilizing a reverse genetics approach the conservation amongst group 2 coronaviruses of the structural elements of the 3utr namely the bulged stem-loop and overlapping pseudoknot and the conserved s3 and s4 helices connected by a variable length loop see fig 1a zust et al 2008 and the ability of other group 2 coronavirus sars-cov and bcov 3utrs with primary sequences that diverge significantly from mhv to functionally replace the mhv 3utr goebel et al 2004 hsue and masters 1997 kang et al 2006 suggests the rna secondary structure of the 3utr plays a key functional role in coronavirus replication the overlap of the most distal portion of the bulged stem-loop with the pseudoknot makes these two structures mutually exclusive this led to the hypothesis that these two structures may be alternate conformations of the same region of genomic rna and constitute a molecular switch hsue et al 2000 genetic studies demonstrated that both the pseudoknot and base-pairing of the lower region of the bulged-stem-loop were functionally important supporting this hypothesis goebel et al 2004 biophysical studies stammler et al 2011 demonstrate that the pseudoknotted conformation is much less stable than the double-hairpin conformation but suggest that stacking of the pseudoknot with the s3 helix can stabilize the pseudoknotted conformation allowing it to form mutations predicted to disrupt the s3 helix mutations e and h were both lethal whereas the double mutation eh predicted to restore the s3 helix resulted in a viable virus consistent with the idea that this stem may be necessary to allow the pseudoknotted conformation to form or is necessary for viral replication in its own right mutations in s4 predicted to disrupt this helix had differing effects mutation g in the 5 side of s4 and predicted to completely disrupt the s4 helix produced a lethal phenotype this contrasted with the mutation in the 3 side of the s4 helix mutation f which reproducibly produced a viable virus with a second site mutation in the s3 helix that stabilized this structure the double mutant fg predicted to restore the predicted structure resulted in a viable virus entirely consistent with the zust zust et al 2008 model modeling the possible effects of these three mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3utr in mfold suggests that the g mutant has the potential to cause the region containing the triple helix junction s2 s3 and s4 see fig 1 to fold into a completely different two helix structure with a similar thermodynamic stability as the wild type structure this structure lacking the s2 stem-loop and both the s3 and s4 helices would not be able to form the pseudoknotted structure or the double stem-loop structure extended bulged stem-loop plus s2-l2 stem-loop likely accounting for the g mutants lethal phenotype in contrast the f mutation is predicted to simply result in local unfolding of s4 all of the viruses we recovered with the f mutation in s4 also contained second site a5c or a6c mutations in s3 that resulted in a gc base pair replacing an au base pair thus increasing in the stability of s3 by a small amount our failure to recover viruses that contain the f mutation without any second site mutations raises the possibility that s4 interacts stacks with the s3 helix making a further necessary contribution to the stability of the 3utr particularly in the pseudoknotted configuration mutations with smaller sequence disruptions designed to separately destabilize the predicted s3 mutations a d abc or s4 mutations b c and abd helical stems were all viable whereas mutants that destabilized both of these helices mutations ab and cd were lethal a quadruple mutation abcd that maintained both s3 and s4 while altering the sequences of these stems yielded a virus with an in vitro phenotype virtually identical to that of wild type virus these results strongly support the zust zust et al 2008 model modeling the possible effects of the lethal ab and cd mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3utr in mfold suggests that the cd mutant has only one thermodynamically stable conformation in which the region containing the triple helix junction s2 s3 and s4 see fig 1 folds into a completely different structure consisting of a long bulged stem-loop linked to a shorter bulged stem-loop by a seven nucleotide single-stranded linker this structure lacking the s2-l2 stem-loop and both the s3 and s4 helices would not be able to form the pseudoknotted structure or the alternative two stem-loop structure that make up the putative molecular switch goebel et al 2004 possibly accounting for the cd mutants lethal phenotype it is less clear from our modeling of the ab mutant why it is lethal the three structures predicted by mfold all maintain the s2-l2 stem-loop with the most stable predicted structure containing an additional bulge in s4 and a somewhat reconfigured and shorter s3 helix see fig 1 these same altered s3 and s4 helices are predicted to be present singly in the a and b mutants thus the predicted structure of the ab mutant does not provide a ready explanation for its lethal phenotype it is also possible that the lethal ab and cd mutations perturb the equilibrium between the extended bulged stem-loop structure and the pseudoknotted structure to a degree that is incompatible with viability mutations disrupting the l3 loop lrd lst2 and lst6 between s3 and s4 were all viable with no apparent phenotypic differences compared to wild type virus this leads us to conclude that l3 might function as a linker between s3 and s4 with little sequence and length preference overall the genetic studies of the 3utr strongly support the zust model several alternative secondary structures for this region of the 3utr were proposed prior to the development of the current model goebel et al 2007 johnson et al 2005 liu et al 2001 our results suggest that it is unlikely that these alternative rna secondary structures have a functional role in replication and support the zust model of the 3utr zust et al 2008 zust et al zust et al 2008 introduced insertion mutations in the loop 1 l1 sequence on the 5 side of the s3 stem and recovered second site suppressor mutations in the nsp8 and nsp9 proteins in viruses recovered after limited passage based on these results these authors speculated that the l1 loop plus the s3 helix might serve as a binding site for a primase complex containing the nsp8 rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp activity imbert et al 2006 and that this complex initiates minus sense rna synthesis in this model once rna synthesis had commenced from the 3 end of the genome the base pairing in s3 would be disrupted allowing formation of the upstream pseudoknot see fig 1 enabling assembly of a complete replicase complex containing the nsp12 rna rdrp and other nsps to subsequently elongate the rna primer sequencing of the nsp8 and nsp9 coding sequences of viable mutant viruses a d and abc all containing mutations predicted to disrupt a small portion of the s3 helix failed to demonstrate second site suppressor mutations in nsp8 and nsp9 data not shown similarly sequencing of this region in all mutant f isolates failed to demonstrate second site mutations additionally the rna phenotype of all of the lethal mutations that we examined ab cd h and g figs 2c and 4e indicated that genomes with these mutations were able to direct the synthesis of negative sense rnas corresponding to the genome but were not able to synthesize negative sense templates for subgenomic rna synthesis this result is generally consistent with a model for subgenomic rna synthesis sola et al 2005 zuniga et al 2004 that hypothesized that genome circularization mediated by rnaprotein or rnarna interactions plays an important role in leader-body sequence joining during transcription of minus sense subgenomic rnas providing a role for the 3utr in subgenomic rna synthesis it should be noted that the zust zust et al 2008 and zunigasola sola et al 2005 zuniga et al 2004 models are not necessarily mutually exclusive and elements of both of them could explain the observed rna phenotype of our mutants our data does not distinguish between these two models but it does demonstrate that in either scenario the complex and very likely dynamic structure of the 3utr is necessary for discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic rnas our studies do provide data supporting the idea that the 3utr likely is a single functional unit consisting of several interacting structures we also noticed that the mhv 5utr sl1 potentially forms base-pairing interactions with 3utr s3 the 5utr sl1 sequence 5g8ugauu133 can be base paired to 3utr s3 3c1acuaa65 and 5utr sl1 5g14gcguccguac243 can be base paired to 3utr s3 3c218uguaggua ag228 5 we hypothesized that these interactions might be necessary for the genome circulization postulated by the zunigasola sola et al 2005 zuniga et al 2004 model to promote the switch between transcription and replication a series of mutations were designed to investigate these hypothesized interactions between the 5 and 3utrs and we attempted to recover infectious virus harboring these mutations these studies failed to support these hypothesized interactions data not shown additional structural and biophysical studies to determine in detail the interactions of the various structures in the entire 3utr and their dynamics are required to more fully understand their roles in viral replication murine 17cl-1 dbt

subgenomic rna production ewan plant p amy sims c ralph baric s jonathan dinman d deborah taylor r   coronaviridae along with arteriviridae and roniviridae belong to the order nidovirales viruses belonging to these families are large positive strand rna viruses and are known to infect mammals birds fish and arthropods 1 entry into a host cell is usually mediated by an interaction between the virus spike glycoprotein and a cellular receptor 2 after entry the virus disassembles and a replicationtranscription complex forms on double-membraned vesicles 3 and references within new subgenomic rna is produced by a mechanism known as discontinuous transcription 4 coronavirus replication requires the production of negative-strand rna from which positive-strand rna is produced viral proteins are produced from the positive-strand subgenomic rnas and from the positive-strand full-length rna  the two largest open reading frames orf1a and orf1ab are translated from the full-length rna these open reading frames orfs encode polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved by self-encoded proteases the proteins encoded in orf1a and orf1ab function as the replicase making subgenomic rnas and new copies of the genomic rna 5 production of the pp1ab polyprotein requires the translating ribosome to change reading frame at the frameshift signal that bridges orf1a and orf1ab like most viral frameshift signals frameshifting at the coronavirus signal leads to expression of an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp a protein essential for viral replication for review see 6 the proteins upstream of the frameshift signal include the predicted proteases and other uncharacterized proteins 5 we have previously suggested that the ratio of the pp1a and pp1ab proteins might affect the regulation and production of genomic and subgenomic rna 7 the sars coronavirus frameshift signal has a seven nucleotide slippery sequence and a stimulatory pseudoknot separated by a spacer region during programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting -1prf the trnas positioned on the slippery site uncouple from the mrna and reconnect in the new reading frame the second stem of the stimulatory pseudoknot is formed by the distal 3 sequence base-pairing with residues in the loop region of the first stem loop unlike other frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots the sars pseudoknot contains an additional internal stem loop 8910 the function of this structure called stem 3 is unknown we have shown that alterations to the sars coronavirus frameshift signal affect frameshifting efficiency 911 reduction in frameshifting efficiency is expected to result in decreased expression of the frameshift proteins including the rdrp some mutations that reduced frameshifting were associated with a several-fold reduction in the amount of genomic rna 7 unfortunately the mutations employed in prior studies altered both the nucleic acid and protein sequences making it impossible to separate the contributions of rna and protein here analyses using synonymous protein coding mutations demonstrate that the region of the genome that harbors the frameshift signal affects the regulation of genomic and subgenomic rna production without altering protein sequence we discuss possible reasons for this in an effort to further our understanding of how the sars frameshift signal functions we performed deletion and mutagenesis studies an analyzed the effects on frameshifting efficiency rna structure and viral rna production there are at least three different types of structures used by the coronaviruses to stimulate frameshifting some coronaviruses such as sars-cov use a three stemmed pseudoknot others such as human coronavirus 229e have an elaborated pseudoknot or kissing stem-loops while the avian infectious bronchitis virus utilizes a two stemmed pseudoknot 91213 that these diverse coronaviruses retain some sequence between stems 1 and 2 yet have quite different frameshift stimulating structures is intriguing one inference that can be made is that the rna sequence or a structure formed by it is involved in some other aspect of the virus lifecycle our initial hypothesis was that a regulatory element was contained within this sequence here we describe deletion and mutagenesis experiments with a dual luciferase reporter to show that the effect the sequence between stems 1 and 2 has on frameshifting efficiency is due to structural changes those mutations cause in the pseudoknot further we show by making synonomous mutations in the virus that different levels of frameshifting efficiency affect the production of genomic and subgenomic rna differently this could be caused by disruption of a regulatory element or the altered ratio of proteins derived from the coding region flanking the frameshift signal the individual residues and each stem in the sars pseudoknot make unique contributions to frameshifting efficiency 8910 for example while stem 2 is essential for frameshifting stem 3 is not even small changes in stem 2 eg replacing or deleting the bulged adenosine in stem 2 with a cytosine reduced frameshifting to levels similar to those observed with the complete disruption of stem 2 9 in contrast altering the bulged adenosine in stem 3 or disruption of stem 3 promoted only modest changes in frameshifting 9 these observations engendered the hypothesis that stem 3 formation may affect frameshifting by enhancing or facilitating the formation of stem 2  experiments were designed to test the effects of changes to the length of stem 3 while still maintaining a stable structure beginning with the wild-type stem 3 containing nine paired bases and a nine residue loop the following series of mutants were constructed first the loop capping stem 3 was replaced with a shorter tetraloop the l2tetra construct contains ten paired bases and a four residue loop this was used as the basis for construction of two additional tetraloop constructs with progressively shorter stem 3 structures l2tetras3-4bp containing only four paired bases in the stem and l2tetras3-2bp which has only two paired bases the 5-uucg-3 tetraloop sequence used in the l2tetras3-4bp mutant was selected because the last base-pair before the tetraloop affects its formation the closing pair for uncg tetraloops is usually c-g compared to the g-c closing base-pair found in cuug tetraloops all of the truncated structures promoted frameshifting at levels equal to or greater than the wild-type pseudoknot structure using a dual luciferase reporter assay figure 1 interestingly the l2tetras3-4bp mutant stimulated frameshifting at 251 compared to the 15 to 175 observed for the other stem 3 mutants it is possible that the difference in the tetraloop contributed to the slight increase in frameshifting efficiency these results and experiments reported by brierley et al for another coronavirus 12 indicate that the length of stem 3 does not play a critical role in frameshifting suggesting that it may serve some other function  while alteration of the bulged adenosine in stem 2 or disruption of stem 2 primary and secondary structures dramatically reduces frameshifting efficiency neither the bulged adenosine in stem 3 nor the sequence of stem 3 itself have similarly strong roles 911 however given the ability of tetraloop-capped stem 3 mutants to promote high levels of frameshifting we asked if these mutations could compensate for deletion of the bulged adenosine in stem 2 to this end the bulged adenosines in stems 2 and 3 were deleted both individually and together in the context of the l2tetra construct figure 2 l2tetra was chosen as the baseline because among the tetraloop mutants it most closely represents the wild-type sequence deletion of the bulged adenosine in stem 2 l2tetras2 reduced frameshifting by 842 175 versus 277 p  93  1019 figure 2 when the bulged adenosine from stem 3 was removed l2tetras3 a similar reduction of 825 was observed 175 versus 31 p  11  1019 interestingly removal of both adenosines l2tetras2s3 partially restored frameshifting with only a 282 reduction in frameshifting 175 versus 126 p  75  105 bulged adenosines which are known to bend helices 14 may be participating in formation of a functional pseudoknot structure indeed many frameshift-stimulating structures have bent conformations that are postulated to help effect frameshifting 151617 importantly however the contribution of the bulges in the sars pseudoknot is not the same in the context of the native stem 3loop 2 specifically removing both bulged adenosines s2s3 from the wild-type backbone decreased rates of frameshifting by 93 153 versus 106 p  17  1018 similar to that observed with the removal of the stem 2 bulge alone figure 2 together these results suggest that stabilization of stem 3 assists in the formation or stability of stem 2 which in turn is essential for frameshifting however the actual sequence of loop 2 or the tetraloop-capping stem 3 also affected frameshifting efficiency either through the stabilization of stem 3 or the formation of stem 2 itself thus implicating the nucleotides in loop 2 or the tetraloop in tertiary structure interactions further evidence comes from the chemical protection data below demonstrating that the altered sequence of loop 2 affects the structure of stems 2 and 3 although secondary structure predictions indicate that the nucleotides in loop 2 are not part of a helix those nucleotides are susceptible to both single- and double-strand-specific nucleases 9 suggesting that these nucleotides participate at least part of the time in some ordered structural state  while the high degree of phylogenetic conservation of stem 3 in many coronaviruses 9 suggests that it serves an important function mutations in this element have less impact on frameshifting efficiency than mutations in stem 2 91112 prior structural analyses also suggested that the stability of the structure may contribute to frameshifting efficiency here specific changes were made to stem 3 in order to directly address this issue  a negative control plasmid was constructed in which stem 2 base-pairing was disrupted s2d by mutating three residues in the third codon position so as to retain the amino acid sequence of the frameshift protein pp1ab figure 3a consistent with prior studies 91118 disruption of stem 2 resulted in a 99 reduction in frameshifting 15 versus 019 figure 3a demonstrating that the integrity of the second stem and hence the pseudoknot is required for efficient frameshifting a control plasmid l2-ucc with a synonymous mutation in loop 2 was also made the agu codon was changed to ucc because the latter is present at the same position in the tgev coronavirus and would be expected to have a minimal impact more detailed structural information about the l2-ucc mutant is published elsewhere 19 as expected a moderate change in frameshifting efficiency was observed 572 versus 15 figure 3a next a stem 3 mutant was designed to alter the structure of stem 3 yet retain the same coding sequence so that the effects of these mutations on virus propagation could also be tested in vivo figure 3c in the s3d construct stem-3 base-pairing was disrupted the observed effects in vivo should therefore reflect changes related to rna structure within the frameshifting signal rather than changes in the function of the encoded proteins the silent codon changes in s3d promoted moderate reductions in -1 prf efficiency as compared to the silent s2 mutants 395 versus 019 compare figure 3a and 3c these moderate changes are similar to the l2-ucc mutant and those observed for other stem 3 mutants 911 importantly these values are higher than 233 the lowest level of frameshifting previously observed for a viable sars coronavirus 7  to determine if the synonymous mutations altered the structure of the pseudoknot their effects on this structure were evaluated using selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension shape analysis see experimental section the negative control s2d did not form apseudoknot-like structure data not shown the l2-ucc loop is more structured than the wild-type loop and this reduced flexibility appeared to affect the remaining structure of the pseudoknot as shown by diminished reactivity to nmia at and around the mutated bases in the loop l2 compared to the wild-type structure figure 3b additionally there was decreased reactivity with some bases in stem 3 and in the loops l1 and l3 these data correlate well with prior chemical analysis showing that the nucleotides in loop 2 were susceptible to both single- and double-strand-specific nucleases 9 having established this baseline s3d and s2s3 mutants were evaluated by shape in contrast to the l2-uuc pseudoknot mutant the s3d and s2s3 pseudoknots were more reactive to nmia indicating that they are less structured figure 3d in addition to the expected changes in reactivity to the mutated bases in stem 3 bases in the 3 region of both loop 2 which caps stem 3 and the loop joining stems 2 and 3 l3 also showed increased reactivity for s3d the s2s3 mutant was also more reactive to nmia however the nmia reactivity pattern of the s3d mutant with more reactivity in the 5 proximal end of stem 3 and the 3 portion of loop 2 differed from that seen for s2s3 in which reactivity was more clustered in the 5 portion of loop 2 and adjacent stem 3 nucleotides these data suggest that the native structure of loop 2 and correct formation of stem 3 is dependent on the presence of the bulged adenosines  although most mutations in stem 3 have a limited impact on frameshifting there is evidence of sequence conservation between coronavirus sequences through this region 9 to determine the biological significance of stem 3 we tested a virus containing synonymous stem 3 mutations and a virus containing synonymous loop 2 mutations figure 4a rna was extracted from the infected cell lysate amplified by rt-pcr and sequenced to confirm that the desired mutations were present the s3d virus was viable but replicates to a lower titer than the wild type figure 4b table 1 the effect on production of genomic and subgenomic rna was quantified by rt-pcr figure 4c although the s3d virus could be detected by rt-pcr the tcid50 values were below the limit of the assay table 1 figure 4b the l2-ucc mutant was detected by both methods the rt-pcr analysis demonstrates that the genomic rna grna of l2-ucc accumulates to wild-type levels four days post-infection figure 4c in contrast genomic rna from the s3d mutant only accumulated to levels approximately three orders of magnitude lower interestingly the genomic to subgenomic rna ratios were inverted for the s3d mutant while the wild type and l2-ucc viruses had tenfold more genomic than subgenomic rna the s3d mutant had tenfold more subgenomic rna than genomic rna figure 4c similar changes in viral rna ratios were seen with viruses with mutated slippery sites implicating a broader region of this part of the genome as being involved in regulation of transcription 7 while the changes in the previous report resulted in an altered protein sequence it is unknown if the pseudoknot structure in the slippery site mutants was affected the viruses used in this study all encode identical proteins indicating that protein function itself is not causing the altered transcription patterns this suggests that the differences between the viruses are due to rna sequence andor structural changes because the rt-pcr quantification was performed on the supernatant from cells exhibiting cpe and expected to contain representative amounts of cellular grna and sgrna it is possible that the rt-pcr data could be indicative of differing amounts of grna packaged in virions the reduction in virion-associated grna levels could occur if a packaging signal was disrupted disruption of a packaging signal would result in fewer complete virions and lower tcid50 and grna values as observed for the s3d mutant although the efficiency of frameshifting is similar for the l2-ucc and s3d mutants the grna levels differ by several log the stabilization of l2-ucc stem 3 structure and loss of s3d stem 3 structure see figure 3 also support the idea that this region may contain a packaging signal construction of dual luciferase plasmids the parental plasmids pjd464 and pjd502 containing the renilla and firefly luciferase genes flanking the wild-type sars-cov frameshift signal have been described previously 9 pjd502 is the test construct for measuring frameshifting efficiency and pjd464 is a readthrough control plasmid to normalize against any defects in overall translation that the introduced sars sequence may cause site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations into the test construct pjd502 mutagenesis was performed using stratagenes quikchange ii kit la jolla ca the mutations were confirmed by sequence analyses construction of mutant viruses oligonucleotide site directed mutagenesis was used to mutate sars subclone d 20 each mutant subclone was assembled with the other five subclones and then t7 rna polymerase and a gtp cap analog were used to generate a full-length virus transcript as described previously 20 full-length genomic rna was transfected into vero cells resulting in a productive lytic viral infection the virus was allowed to grow for 5 days at 37 c viral supernatants were plated onto vero cells and several clones were plaque purified the plaque-purified viruses were expanded by growth on vero cells rt-pcr was used to detect subgenomic rna a marker of viral replication pcr amplicons from the frameshift region were sequenced to verify that the correct mutations were introduced virus titer was measured using a tcid50 assay calculated according to the method of reed and muench 21 all viral assays were conducted in bsl-3 safety facilities the abundance of grna and sgrna was determined by quantitative real-time pcr using sybr green technology as previously described 7 primers complementary to grna and sgrna were used to detect rna although the primers complementary to the sgrna can anneal to the grna only the smallest sgrna has the 5 leader and 3 sequence close enough to allow pcr amplification under normal cycling conditions rna structure probing the structures of the pseudoknots were probed using the selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension shape procedure of wilkinson et al 22 shape analysis utilizes n-methylisatoic anhydride nmia which tests the local backbone flexibility of rna more flexible nucleotides assume conformations that are reactive to nmia which irreversibly acylates the ribose 2-hydroxyl groups this then presents as a stop upstream of the modified base during primer extension thus a more intense band in the primer extension autoradiograph represents a more flexible region of the rna briefly dna was amplified from each mutant plasmid using pcr master mix fermentas inc glen burnie md and a forward-direction primer containing the t7 rna promoter t7forshape 5-taatacgactcactatagggaagatgcacctgatgaaatgg-3 and the reverse-direction primer revshape 5-gcccatatcgtttcatagcttc-3 rna was synthesized from the pcr products using the ambion t7 megascript kit austin tx as per the manufacturers instructions rna 2 pmol in a volume of 12 l was denatured at 95 c and cooled on ice reaction buffer 6 l containing 333 mm hepes 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ph 80 20 mm mgcl2 and 222 mm nacl was added to each rna sample and the mixture was incubated at 37 c for 20 minutes the reactions were split into two equal aliquots one with 1 l dimethyl sulfoxide the other with 1 l of 65 mm n-methylisatoic anhydride nmia and incubated at 37 c for 45 minutes the rna was then precipitated with 90 l h2o 4 l 5m nacl 1 l 20 mgml glycogen 2 l 100 mm edta ph 80 and 350 l ethanol overnight at 80c after centrifugation the rna was resuspended in 14 l of 05  te the oligonucleotide 5-gccgggcctttctttatg-3 50 pmol integrated dna technology coralville ia was

separated on an 8 polyacrylamide 75m urea gel in tbe buffer dried and visualized by phosphorimage analysis dual luciferase assays for each assay cells were transfected with either a test plasmid or a control plasmid described above using fugene6 from promega madison wi veroe6 cells were grown overnight in dulbeccos modified eagle medium supplemented with 10 fbs at 37 c cells were disrupted using the passive lysis buffer promega madison wi as per the manufacturers instructions luminescence reactions were initiated by addition of 10  20 l of cell lysates to 100 l of the promega lar ii buffer and completed by addition of 100 l stopnglo reagent luminescence was measured using a turner design td2020 instrument at least three replicates were performed within each assay and all assays were repeated at least three times until the data were normally distributed to enable statistical analyses both within and between experiments the frequency of frameshifting is expressed as a ratio of firefly to renilla luciferase from a test plasmid divided by the analogous ratio from the read-through control plasmid multiplied by 100 fold change standard error and estimates of the p-values for ratiometric analyses were performed as described previously 23 in line with previous studies of coronavirus frameshift signals data presented here indicate that the sequence and length of the third stem is not critical for frameshifting efficiency 91218 however as revealed by the structural analysis mutations in stem 3 can cause changes in frameshift efficiency by changing stem 2 formation additionally changes in stem 3 can be detrimental to viral viability specifically changes that destabilize stem 3 resulted in reductions in -1 prf and altered patterns of viral rna production it remains to be determined if the latter change is due to a disruption in frameshifting or disruption of a rna regulatory element such as a packaging signal while many sequences involved in coronavirus subgenomic rna synthesis have been elucidated sequences and structures involved in regulating coronavirus genomic rna synthesis are less well defined 24 internal replication elements have been described in other plus-strand non-segmented viruses including poliovirus hepatitis c virus and tombusviridae 252627 each of these internal replication elements is present in the region of the viral genome encoding non-structural proteins the tombusviridae rna-dependent rna polymerase is translated as a readthrough product and the internal replication element is downstream of the readthrough signal 25 although the cre element from poliovirus has been studied for several years the precise roles of these elements are not well defined 28 in most instances it is not known for example if they bind to specific viral or host proteins or if they communicate with other elements in the genome packaging signals for coronaviruses are also ambiguous and have been identified in the 5 untranslated regions and the 3 end of orf1ab 2930 our work demonstrated that a less structured stem 3 in the frameshift pseudoknot led to significantly reduced amounts of grna when compared to viruses with more structured pseudoknots however the same change in viral rna patterns was observed with a slippery site mutant suggesting that if a packaging signal is present it extends from or is affected by the upstream slippery site the correlation between stem 3 structure and grna levels indicates that a structural requirement in stem 3 is required for optimal rna production but we cannot at this stage rule out a frameshifting threshold similar to that observed for the yeast double-stranded rna virus m1 31 that is if frameshifting drops below a certain frequency the change in the ratio of pp1a to pp1ab results in a dramatic reduction in grna production indeed recent reports describing the function of a nonstructural protein nsp8 encoded upstream of the frameshift signal provide an alternative hypothesis to regulatory element hypothesis investigated in this work nsp8 was initially described as a non-canonical rna-dependent rna polymerase and produced as part of the pp1a protein whether or not frameshifting occurs 32 in contrast the canonical rdrp nsp12 is produced as part of the pp1ab protein only if frameshifting occurs this in conjunction with our data suggests that the nsp8 polymerse might direct sgrna production and that the rdrp encoded in nsp12 is predominantly used for grna production it has been hypothesized that coronavirus rna synthesis involves structurally and functionally separable rna synthesising complexes 33 the nsp7nsp8 complex from three different coronaviruses have recently been shown to have primer-independent rna polymerase activity 3334 in contrast to the nsp12 rdrp which is primer dependent 35 currently the details regarding coronavirus rna synthesis are very limited and do not explain how the polymerases distinguish between templates or prime synthesis te velthuis and colleagues suggested that the separate rdrps may influence plus and minus strand synthesis 33 but our results indicate that the division might be between genomic and subgenomic rna synthesis the rt-pcr for detection of grna and sgrna in our study generated a cdna intermediate using random hexamers and because of this the analyses performed here do not distinguish between the production of positive- and negative-strands nor between mrna and sgrna thus we do not know if the regulatory sequences or proteins regulating genomic rna production act upon the positive- or negative-strand replication intermediates or transcription intermediates a slight difference in frameshifting efficiency such as that between the l2-ucc and s3d mutants would not be expected to have such significant effects on viral rna levels similar to previously described viruses containing mutations in the slippery site of the frameshift signal 7 here we show that mutations to the sars-cov frameshift stimulating mrna pseudoknot can also affect the production of viral genomic rna in both instances the abundance of viral genomic rna was reduced to 10-fold lower levels than the subgenomic rna and several orders of magnitude below that of the wild-type virus it is not clear if this result is due to a change in the abundance of grna available to be transcribed to sgrna or if it is attributable to other factors such as interactions between the grna and other proteins or rna elements as discussed above it is also possible that the synonymous changes altered the rate of translation andor the folding of the rdrp 36 which in turn could have affected production of genomic andor subgenomic rna regardless of the mechanism our observations provide a backdrop against which new questions about coronvirus replication and transcription may be explored  decoding sars-cov-2 transmission and evolution and ramifications
for covid-19 diagnosis vaccine and medicine rui wang yuta hozumi changchuan yin guo-wei wei   the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has posed crucial
threats to public health and the world economy since it was detected in
wuhan china in december 201915 as of june 1 2020
6 057 853 cases of covid-19 have been reported in more than
200 countries and territories resulting in more than 371 166
deaths27 however there have been no signs of
slowing down nor relief at this monument partially due to the fact there are
no specific anti-sars-cov-2 drugs and effective vaccines sars-cov-2 is a positive-strand rna virus that belongs to the beta coronavirus
genus the genomic information underpins the development of antiviral
medical interventions prophylactic vaccines and viral diagnostic tests
the first sars-cov-2 genome was reported on january 5 202028 it has a genome size of 2999 kb which encodes for
multiple nonstructural and structural proteins the leader sequence and
orf1ab encode nonstructural proteins for rna replication and transcription
among various nonstructural proteins viral papain-like pl proteinase
main protease or 3cl protease rna polymerase and endoribonuclease are
the common targets in antiviral drug discovery yet it typically takes more
than ten years to put an average drug to the market the downstream regions
of the genome encode structural proteins including spike s protein
envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein
notably s-protein uses one of its two subunits to bind directly to the host
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 enabling virus entry into
host cells29 the n protein one of the most abundant
viral proteins can bind to the rna genome and is involved in replication
assembly and host cellular response during viral infection13 as a virulence factor the e protein is a small integral
membrane protein that regulates cell stress response and apoptosis and
promotes inflammation4 the structural protein
especially the s protein is the candidate antigen for vaccine and antibody
drug development developing safe and effective vaccines is urgently needed
to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 however it typically takes over one
year to design and test a new vaccine furthermore the replication in rna
viruses such as influenza a is subject to errors14
except nidoviruses coronaviruses a kind of nidoviruses have the ability
to proofread their genomes during their genetic replication and
recombination6 therefore sars-cov-2 might not
mutate as fast as influenza a viruses do but still has heterogeneous and
dynamic populations the sars-cov-2 genome undergoes rapid mutations that
are partially stimulated as a response to the challenging immunological
environments arising from its transmission to the covid-19 patients of
different races ages and medical conditions the vaccine developed at one time may not be effective for mitigating the
infection by new mutated virus isolates an alarming fact is that many of
these mutations may devastate the ongoing effort in the development of
effective medicines preventive vaccines and diagnostic tests accurate
identification of the antigens and their mutations represents the most
important roadblock in developing effective vaccines against covid-19 for
example different vaccines are needed for various geographic locations due
to predominant mutations in the corresponding regions in covid-19
diagnosis the diagnostic kits are designed using two major methods
serological tests and molecular tests serological tests are to detect
specific neutralizing antibodies from covid-19 infections molecular
diagnoses look for specific covid-19 pathogenic genes which usually rely on
the polymerase chain reaction pcr because of the fast mutations of the
sars-cov-2 genome genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 may optimize the pcr
primer design to detect sars-cov safely and to reduce the risk of
false-negatives caused by genome sequence variations in addition the
genotyping analysis may also reveal those highly conserved regions with very
few mutations which can be selected as a target sequence for clinical
diagnosis and effective drug therapy the evolution pattern through the highly frequent mutations of sars-cov-2 can
be observable on short time scales in the early infection period ie
february 2020 the sars-cov-2 variants were clustered as s and l
types23 recent genotyping analysis reveals a large
number of mutations in various essential genes encoding the s protein the n
protein and the rna polymerase in the sars-cov-2 population30 monitoring the evolutionary patterns and spread dynamics
of sars-cov-2 is of great importance for covid-19 control and
prevention mutations occur in many different ways some mutations occur randomly other
mutations are enforced by the host immune system surveillance which induces
viral responses the most preserved mutations and viral evolution can be
regarded as the result of the dynamic equilibrium between the random
perturbation host cell defense and viral fitness therefore the faster
and wider the sars-cov-2 spread the more frequent and diverse the mutations
will be the tracking and analysis of covid-19 dynamics transmission and
spread are of paramount importance for winning the ongoing battle against
covid-19 genetic identification and characterization of the geographic
distribution intercontinental evolution and global trends of sars-cov-2
are the most effective approaches for studying covid-19 genomic epidemiology
and offer the molecular foundation for region-specific sars-cov-2 vaccine
design drug discovery and diagnostic development16 for
example different vaccines for the shell can be designed according to
predominant mutations this work provides the most comprehensive genotyping to reveal the transmission
trajectory and spread dynamics of covid-19 to date based on genotyping
15 140 sars-cov-2 genomes from the world as of june 1 2020 we trace
the covid-19 transmission pathways and analyze the distribution of the
subtypes of sars-cov-2 across the world we use k-means
methods to cluster sars-cov-2 mutations which provides updated molecular
information for the region-specific design of vaccines drugs and
diagnoses our clustering results show that globally there are at least
six distinct subtypes of sars-cov-2 genomes while in the us there are
four significant sars-cov-2 genotypes we introduce mutation
h-index and mutation ratio to characterize
conservative and nonconservative proteins and genes we unveil the
unexpected nonconservative genes and proteins rendering a warning for the
current development of diagnostic tests preventive vaccines and
therapeutic medicines tracking the sars-cov-2 transmission pathways and analyzing the spread
dynamics are critical to the study of genomic epidemiology
temporospatially clustering the genotypes of sars-cov-2 in the
transmission provides insights into diagnostic testing and vaccine
development in disease control in this work we retrieve and genotype
15 140 sars-cov-2 isolates from the world as of june 1 2020
there are 8309 single mutations in 15 140 sars-cov-2 isolates
based on these mutations we classify and track the geographical
distributions of 15 140 genotype isolates by
k-means clustering the sars-cov-2 genotypes
represented as single nucleotide polymorphism snp variants are
clustered as six groups in the world including the us in
particular the genotypes in the us are further clustered into four
groups table 1 lists the
co-mutations with the highest number of descendants in different
clusters in the world optimal clustering groups are established using
the elbow method in the k-means clustering algorithm

highcharts the colors blue red yellow and green represent
clusters a b c and d respectively the base color of each state
corresponds to its dominant cluster we note that cluster d in the
us is derived from cluster v in the world with an additional
mutation at the leader sequence 241 the high spread in new york is
consistent with the high transmission of sars-cov-2 in european
countries where the subtype in cluster v is predominant figures 3 and 4 depict the distribution and frequencies of
snp mutations of sars-cov-2 isolates from 15 140 genome
samples in the world with respect to the reference genome of
january 5 2020 the statistics of single mutations on various
sars-cov-2 proteins that occurred in the recorded genomes
between january 5 2020 and june 1 2020 are listed in table 5 the spike
protein has the highest number of mutations on gene of 1004
while the envelope protein has the lowest number of mutations of
52 since the sizes of proteins vary dramatically from 1273 for
the spike protein to 75 for the envelope protein it is useful
to consider the mutation ratio ie the number of mutations
per residue in this category the rna-dependent rna polymerase
has the lowest score of 0217 whereas the nucleocapsid protein
has the highest score of 0400 ie 503 mutations on its 1257
nucleotides 419 residues note that main protease has the
second-lowest mutation ratio of 0221 indicating its
conservative nature another relatively conservative protein
judged by the mutations ratio in terms of gene is the envelope
protein the mrgene  0231 counting the number of single mutations and mutation ratio does not
reflect the fact that some mutations occur numerous times over
genome samples while other mutations may happen only on a few
genome samples to account for the frequency effect of
mutations we introduce a mutation h-index to
measure both the number of mutations and the frequency of
mutations of a given protein or genetic section it is defined
as the maximum value of h such that the given
protein genetic section has h single mutations
that have each occurred at least h times it is
very interesting to note from table 5 that the mutation
h-index correlates very well with the
number of mutations on gene the pearson correlation coefficient
is 0711 specifically n protein has both the highest
mrgene of 0400 and the highest
h-index of 33 suggesting that it is the
most nonconservative protein in sars-cov-2 genomes in contrast
the envelope protein has the third-lowest number of mutations
per residues of 0231 and the lowest h-index of
9 indicating its relatively conservative nature by combining
the number of mutations per residue and the mutation
h-index we report that the most
conservative sars-cov-2 proteins is the envelope it is found
that the most nonconservative sars-cov-2 proteins are 1 the
nucleocapsid protein 2 the spike protein and 3 the
papain-like protease the number of mutations in terms of gene nmgene and
the number of mutations in terms of protein nmpro
we reported are accumulated numbers that from all of the
15 140 genome isolates if we focus on the single genome
isolate the maximum number of mutations on the whole genome
sequence is 24 real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr is routinely used in the qualitative
detection of nucleic acid from sars-cov-2 for diagnostic testing
covid-19324 the primers used in the
rrt-pcr are critical for the precise diagnosis of covid-19 and
the discovery of new strains the primer sequences are specially
designed for amplifying the conserved regions across the
different existing strains for high specificity and sensitivity
and also are subject to genotype changes as the sars-cov-2
coronavirus evolves in diagnostic testing covid-19 many
rrt-pcr primers are designed to detect for three perceived
conservative sars-cov-2 regions 1 rna-dependent rna
polymerase rdrp gene in orf1ab region 2 the e protein gene
and 3 the n protein gene3 our genotyping
statistics given in table 5 indicate that the nucleocapsid protein is the
worst choice among the four structural proteins of sars-cov-2 the spike surface
glycoprotein s of 1273 amino acid residues nucleocapsid
protein n of 419 amino acid residues membrane protein m of
222 amino acid residues and envelope protein e protein of 75
amino acid residues the s protein is the most divergent with
1004 unique mutations among the 15 140 sars-cov-2
genomes the n protein has 503 unique mutations and the
envelope e protein has 52 mutations considering the lengths
of the proteins all the four structural proteins undergo many
mutations the rdrp gene which is often used in diagnostic
testing covid-19 also has 607 mutations therefore all three regions in the routine rrt-pcr target namely
rdrp the n protein gene and the e protein genes have
significant mutations precise and robust diagnosis tools must
be re-established according to the conserved regions and
predominated mutations in the sars-cov-2 genomes detailed in the
supporting information vaccines are mostly associated with the s protein compared to
sars-cov sars-cov-2 has a unique furin cleavage site where
four amino acid residues prra are inserted into the
s1s2 junction region 681684 of the s
protein25 the furin cleavage site is
crucial for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-27 this study reveals crucial mutations near the
s1s2 junction region in the s protein including
23403ag-d614g 23422ct-v620v 23575ct-c671c
23586ag-q675r 23611ga-r683r 23707ct-p715p
23731ct-t723t 23849tc-l763l and
23929ct-y789y moreover these mutations of the s protein
sars-cov-2 are located at the epitope region corresponding to
the regions 469882 and 599620 in
sars-cov19 additionally many mutated amino acids are on the receptor-binding
domain rbd of the s protein as shown in figure 5 unfortunately the s
protein is the second most nonconservative protein in the genome
based on the number of mutations per residue and mutation
h-index in fact about half of the
receptor-binding domain residues of the s proteins have had
mutations in the past few months as shown in figure 6 because the surface
accessibility of epitope is also important for the interaction
of antibody and antigen these mutations are critical for the
antigenicity of the s protein convalescent covid-19 patients show a neutralizing antibody
response after infection which is directed mostly against the s
protein18 the neutralizing antibody
responses against sars-cov-2 could give some defense against
sars-cov-2 infection thus having implications for preventing
sars-cov-2 outbreaks the divergence of s proteins and the
nonconserved regions of the s proteins might contribute to the
antigenicity the highly frequent mutations identified in the s
protein may reduce the durability of the sars-cov-2
vaccines immunity or undermine the current development
of vaccines the existing mutations must be considered when
designing a new vaccine additionally a cocktail of multiple
vaccines has a better chance of preventing covid-19
infections unfortunately there is no specific effective drug for sars-cov-2
at this point potential drugs include small-molecular drugs and
antibody drugs much of the effort in small-molecular drug
discovery focuses on sars-cov-2 nonstructural proteins among
the major nonstructural proteins of sars-cov-2 the main
protease of 306 amino acids has 78 mutations with 0255
mutations per residue and the mutation h-index
of 16 rna polymerase of 932 amino acids has 228 mutations with
0245 mutations per residue and the mutation
h-index of 21 and papain-like protease of 945
amino acids has 105 mutations with 0333 mutations per residue
and the mutation h-index of 10 in fact the
main protease is the most popular drug target because there are
no similar known genes in the human genome which implies that
sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors will likely be less
toxic10 the present study suggests
that the main protease is the second most conservative protein
therefore it remains the most attractive target for drug
discovery therapeutic antibodies got started from cancer treatments and now
applies to infectious diseases by targeting pathogens1 antibody drugs are highly specificity and
versatile in the treatment of infectious diseases their working
principle involves the host immune system the time used to
develop antibody therapeutics are usually considerably shorter
than that used to develop a vaccine many sars-cov-2 antibody
drugs are isolated from patient blood and target the s proteins
although there many binding sites on the s protein that
antibodies can target the ones that are most effective in
neutralizing sars-cov-2 block the receptor-binding domain rbd
of the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2
receptor the rbd is a dongle-shape protein at the end of the
viruss spikes as mentioned above there are many
mutations on the s proteins the rbd is also prone to mutations
some mutations that break hydrogen bonds andor salt bridges in
antibodyantigen interactions will have a large impact
however silent mutations such as those that replace
hydrophobic residues with other hydrophobic residues will
typically have little effect to avoid the failure of one
specific antibody the cocktail treatments that include several
different antibodies might be required to treat sars-cov-2 that
undergoes antigenic mutations the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein or s protein comprised of
two subunits s1 and s2 of very different
properties25 see figure 5 among
them the s1 subunit as shown in figure
5 contains the
receptor-binding domain rbd responsible for binding to
the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
ace2 the rbd is also the common binding domain for
antibodies the s2 subunit offers the structural support
of the s protein and mediates fusion between the viral and
host cell membranes after the fusion the virus releases
the viral genome into the host cell the s1 rbd protein plays key parts in the induction of
neutralizing-antibody and t-cell responses as well as
protective immunity however s2 and extracellular domain
ecd of spike protein and their combination are commonly
used in recombinant proteins in sars-cov-2 antibody
development as shown in table 5
the s protein is the most heterogeneous structural protein
with a significant number of mutations as shown in figures 5 and
6 and table 6 the divergence of the spike
protein the nonconserved regions of the spike protein
might contribute to the antigenicity difference in
sars-cov-2 isolates we found that most of the high
frequent mutations of the s protein are located in the s1
subunit figure 6
indicates that near half of the amino acid residues have
had mutations since january 5 2020 one of the important
mutations at s1 is 23010tc v483a within the rbd for
ace2 binding and the total frequency of 23010tc
v483a is 23 the structural study revealed that the
amino acids 442487 in the s1 subunit may impact
viral binding to human ace2926
the mutations identified in this study imply the change in
ace2 binding affinity and the transmissibility of
sars-cov-2 as well as negative impacts in preventive
vaccine and diagnostic test development sars-cov-2 main protease or 3cl protease is essential for
cleaving the polyproteins that are translated from the
viral rna10 it operates at multiple
cleavage sites on the large polyprotein through the
proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and plays
a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication
sars-cov-2 main protease is one of the most attractive
targets for anti-cov drug design because its inhibition
would block viral replication and it is unlikely to be
toxic due to no known similar human proteases another
reason for the focused drug discovery efforts in
developing sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors is that
this protein is relatively conservative as shown in table 5 figure 7 illustrates
the main protease mutation patterns figure 8 further highlights
the inhibitor binding domain bd indeed the main
protease is relatively conservative compared to the spike
protein table 7
lists top 10 mutations and their frequency in our data
set it is interesting to see that many mutations such as
d176d r298r n151n are degenerate ones one possible
explanation is that nondegenerates may be nonsilent and
likely cause unsurvivable disruption to the virus note
that mutation g15s mostly occurs in cluster iv mutation
r298r is restricted to cluster iv some other mutations
such as d248e a266v n151n and t45i are specific to
certain clusters nonetheless some mutations at the bd
shown in figure 8
are worth noting they can undermine the ongoing drug
discovery effort sars-cov-2 papain-like protease plpro is a cysteine
cleavage protein located within the nonstructural protein
3 nsp3 section of the viral genome17
like the main protease plpro activity is required to
cleave the viral polyprotein into functional mature
subunits and thereby contributes to the biogenesis of
the virus replication additionally plpro possesses a
deubiquitinating activity the sars plpro is also a major
therapeutic and diagnostic target as shown in table 5
the sars plpro is prone to mutations figure 9 shows that
mutations are all over the places in plpro table 8 lists the
top 10 mutations in plpro three of these mutations are
degenerate ones note that only two of the top mutations
occurred in cluster ii in contrast cluster i has many
different mutations sars rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp is an enzyme that
catalyzes the synthesis of the sars rna strand
complementarily to the sars-cov-2 rna template and is thus
essential to the replication of sars-cov-2 rna8 as one of the nonstructural proteins
rdrps are located in the early part of orf1b section like
most other rna viruses sars-cov-2 rdrps are considered to
be highly conserved to maintain viral functions and thus
targeted in antiviral drug development as well as
diagnostic tests on the other hand the sars-cov-2 rna
polymerase lacks proofreading capability and thus its
mutations are deemed to happen as shown in table 5 figure 10
illustrates the sars-cov-2 rdrp mutations since january 5
2020 surprisingly there are many mutations in sars-cov-2
rdrp table 9
describes the top 10 mutations as in other cases five of
these mutations are degenerate ones endoribo-nuclease nendou protein is a nidoviral
rnauridylate-specific enzyme that cleaves rna11 it contains a c-terminal catalytic
domain belonging to the nendou family rna processing the
nendou protein is presented among coronaviruses
arteriviruses and toroviruses the many aspects of the
detailed function and activity of sars-cov-2 nendou
protein are yet to be revealed figure 11 depicts
sars-cov-2 nendou protein mutations as in most other
sars-cov-2 proteins mutations have occurred over
different parts table 5 shows that nendou is relatively
conservative table 10 lists the top 10 high-frequency mutations
of the sars-cov-2 nendou protein that occurred in the past
few months four of these mutations are degenerate ones
the frequencies of these mutations range from 153 to 15
note that cluster vi only has one of these mutations the sars-cov-2 envelope e protein is one of
sars-covs four structural proteins as a
transmembrane protein it involves in ion channel activity
and thus facilitates viral assembly budding envelope
formation pathogenesis and release of the virus22 the e protein may not be essential for
viral replication but it is for pathogenesis figure 12
illustrates e protein as a very small pentamer with a few
mutations table 11 shows its top 10 mutations note that the
first four mutations are degenerate ones all other
mutations have relatively low frequencies as shown in
table 5
the sars-cov-2 e protein is very conservative sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid n protein2 is
another structural protein its primary function is to
encapsidate the viral genome to do so it is heavily
phosphorylated or charged and thereby can bind with
rna additionally sars-cov-2 n protein confirms the viral
genome to replicase-transcriptase complex rtc and plays
a crucial role in viral genome encapsulation therefore
it may function completely differently at different stages
of the viral life cycle sars-cov-2 n protein is
considered to be one of the most conservative sars-cov-2
proteins in the literature and is a popular target for
diagnosis of vaccine development3 the
present works shown in table 5 indicate that the sars-cov-2 n
protein is the worst target of any drug vaccine and
diagnostic development figure 13 is the illustration of
sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein mutations using
6vyo as a template table 12 presents
the top 10 mutations of the sars-cov-2 n protein since
january 5 2020 note that only 2 out of the top 10
mutations are degenerate ones which is a significantly
lower ratio than that of other proteins the frequency of
10th mutation is 78 which suggests there are many
mutations associated with these mediate-sized proteins
most top mutations occurred to clusters i iii and iv
clusters v and vi have almost none of the top 10
mutations sars-cov-2 membrane m protein is another structural protein
and plays a central role in viral assembly and viral
particle formation it exists as a dimer in the virion and
has certain geometric shapes to enable certain membrane
curvature and binding to nucleocapsid proteins similar to
other sars-cov proteins m protein is also a popular
target for viral diagnosis and vaccines table 5 gives
sars-cov-2 m protein the middle ranking for its
conservation table 13 details the top 10 mutations in sars-cov-2
m protein that occurred in the past few months eight of
these mutations are degenerate clusters i and v have
relatively a few of these mutations on january 5 2020 the complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was first
released on genbank access number nc0455122 by zhangs
group at fudan university28 since then there has
been a rapid accumulation of sars-cov-2 genome sequences in this
work 15 140 complete genome sequences with high coverage of
sars-cov-2 strains from the infected individuals in the world have
been downloaded from the gisaid database20 httpswwwgisaidorg as
of june 1 2020 all the records in gisaid without the exact
submission date were not taken into considerations to rearrange the
15 140 complete genome sequences according to the reference
sars-cov-2 genome multiple sequence alignment msa was carried out
by using clustal omega21 with default
parameters snp genotyping measures the genetic variations between different members
of a species establishing the snp genotyping method for the
investigation of the genotype changes during the transmission and
evolution of sars-cov-2 is of great importance by analyzing the
rearranged genome sequences snp profiles which record all of the snp
positions in teams of the nucleotide changes and its corresponding
positions can be constructed the snp profiles of a given genome of a
covid-19 patient capture all the differences from a complete reference
genome sequence and can be considered as the genotype of the
individual sars-cov-2 the jaccard distance measures dissimilarity between sample sets the
jaccard distance of snp variants is widely employed in the
phylogenetic analysis of human or bacterial genomes30 in this work we utilize the jaccard distance to
compare the difference between the snp variant profiles of sars-cov-2
genomes the jaccard similarity coefficient also known as the jaccard index is
defined as the intersection size divided by the union of two sets
a b121the jaccard distance of two sets
a b is scored as the
difference between one and the jaccard similarity coefficient and is a
metric on the collection of all finite
sets2therefore the genetic distance of
two genomes corresponds to the jaccard distance of their snp variants
if a  b

of the ordering of snp positions ie transmission trajectory when
an appropriate reference sample is selected however one may fail to
identify the infection pathways from the mutual jaccard distances of

a dimensionality reduction method is used to preprocess the

clustering is to invoke the pca to obtain a reduced-dimensional

k-means clustering in practice one can
select a few lowest dimensional principal components as the

count 4423 21 22 importance 44 coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease exon that is important for viral replication fitness 45 and virulence yet coronaviruses with a defective exon exon-aa have not reverted under 46 diverse experimental conditions in this study we identify multiple impediments to mhv-exon-47  the 3-to-5 exoribonuclease in coronavirus cov nonstructural protein 14 nsp14-exon 24 mediates rna proofreading during genome replication exon instead compensatory mutations outside of exon-aa motif i are more accessible and beneficial 49 than partial reversion we also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term 50 passage partially compensates for exon-aa motif i but renders the virus inhospitable to a 51 reverted exon our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of inactivating mutations illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between 53 coronavirus replicase proteins and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of exon-aa 54 coronavirus mutants 55 the rapid evolution of rna viruses represents a significant challenge for preventing treating 57 and eradicating rna viral diseases high mutation rates in rna viruses generate extensive 58 opportunities to overcome evolutionary hurdles such as antiviral drugs host immunity or 59 engineered attenuating changes 1 the evolutionary pathways traversed by rna viruses are 60 shaped by natural selection which will favor some evolutionary trajectories more than others 61 based on whether mutations are beneficial deleterious or neutral 2 infections and prolonged passage in tissue culture and following treatment with multiple 87 nucleoside analogues 6-11 13 14 sars-cov-exon-aa also is stable during acute and 88 persistent animal infections in immunocompetent and immune-compromised mice 12 the lack 89 of primary reversion is not due simply to reduced adaptive capacity as both sars-cov-and 90 mhv-exon-aa can adapt for increased replication 7 14 most strikingly long-term passage 91 of mhv-exon-aa 250 passages p250 yielded a highly fit population that had directly 92 compensated for defective proofreading through evolution of a likely high-fidelity rdrp 7 93 yet where primary reversion would have required just four total consensus mutations mhv-94 exon-aa-p250 contained more than 170 95 in this study we sought to determine whether specific genetic or fitness barriers prevent primary 97 reversion of exon motif i aa to this end we identified and engineered viable genetic 98 pathways towards exon-aa motif i reversion in mhv hereafter exon-aa our results show 99 that partial reversion did not confer a selective advantage compared to exon-aa further 100 exon-aa adapted within 10 passages for greater fitness than any of the intermediate revertants requires mutations to all four sites  figure 1a  viral mutation rates in the absence of 113 proofreading range from 10 -4 to 10 -6 mutations per nucleotide per round of replication  1 114 assuming an exon-aa mutation rate of 10 -4  and accounting for codon degeneracy the 115 probability of restoring the native amino acid sequence in a single round of replication is 10 -18  116 only rarely do exon-aa titers exceed 10 6 pfuml so it is unlikely that exon-aa could 117 navigate this genetic barrier in a single infectious cycle thus we hypothesized that exon-aa 118 reversion if possible would proceed incrementally to identify potential pathways towards 119 exon-aa reversion we examined the possible single-nucleotide substitutions surrounding a89 120 and a91  figure 1b  three mutations are synonymous and five mutations yield amino acids 121 unlikely to coordinate with the positively-charged metals required for exon catalysis glycine 122 valine proline threonine and serine 16 19 21 22 one mutation per site can restore the 123 acidic charge ie aa-to-ed but not the native amino acid these variants have not been tested 124 in a cov exon but biochemical studies of e coli dna polymerase i exon mutants suggest that 125 these conservative substitutions would not restore wt-like exon activity 23 we predicted 126 stepwise pathways to exon-aade reversion based on restoration of acidic charge followed 127 by reversion to native amino acids  figure 1c  we engineered and recovered variants in exon-128 aa requiring three mutations 3nt exon-ad exon-ea two mutations 2nt exon-da exon-129 ed exon-ae or one mutation 1nt exon-dd exon-ee for reversion to wt-exon-de 130 table 1  we will hereafter refer to these mutants as intermediate revertants all intermediate 131 revertants generated viable progeny during recovery demonstrating that reversion to wt-exon-132 de along these pathways is theoretically possible the 3nt and 2nt mutants were genetically 133 stable during recovery as confirmed by dideoxy sequencing however both 1nt mutants exon-134 dd and exon-ee reverted to wt-exon-de during three independent recovery attempts 135 suggesting that these two variants are less fit than wt-exon-de and demonstrating that 136 reversion by 1nt mutation is readily accessible to test whether the 3nt or 2nt mutants would 137 revert more rapidly than exon-aa 4nt we passaged three lineages of each mutant 10 times at table 1  in contrast the 2nt exon-ae contained wt-revertants by p2 145 in all lineages at moi  05 pfucell and by p8 in one lineage at moi  001 pfucell once 146 observed wt-revertants dominated the exon-ae population for the remaining passages these 147 data indicate that at least one 2nt mutation pathway can lead to full reversion in tissue culture 148 the probability of exon-ae arising during a single infectious cycle of exon-aa is low but 149 theoretically achievable 10 -9  so exon-aa could conceivably revert within just two infectious 150 cycles however complete reversion has never been observed even during prolonged passage or 151 persistent infections suggesting that additional barriers to the replication fitness or maintenance 152 of intermediate revertants exist 153  because 158 the intermediate revertants are viable as recombinants but are not found in exon-aa 159 populations we hypothesized that they confer no selective advantage over exon-aa 8 9 13 160 to test this hypothesis we first analyzed replication of the 3nt and 2nt intermediate revertants 161 profound replication or fitness defects selection could drive primary reversion more quickly 259 away from this genotype consistent with this hypothesis exon-ae reverted more quickly at a 260 higher moi where natural selection acts more efficiently on a larger population size table 1 previously 9 briefly genomic rna was detected with a 5 6-carboxyfluorescein fam and 341 3 black hole quencher 1 bhq-1 labeled probe

patterns correlate with genome organization in sars and other coronaviruses andrei grigoriev   previously cumulative skew diagrams have been employed successfully to analyze mutational patterns in various viral genomes they have been used to i link the nucleotide content changes to the genome organization replication and transcription of double-stranded dna viruses 1 ii correlate the transcriptional pattern of a bacteriophage t7 with its nucleotide content 2 and iii associate the compositional biases with mutational pressures in retroviruses 3 see box 1
on how to interpret cumulative diagramsbox 1box 1 interpreting cumulative skew diagramscumulative skew diagrams 1 7 8 can simplify the interpretation of biases in nucleotide sequence an example of such bias is gc skew which is a measure of the relative excess of guanines against cytosines on one sequence strand it is calculated as gcgc where g and c represent the occurrence of the guanines and cytosines within a specified sequence windowsuch biases have been reported for bacteria 7 20 21 and double-stranded ds dna viruses 1 21 and interpreted as evidence of asymmetry in mutation pressure because skew changes the polarity at the replication origin the gc skew has been linked to the time the dna strand spends in a single-stranded state 7 for example during replication or transcription because cytosine deamination is much faster in single-stranded ss dna compared with dsdna see 22 23 for in-depth reviews of the underlying mechanismscumulative skew represents a numerical integration of the skew value across the genome and replaces the most significant changes in polarity by global maxima and minima for example a non-cumulative plot of gc skew is shown in figure ia
for the genome of the virus sv40 where gc skew changes sign at a point near the 50 coordinate it is unclear which of the multiple local polarity switches in the middle of the plot is actually the global switch on the cumulative gc skew plot figure ib these polarity switches are seen to correspond to local minima and maxima on the gc diagram the global maximum at 54 clearly separates two genome segments with the opposite deviations from the parity gc and the slopes of the opposite linear trends on the gc diagram correspond to the respective mean gc skews for the two genome segments gc skew is positive for the leading left-hand side of the gc diagram and negative for the lagging strand as is the case with microbial genomesthe two segments of the gc diagram also correspond to the divergently transcribed coding sequences of sv40 note that the slopes of the two halves of the gc diagram are different the excess of g compared with c in the leading strand in the late mrna region of sv40 is almost half of the excess of c compared with g in the lagging strand in the early mrna region this suggests a contribution of transcription to the overall pictureeven more illustrative interplay of replication and transcription is a seen in a cumulative diagram of human papillomavirus 1
figure ic although the replication is bi-directional from 0 or 100 on the diagram transcription is unidirectional all papillomavirus genes are transcribed from one strand if there are separate biases induced by replication and transcription they should act in the same direction in one half of a papillomavirus genome and in the opposite directions in the other half this model explains the observed behavior in figure ic such that the steeper slopes on the left-hand side reflect a sum of the net contributions of replication and transcription and the right-hand side of the diagrams corresponds to their subtraction where their effects almost cancel each other out a near-horizontal cumulative plot corresponding to zero mean gc skewthe same rules apply to the analysis of rna viral genomes for example for plus-strand rna viruses the events taking place on the minus strand can be taken into account in much the same way as is done for the second strand of dsdna because gc skew measures the level of cytosine depletion on one strand relative to its complementary strand changes in the diagram shape enable researchers to infer the contribution of processes occurring on both strands even in taxonomical orders of single-stranded viruses the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov plus-strand genomic rna plus-grna consists of two distinct parts one comprising two thirds of the genome encodes the replicase polyprotein and the other encodes structural and other proteins 4 5 in this paper these parts are referred to as the long and short arm respectively strikingly there is a change in behavior of the cumulative skew diagram at the border of the arms in all coronaviruses sequenced to date six representatives are shown in figure 1 indicating a lower gc skew on the short arm this behavior suggests that biological processes that distinguish the two arms box 2 are responsible for the mutational pattern rather than the fidelity of the replication machinery the latter not would result in a constant slope of cumulative skew as is the case in retroviruses 3 the mutation rates as indicated by the extent of the cumulative skew on the y-axis do not appear to depend on a host organism skews are similar in murine avian and human 229e coronaviruses figure 1cef but substantially lower in sars-cov figure 1a table 1box 2box 2 coronavirus replication and transcription in sars-covthe genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov is a plus-strand genome rna plus-grna of 30 kbp in length translation of the replicase polyprotein on the long arm of the genome is followed by minus-grna synthesis and transcription from the short arm the long and short arms of the sars-cov genome are shown together with the transcriptional products eight subgenomic mrnas sgmrnas in figure ia
16transcription on the short arm produces a nested set of 3-coterminal sgmrnas containing at their 5-end a short leader sequence derived from the 5-end of the genome a process for one of the subgenomic mrnas is shown in figure ib
10 11 12 after a minus-strand sgmrna is synthesized on the short arm a template switch enables the completion of the synthesis of the leader sequence shown as open box on the left-hand side skipping the long armthe relative levels of transcription and replication in coronaviruses mean that subgenomic mrnas are by far the most abundant coronavirus rnas in the cell whereas the genome-length negative strand rna minus-grna is the least abundant it is 10 of the level of plus-grna 24 these levels and localization of transcriptional activity are likely to be linked to the difference in mutation rates on the short and long arms see main text the skew diagrams support the current model of coronavirus replication and transcription box 2 and gc skew is particularly illustrative in this regard because in both of these processes one rna strand is single stranded deamination of cytosine to uracil is 100 times faster in single-stranded dna compared with double-stranded dna 6 and this ratio is probably similar in rna thus cumulative gc skew can be interpreted as a measure of cytosine depletion on one strand relative to its complementary strand for most of the coronaviruses there is almost a constant excess of g compared with c throughout the long arm figure 1 indicating an elevated c to u deamination in the plus strand similar to skews observed in dna genomes 1 7 8 this probably results from the predominantly single-stranded nature of the plus-grna during replicase translation or minus-grna synthesis the skew is less pronounced on the short arm although changes in the slope of the curve are sometimes small in figure 1bf they are all significant data not shown and remarkably the cumulative diagram even reverses its trend in sars-cov figure 1a most probably this reflects higher rates of cytosine deamination on the minus-strand related to subgenomic mrna synthesis the intracellular duplex of minus-grna with plus-grna protects them from cytosine deamination if the first stage of transcription which involves subgenomic mrna template synthesis from the plus-grna leaves minus-grna on the short arm as a single strand box 2 figure i then cytosine deamination will lead to the accumulation of uracils on minus-grna subsequently synthesis of the new viral plus-grna from minus-grna will propagate these mutations depleting guanines and decreasing the overall gc skew on the short arm of the plus strand this explanation concurs with the model of subgenomic mrna synthesis from minus-strand subgenomic rna templates 9 10 for which there is experimental evidence in arteviruses 11 and murine hepatitis virus mhv 12 the rate of cytosine deamination that is related to sgmrna synthesis is likely to be proportional to the difference between the slopes of the curves in the long and short arms table 1 such a combination of mutational pressures for the two rna strands indicates a higher overall substitution rate for the short arm compared with the long arm the supporting evidence for this comes from the comparison of two bovine coronaviruses respiratory and enteric that have differences in 107 nucleotide positions 13 more than 80 of these differences correspond to the third base of a codon indicating mutational pressure i analyzed the distribution of these 107 positions and found that 59 of them localized to the short arm suggesting an 25-fold increase in polymorphisms on that arm most of these polymorphisms 85 80 correspond to a c to u substitution on one of the strands further emphasizing the role of cytosine deamination as the primary mutational force in coronaviruses the rates of cytosine deamination in the sars-cov genome appear lower compared with other coronaviruses and this might explain the observation that the two sequenced strains diverged in genomic sequence by 0003 4 5 alternatively if the epidemic came from a single clone then only a short time span separates the two strains and that might explain the low divergence furthermore the differences might be sequencing errors or pcr artifacts however it is worth pointing out that seven out of these eight polymorphisms also correspond to a c to u substitution on one of the strands comparison of the skew diagrams places sars apart from other groups of coronaviruses but does not provide any evidence of recent genomic recombination between members of those groups as the origin of sars-cov such an event would have produced a skew diagram with fragments corresponding to the parent genomes these observations are in agreement with the phylogenetic analyses of coronavirus-encoded proteins 4 5 which have also indicated lower conservation of the structural proteins compared with replicase this pattern appears to result from the mutational biases described above together with stronger selection on the replicase proteins and might influence the virulence and host-cell tropism of coronaviruses examples of altered pathogenesis have been reported for murine coronavirus mutants 14 why are the mutational trends in the sars-cov genome so different from other coronaviruses the cause is probably not in the host because another human coronavirus 229e does not appear different from the other viruses examined figure 1e could the parameters of the virus-encoded rna synthesis machinery such as the speed of replication or transcription or their relative turnover be responsible for this difference the level of cytosine deamination reflected in gc skew has been hypothesized to depend on the time a dna strand spends in a single-stranded state 1 7 8 box 1 and the same is probably true for rna although the relative contribution of transcription in sars-cov is similar to that in other coronaviruses table 1 column l-s the effect of replication is much lower table 1 column l this suggests that either minus-strand synthesis is faster or plus-strand replication is slower in sars or their relative turnover is lower compared with the synthesis of subgenomic mrna template rna all these findings are relevant for sequence-based diagnostics and drug design against sars-cov and other coronaviruses because targeting the long arm with lower mutation rates should prove more robust against mutational changes in the target this lends further support to a recent suggestion to design anti-sars drugs based on the structure of the sars 3c-like proteinase 15 which is encoded by genes on the long arm these anti-sars drugs will function as protease inhibitors that might block coronavirus replication another set of putative targets has been suggested in a recent publication 16 that has identified distant homologs of cellular rna processing enzymes in the sars genome notably these are also encoded on the long arm as parts of the replicase

sars-cov-2 has emerged as a human pathogen causing global pandemic and resulting in over 400000 deaths worldwide the surface spike protein of sars-cov-2 mediates the process of coronavirus entry into human cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 due to the critical role in viral-host interaction and the exposure of spike protein it has been a focus of most vaccines developments however the structural and biochemical studies of the spike protein are challenging because it is thermodynamically metastable 1  here we develop a new pipeline that automatically identifies mutants that thermodynamically stabilize the spike protein our pipeline integrates bioinformatics analysis of conserved residues motion dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations and other structural analysis to identify residues that significantly contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the spike protein we then utilize our previously developed protein design tool eris to predict thermodynamically stabilizing mutations in proteins we validate the ability of our pipeline to identify protein stabilization mutants through known prefusion spike protein mutants we finally utilize the pipeline to identify new prefusion spike protein stabilization mutants  the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2 3 4  which causes fever severe respiratory illness and pneumonia poses a major public health and governance challenges the emerging pathogen has been characterized as a new member of the betacoronavirus genus sars-cov-2 56  closely related to several bat coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 7 8  compared with sars-cov sars-cov-2 appears to be more readily transmitted from human to human spreading to multiple continents and leading to the world health organization whos declaration of a pandemic on march 11 2020 9  according to the who as of june 9 2020 there had been 7000000 confirmed cases globally leading to 400000 deaths in the initial step of the infection the coronavirus enters the host cell by binding to a cellular receptor and fusing the viral membrane with the target cell membrane 10 11  for sars-cov-2 this process is mediated by spike glycoprotein which is a homo-trimer 12  in the process of viruses fusing to host cells the spike protein undergoes structural rearrangement and transits from a metastable prefusion conformational state to a highly stable post-fusion conformational state 13 14  the spike protein comprises of two functional units s1 and s2 subunits when fused to the host cell the two subunits are cleaved the s1 subunit is responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 15 16 17 receptor on the host cell membrane and it contains the n-terminal domain ntd the receptor-binding domain rbd and the c-terminal domain ctd ntd in the s1 subunit assists recognize sugar receptors rbd in the s1 subunit is critical for the binding of coronavirus to the ace-2 receptor 18 19 20 21  ctd in the s1 subunit could recognize other receptors 22  the binding of rbd to ace2 facilitates the cleavage of the spike protein and promotes the dissociation of the s1 subunit from the s2 subunit 23  s2 contains two heptad repeats hr1 and hr2 a fusion peptide and a protease cleavage site s2 the dissociation of s1 induces s2 to undergo a dramatic structural change to fuse the host and viral membranes thus the spike protein serves as a target for development of antibodies entry inhibitors and vaccines 24  coronavirus transits from a metastable prefusion state to a highly stable post-fusion state as part of the spike proteins role in membrane fusion the instability of the prefusion state presents a significant challenge for the production of protein antigens for antigenic presentation of the prefusion antibody epitopes that are most likely to lead to neutralizing responses thus since the prefusion spike protein exists in a thermodynamically metastable state 1  a stabilized mutant conformation is critical for the development of vaccines and drugs computational mutagenesis is an effective approach to finding mutations that are able to stabilize proteins we have previously developed a protein design platform eris 25 26  which utilizes a physical force field 27 for modeling inter-atomic interactions as well as fast side-chain packing and backbone relaxation algorithms to enable efficient and transferrable protein molecular design originally eris has been validated on 595 mutants from five proteins corroborating the unbiased force field side-chain packing and backbone relaxation algorithms in many later studies eris has been validated through prediction of thermodynamically stabilizing or destabilizing mutations 28 29 30 31 32 33  and direct protein design efforts 34 35 36 37  in this work we propose a pipeline to automatically stabilize spike proteins through computational mutagenesis within the pipeline we first analyze the conservation score and solvent accessible surface area sasa of residues in the protein we then perform discrete molecular dynamics dmd 38 39 40 41 simulations to calculate the root mean square fluctuation rmsf of residues to analyze their flexibility based on this information we select appropriate residues 2  conservation score  5 sasa  04 rmsf  35  see discussion as mutation sites we subject the selected residues to computational redesign using eris to find the stabilizing mutations by calculating the change in free energy       where  and  are the free energies of the mutant protein and wild type proteins correspondingly we utilize this pipeline to identify stabilization mutants of the spike protein next we describe our methods in detail and provide a list of stabilizing mutations for spike protein  we propose a pipeline to automatically find stabilized mutants of proteins  figure   1  the pipeline can be divided into two stages in the first stage users designate the protein of interest and then the pipeline will analyze the 3d structure of the protein by using different metrics in the second stage users designate the mutation sites according to the analysis of the 3d structure of the protein and finally the pipeline will determine the stabilizing mutations of the protein users can either upload the 3d structure of the protein or input the pdb id of the protein to designate the protein of interest in the first stage the first step is to remodel the 3d structure of the protein of interest to complete the missing atoms and residues we integrate modeller into our pipeline to remodel proteins next the pipeline utilizes consurf 48 to calculate the conservation score of each residue in the protein of interest the conservation score indicates the importance of the residue in maintaining protein structure andor function subsequently the pipeline utilizes dmd to analyze the flexibility of each residue in the spike protein through rmsf the technique has already been used to efficiently study the protein folding thermodynamics and protein oligomerization and allows for a good equilibration of the structures then the pipeline will calculate sasa of residues in the protein in the second stage users designate the mutation sites according to the conservation score rmsf and sasa a high conservation score  7 indicates the residue may play important roles in the function or the stability of the structure of the protein residues of high rmsf  35  are likely the culprit to undermine the stability of the structure of the protein hence we select residues that have a low conservation score or high rmsf residues with sasa  05 are considered buried and residues with sasa  05 are considered exposed to solvent after the designation of the mutation sites the pipeline utilizes eris to determine the changes in free energies of the mutants for each residue in the mutation sites  we utilize modeller 42 to re-model the 3d structure of the spike protein by using a structure deposited to protein databank pdb pdbid6vsb 12  the cryo-em structure of the prefusion state of the spike protein as the template structure to complete the missing atoms and residues  figure 2ab  next we use chiron 44 all following computational mutagenesis study are performed using the structure with the 3 rbds in down conformation to validate the ability of the pipeline to identify stabilization mutants we use the pipeline to calculate the free energy changes of several known prefusion spike protein stabilization mutants the 2p mutation strategy k986p and v987p has been proved effective for the stabilization of spike protein of sars-cov-2 and other betacoronavirus 122050  hsieh and coworkers 51  the spike protein is mainly composed of s1 and s2 subunits  figure s1  we select residues for mutation from the ntd and rbd domains in s1 and we also select residues from the hr1 heptad repeat 1 and ch central helix domains in s2 we dont select residues from hr2 domain in s2 because the structure of the hr2 domain has not been solved in the cryo-em structure 6vsb at the outset we calculate the conservation score  figure 3ad  of all residues by using consurf based on the conservation score most residues in hr1ch are conservative while residues in ntd and rbd are prone to mutation in evolution next we use pymol 47 to calculate sasa of all residues in the spike protein  figure 3be  sasa indicates the level of residues exposed to the solvent in a protein and usually most of the functional residues are located on the protein structures surface 52  all four domains have both low sasa residues and high sasa residues then we perform 1000000 steps dmd simulation for the spike protein to calculate the rmsf of each residue  figure 3cf  the residues in hr1ch have extremely low rmsf while the residues in ntd and rbd domains have moderate to high rmsf we select residues that have different conservation scores in these four domains for mutagenesis in the ntd we select 5 residues table s1  with the conservation score ranging from 1 highly variable to 9 highly conservative the sasa of these residues range from 001 buried to 075 exposed the rmsf range from 161  frozen to 488  flexible likewise in the other three domains table s2- 3 we select 5 to 7 residues respectively these residues also have diverse conservation scores sasa and rmsf of note to avoid affecting the function of the spike protein these residues are all not chosen from the functional sites of the spike protein such as the ace2 binding site in rbd we utilize eris to calculate the free energy changes of mutants relative to the wild type  figure 4a  figure s23  and table s4-6 in the ntd 5 residues e169 k113 i203 r246 and l270 are selected for mutagenesis among them the free energy changes of nearly all mutations of residues i203 r246 and l270 are positive indicating that they are destabilizing the structure in contrast most mutations on residues e169 and k113 have negative free energy changes suggesting that they are stabilizing the structure the mutant that has the most negative free energy change is r246c however cysteine is prone to forming disulfide bond with other cysteine which may affect the correct folding of the protein structure so we recommend k113m to be a better choice as the stabilization mutant in the rbd 5 residues a411 t415 y505 n439 and d428 table s2 are selected for mutagenesis the free energy changes calculated by eris  figure s2  in the hr1ch domain 7 residues l948 i1018 a1026 y1007 s1003 t961 and v976 are selected for mutagenesis as shown in table s3  in stark contrast to ntd and rbd most residues have extremely high free energy changes  30 kcalmol suggesting that these residues are not very good choices for mutagenesis the high free energy changes also implicate that they may play important roles in stabilizing the structure so that they are irreplaceable to some extent this finding is also in concert with the high conservation scores of these residues that said we can still find stabilization mutants for these residues such as t961a and s1003m  figure s3  compared to experimental mutagenesis such as random mutagenesis 53 54 and site-directed mutagenesis 55 56  computational mutagenesis 25 is an efficient alternative that lays the foundation of large-scale mutation screening however performing computational mutation screening for all residues in the spike protein trimeric structure which consists of 1288 residues in each monomer is still timeconsuming and inefficient so we seek to select critical residues to perform mutagenesis in this work to interrogate how to select residues as mutation sites we select residues that have different conservation scores sasa and rmsf we find that the probability of stabilizing mutations for specific residues is correlated with the conservation score sasa and rmsf of these residues  figure 4b -d we calculate the average and the minimum free energy change of all 19 mutations of each residue we find that the average free energy change of mutations of residues with either high 5 or low 2 conservation score are typically larger than 0 only mutations in residues that have moderate 25 conservation score have negative average free energy change thus indicating a possibility to find stabilizing mutations we posit that conservative residues are typically playing critical roles in structural stability or protein functioning 57  making them a likely target for finding stabilizing mutations however if the conservation score of the residue is too high the residue may be irreplaceable and any mutation will destabilize the structure on the other hand residues with low conservation scores may be less critical to the structural stability reducing the chances for finding stabilizing mutations at these positions thus we select residues that have moderate conservation score 25 for mutagenesis similarly we find that residues with large sasa or large rmsf have more stabilization mutants than residues with low sasa or low rmsf respectively overall we select residues that have moderate conservation score 25 high sasa 04 and high rmsf 35  for mutagenesis in addition although we only select residues in ntd rbd and hr1ch domains to perform mutagenesis residues in other regions can also be used as mutation sites for example the known 2p mutation strategy k986p and v987p has been proved effective for the stabilization of spike protein of sars-cov-2 and other betacoronavirus 12 20 50  in this work we propose a pipeline to automatically stabilize proteins through computational mutagenesis we analyze the conservation score rmsf and sasa of residues in the spike protein through the pipeline we propose criteria based on the conservation score rmsf and sasa to identify residues for mutation finally we utilize eris to calculate the free energy change and find stabilizing mutants all source codes are deposited in

tremendous effort has been given to the development of diagnostic tests preventive vaccines and therapeutic medicines for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 much of this development has been based on the reference genome collected on january 5 2020 based on the genotyping of 6156 genome samples collected up to april 24 2020 we report that sars-cov-2 has had 4459 alarmingly mutations which can be clustered into five subtypes we introduce mutation ratio and mutation h-index to characterize the protein conservativeness and unveil that sars-cov-2 envelope protein main protease and endoribonuclease protein are relatively conservative while sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein spike protein and papain-like protease are relatively non-conservative in particular the nucleocapsid protein has more than half its genes changed in the past few months signaling devastating impacts on the ongoing development of covid-19 diagnosis vaccines and drugs  the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 poses crucial threats to the public health and the world economy since it was detected in wuhan china in december 2019 1  as of april 24 2020 more than 26 million cases of covid-19 have been reported in 185 countries and territories resulting in more than 184000 deaths 2  tragically there is no sign of slowing down nor relief at this monument partially due to the fact there is no specific anti-sars-cov-2 drugs and effective vaccines sars-cov-2 is a positive-strand rna virus and belongs to the beta coronavirus genus the genomic information underpins the development of antiviral medical interventions preventative vaccines and viral diagnostic tests the first sars-cov-2 genome was reported on january 5 2020 3  it has a genome size of 2999 kb which encodes for multiple non-structural and structural proteins the leader sequence and orf1ab encode non-structural proteins for rna replication and transcription among various nonstructural proteins viral papain-like pl proteinase main protease or 3cl protease rna polymerase and endoribo-nuclease are common targets in antiviral drug discovery however it typically takes more than ten years to put an average drug to the market the downstream regions of the genome encode structural proteins including spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein notably s-protein uses one of two subunits to bind directly to the host receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 enabling the virus entry into host cells 4  the nucleocapsid n protein one of the most abundant viral proteins can bind to the rna genome and is involved in replication processes assembly the host cellular response during viral infection 5  the e protein is a small integral membrane protein a virulence factor regulating cell stress response and apoptosis and promoting inflammation 6  the structural proteins especially the spike protein and the n protein are the candidate antigens for vaccine development developing safe and effective vaccines is urgently needed to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 however it typically takes over one year to design and test a new vaccine furthermore the sars-cov-2 genome undergoes rapid mutations partially stimulated as a response to the challenging immunological environments arising from the covod-19 patients of different races ages and medical conditions sars-cov-2 exists as heterogeneous and dynamic populations because of their error-prone replication 7  the vaccine developed at one time may not be effective for mitigating the infection by new mutated virus isolates an alarming fact is that many of these mutations may devastate the on-going effort in the development of effective medicines preventive vaccines and diagnostic tests accurate identification of the antigens and their mutations represents the most important roadblock in developing effective vaccines against covid-19 for example different vaccines are needed for different geographic locations due to predominant mutations in the corresponding regions in covid-19 diagnosis the diagnosis kits are designed using two major methods ie specific serological tests and molecular tests serological tests are to detect specific covid-19 proteins molecular diagnoses test specific covid-19 pathogenic genes which usually rely on the polymerase chain reaction pcrbecause of the fast mutations of the sars-cov-2 genome genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 may optimize the pcr primer design to detect sars-cov safely and reduce the risk of false-negatives caused by genome sequence variations in addition the genotyping analysis may also reveal those regions that are highly conserved with very few mutations which can be selected as a target sequence for reliable drug therapy and general diagnosis the evolution pattern through the highly frequent mutations of sars-cov-2 can be observable on short time scales in the early infection period ie february 2020 the sars-cov-2 variants were clustered as s and l types 8  recent genotyping analysis reveals a large number of mutations in various essential genes encoding the s protein the n protein and rna polymerase in the sars-cov-2 population 9  monitoring the evolutionary patterns and spread dynamics of sars-cov-2 is of grace importance for covid-19 control and prevention although mutations occur randomly most preserved mutations can be regarded as virus responds to the host immune system surveillance as a result the faster and the wider the sars-cov-2 spread is the more frequent and diverse the mutations will be the tracking and analysis of covid-19 dynamics transmission and spread is of paramount importance for winning the on-going battle against covid-19 genetic identification and characterization of the geographic distribution intercontinental evolution and global trends of sars-cov-2 is the most efficient approach for studying covid-19 genomic epidemiology and offer the molecular foundation for region-specific sars-cov-2 vaccine design drug discovery and diagnostic development 10  for example different vaccines for the shell can be designed according to predominant mutations this work provides the most comprehensive genotyping to reveal the transmission trajectory and spread dynamics of covid-19 to date based on genotyping 6156 sars-cov-2 genomes from the world as of april 24 2020 we trace the covid-19 transmission pathways and analyze the distribution of the subtypes of sars-cov-2 across the world we use k-means methods to cluster sars-cov-2 mutations which provides the updated molecular information for the region-specific design of vaccines drugs and diagnoses our clustering results show that globally there are at least five distinct subtypes of sars-cov-2 genomes while in the us there are at least three significant sars-cov-2 genotypes we introduce mutation hindex and mutation ratio to characterize conservative and non-conservative proteins and genes we unveil the unexpected non-conservative genes and proteins rendering an alarming warning for the current development of diagnostic tests preventive vaccines and therapeutic medicines tracking the sars-cov-2 transmission pathways and analyzing the spread dynamics are critical to the study of genomic epidemiology temporospatially clustering the genotypes of sars-cov-2 in transmission provides insights into diagnostic testing and vaccine development in disease control in this work we retrieve and genotype 6156 sars-cov-2 isolates from word as of april 24 2020 there are 4459 single mutations in 6156 sars-cov-2 isolates based on these mutations we classify and track the geographical distributions of 6156 genoytype isolates by k-means clustering the sars-cov-2 genotypes represented as snp variants are clustered as five groups in the world table 2  the genotypes in the us are clustered as three groups table 2  the optimal clustering groups are established using the elbow method in the k-means clustering algorithm see supporting material the detailed distribution of the snp variants from the world for each cluster is provided in the supporting material the snp variant clusters from 11 countries that have the highest number of cases recorded in are listed in table 2 figure 1  the geographic distribution of the snp variant clusters reflects the approximate transmission pathways and spread dynamics across the world several findings can be read from the table 2 1 two early subtypes of sasr-cov-2 cluster i and ii are epidemic in the asian countries cn jp kr 2 the subtypes of sars-cov-2 in cluster iii is not spreading in the european countries uk de fr it 3 all of the subtypes of sars-cov-2 in five different clusters can be found in the us au and canada moreover we analyze the statistic of snp variants located in different states of the united states in table 3  we list the number of cases in three different clusters with respects to the west coast states we note that cluster c in the us is derived from cluster iii in the world with an additional mutation at the leader sequence 241 the high spread in new york is consistent with the high transmission of sars-cov-2 in the european countries where the subtype in cluster iii is predominated table 5 presents the statistics of single mutations on various sars-cov-2 proteins that occurred in the recorded genomes between january 5 2020 and april 24 2020 the papain-like protease has the highest number of mutations of 599 while the envelope protein has the lowest number of mutations of 13 since the sizes of proteins vary dramatically from 1945 for the papain-like protease to 75 for the envelope protein it is useful to consider the mutation ratio ie the number of mutations per residue in this category the envelope protein still has the lowest score of 017 whereas the nucleocapsid protein has the highest score of 056 ie 235 mutations on its 419 residues note that 3cl protease has the second-lowest mutation ratio of 022 indicating its conservative nature another relatively conservative protein judged by the mutations ratio is the rna-dependent rna polymerase it has 223 mutations over its 932 residues counting the number of single mutations and mutation ratio does not reflect the fact some mutations occur numerous times over genome samples while other mutations may happen only on a few genome samples to account for the frequency effect of mutations we introduce a mutation h-index to measure both the number of mutations and the frequency of mutations of a given protein or genetic section it is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given protein genetic section has h single mutations that have each occurred at least h times it is very interesting to note from table 5 that the mutation h-index correlates very well with the number of mutations per residue specifically nucleocapsid protein has both the highest number of mutations per residues of 056 and the highest h-index of 27 suggesting that it is the most non-conservative protein in sars-cov-2 genomes in contrast the envelope protein has the lowest number of mutations per residues of 017 and the lowest h-index of 5 indicating its relatively conservative nature by combining the number of mutations per residue and the mutation h-index we report that the three most conservative sars-cov-2 proteins are 1 the envelope protein 2 the main protease and 3 the endoribonuclease it is found that the most non-conservative sars-cov-2 proteins are 1 the nucleocapsid protein 2 the spike protein and 3 the papain-like protease real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr is routinely used in the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from sars-cov-2 for diagnostic testing covid-19 11 12  the primers used in the rrt-pcr are critical for the precise diagnosis of covid-19 and the discovery of new strains the primer sequences are specially designed for amplifying the conserved regions across the different existing strains for high specificity and sensitivity and also are subject to genotype changes as the sars-cov-2 coronavirus evolves in diagnostic testing covid-19 many rrt-pcr primers are designed to detect for three perceived conservative sars-cov-2 regions 1 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene in orf1ab region 2 the e protein gene and 3 the n protein gene 11  our genotyping statistics given in table 5 indicates that the nucleocapsid protein is the worst choice among four structural proteins of sars-cov-2 the spike surface glycoprotein s of 1273 amino acid residues nucleocapsid protein n of 419 amino acid residues membrane protein m of 222 amino acid residues envelope protein e of 75 amino acid residues the s protein is the most divergent with 385 unique mutations among the 6156 sars-cov-2 genomes the n protein has 235 unique mutations the e protein has 13 mutations considering the lengths of the proteins all the four structural proteins undergo high mutations the rdrp gene which is often used in diagnostic testing covid-19 also has 223 mutations therefore all the three regions in routine rrt-pcr target namely rdrp the n protein gene and the e protein genes have significant mutations precise and robust diagnosis tools must be re-established according to the conserved regions and predominated mutations in the sars-cov-2 genomes detailed in the supporting material notably sars-cov-2 has a unique furin cleavage site where four amino acid residues prra are inserted into the s1-s2 junction region 681-684 of the s protein 13  the furin cleavage site is crucial for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 14  this study reveals crucial mutations near the s1-s2 junction region in the s protein including 23403ag- moreover these mutations of the s protein sars-cov-2 are located at the epitope region corresponding to the regions 469-882 and 599-620 in sars-cov 15  additionally many mutated amino acids are on the surface of the s protein as shown in fig 5  unfortunately the s protein is the second most non-conservative protein in the genome based on the number of mutations per residue and mutation h-index in fact about half of the receptor-binding domain residues of the s proteins have had mutations in the past few months as shown in fig 6  because the surface accessibility of epitope is also important for the interaction of antibody and antigen these mutations are critical for the antigenicity of the s protein the convalescent covid-19 patients show a neutralizing antibody response after infection which are directed against the s protein or the n protein 16  the neutralizing antibody responses against sars-cov-2 could give some defense against sars-cov-2 infection and thus having implications for preventing sars-cov-2 outbreaks the divergence of spike proteins the non-conserved regions of the spike proteins might contribute to the antigenicity the high frequent mutations identified in the s protein and the n proteins must be considered when designing a vaccine unfortunately there is no specific effective drug for sars-cov-2 at this point much of the drug discovery effort focuses on sars-cov-2 non-structural proteins among the major non-structural proteins of sars-cov-2 the main protease of 306 amino acids has 68 mutations with 022 mutations per residue and the mutation h-index of 9 rna polymerase of 932 amino acids has 223 mutations with 024 mutations per residue and the mutation h-index of 13 and papain-like protease of 1945 amino acids has 599 mutations with 031 mutations per residue and the mutation h-index of 15 in fact the main protease is the most popular drug target because there are no similar known genes in the human genome which implies sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors will be likely less toxic 17  the present study suggests that the main protease is the second most conservative protein therefore it remains the most attractive target for drug discovery  the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein or s protein comprised of two subunits s1 and s2 of very different properties 13  see fig 5  among them the s1 subunit as shown in fig  5  contains the receptor-binding domain rbd responsible for binding to the host cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 the rbd is also the common binding domain for antibodies the s2 subunit offers the structural support of the s protein and mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes after the fusion the virus releases the viral genome into the host cell the s1 rbd protein plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and t-cell responses as well as protective immunity however s2 and extracellular domain ecd of spike protein and their combination are commonly used in recombinant proteins in sars-cov-2 antibody development table 5  the s protein is the most heterogeneous structural protein with a significant number of mutations as shown in figs 5 and 6 and table 6  the divergence of the spike protein the non-conserved regions of the spike protein might contribute to the antigenicity difference in sars-cov-2 isolates we found that most of the high frequent mutations of the s protein are located in the s1 subunit figure  6 indicates that near half of the amino acid residues have had mutations since january 5 2020 one of the important mutations at s1 is 23010 v483a within the rbd for ace2 binding the structural study revealed that the amino acids 442-487 in the s1 subunit may impact viral binding to human ace2 18 19  the mutations identified in this study imply the change in ace2 binding affinity and the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 as well as negative impacts in preventive vaccine and diagnostic test development top1  10323  k90r  52  1  8  43  0  0  top2  10097  g15s  51  0  1  0  50  0

essential for cleaving the polyproteins that are translated from the viral rna 17  it operates at multiple cleavage sites on the large polyprotein through the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication sars-cov-2 main protease is one of the most attractive targets for anti-cov drug design because its inhibition would block viral replication and it is unlikely to be toxic due to no known similar human proteases another reason for the focused drug discovery efforts in developing sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors is that this protein is relatively conservative as shown in table 5  figure 7 illustrates the main protease mutation patterns figure 8 further highlights the inhibitor binding domain bd indeed the main protease is relatively conservative compared to the spike protein table 7 lists top 11 mutations and their frequency in our dataset it is interesting to see that many mutations such as y239y n151n r298r l272l and p132p are degenerate ones one possible explanation is that nondegenerate may be non-silent and likely cause unsurvivable disruption to the virus note that mutation g15s mostly occurs in cluster iv mutation y239y is restricted to cluster i some other mutations such as r298r g71s and p132p are specific to certain clusters nonetheless some mutations at the bd shown in fig 8 are worth noting they can undermine the ongoing drug discovery effort top1  3037  f106f  3889  0  80  1800  964  1045  top2  2891  a58t  120  0  119  0  1  0  top3  3177  p153l  72  0  69  2  1  0

sars-cov-2 papain-like protease plpro is a cysteine cleavage protein located within the non-structural protein 3 ns3 section of the viral genome 20  like the main protease plpro activity is required to cleave the viral polyprotein into functional mature subunits and thereby contributes to the biogenesis of the virus replication additionally plpro possesses a deubiquitinating activity the sars plpro is also a major therapeutic and diagnostic target as shown in table 5  the sars plpro is prone to mutations figure 9 shows that mutations are all over the places in plpro table 8 lists top ten mutations in plpro five of these mutations are degenerate ones including one of the highest frequented mutations note that none one of the top mutations occurred in cluster i on the contrast cluster ii has many different mutations 21  as one of the non-structure proteins rdrps located in the early part of orf1b section like most other rna viruses sars-cov-2 rdrps are considered to be highly conserved to maintain viral functions and thus targeted in antiviral drug development as well as diagnostic tests on the other hand the sars-cov-2 rna polymerase lacks proofreading capability and thus its mutations are deemed to happen as shown in table 5  figure 10 illustrates the sars-cov-2 rdrp mutations since january 5 2020 surprisingly there are many mutations in sars-cov-2 rdrp table 9 describes the top ten mutations as in other cases five of these mutations are degenerate ones cluster i has no nondegenerate mutations  endoribo-nuclease nendou protein is a nidoviral rnauridylate-specific enzyme that cleaves rna 22  it contains a c-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the endou family rna processing the nendou protein is presented among coronaviruses arteriviruses and toroviruses the many aspects of the detailed function and activity of sars-cov-2 nendou protein are yet to be revealed figure 11 depicts sars-cov-2 nendou protein mutations like in most other sars-cov-2 proteins mutations have occurred over different parts table 5 shows that nendou is relatively conservative table  10 lists the top twelve high-frequency mutations of the

bind with rna additionally sars-cov-2 n protein confirms the viral genome to replicasetranscriptase complex rtc and plays a crucial role in viral genome encapsulation therefore it may function completely differently at different stages of the viral life cycle sars-cov-2 n protein is considered to be one of the most conservative sars-cov-2 proteins in the literature and is a popular target for diagnosis of vaccine development 11  the present works shown in table 5 indicates the sars-cov-2 n protein is the worst target of any drug vaccine and diagnostic development table 12 presents the top fourteen mutations of the sars-cov-2 n protein since january 5 2020 note that only three out of fourteen top mutations are degenerate ones which is a significantly lower ratio than that of other proteins the frequency of 14th mutation is 67 which suggests there are many mutations associated with these mediate-sized proteins most top mutations occurred to clusters ii and iv cluster v has none of the top fourteen mutations  membrane protein sars-cov-2 membrane m protein is another structural protein and plays a central role in viral assembly and viral particle formation it exists as a dimer in the virion and has certain geometric shapes to enable certain membrane curvature and binding to nucleocapsid proteins similar to other sars-cov proteins m protein is also a popular target for viral diagnosis and vaccines table 5 gives sars-cov-2 m protein the meddle ranking for its conservation table 13 details the top eleven mutations in sars-cov-2 m protein occurred in the past few months seven of these mutations are degenerate clusters i and v have relatively a few of these mutations on january 5 2020 the complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was first released on genbank access number nc 0455122 by zhangs group at fudan university 3  since then there has been a rapid accumulation of sars-cov-2 genome sequences in this work 6156 complete genome sequences with high coverage of sars-cov-2 strains from the infected individuals in the world are downloaded from the gi-said database 25 httpswwwgisaidorg as of april 24 2020 all the records in gisaid without the exact submission date will not take into considerations to rearrange the 6156 complete genome sequences according to the reference sars-cov-2 genome multiple sequence alignment msa is carried out by using clustal omega 26 with default parameters snp genotyping measures the genetic variations between different members of a species establishing the snp genotyping method for the investigation of the genotype changes during the transmission and evolution of sars-cov-2 is of great importance by analyzing the rearranged genome sequences snp profiles which record all of thesnp positions in teams of the nucleotide changes and its corresponding positions can be constructed the snp profiles of a given genome of a covid-19 patient capture all the differences from a complete reference genome sequence and can be considered as the genotype of the individual sars-cov-2 the jaccard distance measures dissimilarity between sample sets the jaccard distance of snp variants is widely employed in the phylogenetic analysis of human or bacterial genomes 9  in this work we utilize the jaccard distance to compare the difference between the snp variant profiles of sars-cov-2 genomes the jaccard similarity coefficient also known as the jaccard index is defined as the intersection size divided by the union of two sets a b 27  the jaccard distance of two sets a b is scored as the difference between one and the jaccard similarity coefficient and is a metric on the collection of all finite sets therefore the genetic distance of two genomes corresponds to the jaccard distance of their snp variants in principle the jaccard distance measure of snp variants takes account of the ordering ofsnp positions ie transmission trajectory when an appropriate reference sample is selected however one may fail to identify the infection pathways from the mutual jaccard distances of multiple samples in this case the dates of the sample collections offer useful information additionally clustering techniques such as kmeans described below enable us to characterize the spread of covid-19 onto the communities k-means clustering is one of the fundamental unsupervised algorithms in machine learning which aims at partitioning a given data set x  x 1  x 2      x n      x n  x n  r d into k clusters c 1  c 2      c k  k  n such that the specific clustering criteria are optimized more specifically the standard k-means clustering algorithm starts to pick k points as cluster centers randomly and then allocates each data to its nearest cluster the cluster centers will be updated iteratively by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares wcss which is defined by where  k  i  c k x i n k is the mean of points located in the k-th cluster c k and n k is the number of points in c k  here  2 denote the l 2 distance the algorithm above only provides a way to obtain the optimal partition for a fixed number of clusters however we are interested in finding the best number of clusters for the snp variants therefore the elbow method is applied by varying the number of clusters k a set of wcss can be calculated in the k-means clustering process and then the plot of wcss according to the number of clusters k can be carried out the location of the elbow in this plot will be considered as the optimal number of clusters to be noticed the wcss measures the variability of the points within each cluster which is influenced by the number of points n  therefore as the number of total points of n increases the value of wcss becomes larger additionally the performance of k-means clustering depends on the selection of the specific distance in this work we propose to implement k-means clustering with the elbow method for analyzing the optimal number of the subtypes of sars-cov-2 snp variants the jaccard distance-based and locationbased representations are considered as the input features for the k-means clustering method suppose we have a total of n snp variants concerning a reference genome in a sars-cov-2 sample the location of the mutation sites for each snp variant will be saved in the set s i  i  1 2     n  the jaccard distance between two different sets or samples s i  s j is denoted as d j s i  s j  therefore the n n jaccard distance-based representation will be suppose we have n snp variants with respect to a reference genome in a sars-cov-2 sample among them m different mutation sites can be counted for i-th snp variant v i  v 1 i  v 2 i      v m i  i  1 2     n is a 1  m vector which satisfies  therefore an n  m location-based representation will be hundreds of complete genome sequences are deposit to the gisaid every day which results in an evergrowing massive quantity of high dimensional data representations for the k-means clustering for example if the dataset of an organism involves 10000 snps the initial representation will be a 10000dimensional vector for each sample which can be computationally difficult for a simple k-means clustering algorithm therefore a dimensionality reduction method is used to pre-process the data the essential idea of pca-based k-means clustering is to invoke the pca to obtain a reduced-dimensional representation of each sample before performing the k-means clustering in practice one can select a few lowest dimensional principal components as the k-means input for each sample in ref 28  the authors proved that the principal components are the continuous solution of the cluster indicators in the k-means clustering method which provides us a rigorous mathematical tool to embed our high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional pca subspace the rapid global transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has offered some of the most heterogeneous diverse and challenging mutagenic environments to stimulate dramatic genetic evolution and response from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this work provides the most comprehensive genotyping of sars-cov-2 transmission and evolution up to date based on 6156 genome samples and reveals five clusters of the covid-19 genomes and associated mutations on eight different sars-cov-2 proteins we introduce mutation h-index and mutation ratio to qualify individual proteins degree of non-conservativeness we unveil that sars-cov-2 envelope protein main protease and endoribonuclease protein are relatively the most conservative whereas sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein spike protein and papain-like protease are relatively the most non-conservative we report an alarming fact that all of the sars-cov-2 proteins have undergone intensive mutations since january 5 2020 and some of these mutations may seriously undermine ongoing efforts on covid-19 diagnostic testing vaccine development and

simmonds manuscript 2  p a g e abstract abstract the pandemic of sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has motivated an intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread to understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence a dataset of 985 complete sars-cov-2 sequences was assembled variants 20 showed a mean 55-95 nucleotide differences from each other commensurate with a mid-range coronavirus substitution rate of 3x10 -4 substitutionssiteyear almost half of sequence changes were c-u transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between c-u and u-c substitutions elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 -oc43 -229e 25 and -hku1 proportionate to their increasing divergence c-u transitions underpinned almost half of the amino acid differences between sars-cov-2 variants and occurred preferentially in both 5ua and 3ua flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human apobec3 proteins marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses uagc and low gc contents may represent long term effects of prolonged c-u hypermutation in their hosts 30 importance the evidence that much of sequence change in sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host apobec-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short and long term evolution repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favoured mutational hotspots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus 35 represents a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and darwinian evolutionary frameworks that are typically used in molecular epidemiology investigations  sars-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 emerged late 2019 in the hubei province china as a cause of respiratory disease occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death covid- 19 1-4 since the first reports in december 2019 infections with sars-cov-2 have been reported 45 from a rapidly increasing number of countries worldwide and led to its declaration as a pandemic by the world health organisation in march 2020 in order to understand the origins and transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 sequencing of sars-cov-2 directly from samples of infected individuals worldwide has been performed on an unprecedented scale these efforts have generated many thousands of high quality consensus sequences spanning the length of the genome and have defined 50 a series of geographically defined clusters that recapitulate the early routes of international spread however as commented elsewhere httpsdoiorg101101202003 1620034470  there is remarkable little virus diversity at this early stage of the pandemic and analyses of its evolutionary dynamics remain at an early stage the relative infrequency of substitutions is the consequence of a much lower error rate on genome copying by the viral rna polymerase of the larger nidovirales including coronaviruses this is achieved through the development of a proofreading capability through mismatch detection and excision by a viral encoded exonuclease nsp14-exon 5-7 consequently coronaviruses show a low substitution rate over time typically in the range of 15 -10 x 10 -4 substitutions per site per year ssy 8- 13  60 applying a mid-range estimate to the 3-5 month timescale of the sars-cov-2 pandemic indicates that epidemiologically unrelated strains might show around 6-10 nucleotides differences from each other over the 30000 base length of their genomes in the current study we have analysed the nature of the sequence diversity generated within the 65 sars-cov-2 virus populations revealed by current and ongoing virus sequencing studies we obtained evidence for a preponderance of driven mutational events within the short evolutionary period following the zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 into humans sequence substitutions were characterised by a preponderance of cytidine to uridine c-u transitions the possibility that the initial diversity within a viral population was largely host-induced would have major implications for 70 evolutionary reconstruction of sars-cov-2 variants in the current pandemic as well as in our understanding both of host antiviral pathways against coronaviruses and the longer term shaping effects on their genome composition sequence changes in sars-cov-2 four separate datasets of full length near- complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 sequences collected from the start of the pandemic to those most recently deposited on the 24 th april 2020 were aligned and analysed each dataset showed minimal levels of 80 sequence divergence with mean pairwise distances ranging from 55-95 nucleotide differences between each sequence however several aspects of the frequencies and sequence contexts of the observed changes were unexpected firstly the ratio of non-synonymous amino acid changing to synonymous substitutions was high -in the range of 057-073 amongst the different sars-cov-2 datasets this contrasts with a much lower ratio consistently below 022 in sequence datasets 85 assembled for the other human coronaviruses table 1  including a range of coronaviruses in the analysis there was a consistent association between dnds with degree of sequence divergence  fig   1  we next estimated frequencies of individual transitions and transversions occurring during the short-90 terms evolution of sars-cov-2 sequence differences between each sars-cov-2 full genome sequence and a majority rule consensus sequence generated for each of the four sars-cov-2 datasets were calculated the directionality of sequence change underlying the observed substitutions was inferred through restricting analysis to polymorphic sites with a minimal number of variable bases typically singletons in practice because of the scarcity of substitutions variability thresholds of 10 95 5 2 and 1 yielded similar numbers and relative frequencies of each transition and transversion equivalent evidence for directionality was obtained through comparison of each sequence in the dataset with the first outbreak sequence mn908947 wuhan-hu-1 approximately ancestral to current circulating sars-cov-2 strains data not shown for the purposes of the analysis presented here a consensus-based 5 threshold was used 100 a listing of the sequence changes revealed a striking approximately four-fold excess of sites where c-u substitutions occurred in sars-cov-2 sequences compared to the other three transitions  fig   2a  this excess was the more remarkable given there was an almost two-fold greater number of u bases in the sars-cov-2 genome compared to cs 321 compared to 184 to formally analyse 105 the excess of c-u transitions we calculated an index of asymmetry frequencyc-u  fu-c x fufc and compared this with degrees of sequence divergence and dnds ratio in sars-cov-2 and other coronavirus datasets fig 2b 2c  this comparison showed that the excess of c-u substitutions was most marked among very recently diverged sequences associated with the sars-cov-2 and sars-cov outbreaks and was reduced significantly in sequence datasets of the more divergent human 110 coronaviruses nl63 oc43 229e and oc43 datasets as sequences accumulated substitutions c-u substitutions were scattered throughout the sars-cov-2 genome fig 3  long bars representing more polymorphic sites were frequently shared between replicate datasets but unique substitutions occurring once in the dataset -short bars showed largely separate distributions substitutions were 115 not focussed towards any particular gene or intergenic region although all three datasets showed marginally higher frequencies of substitutions in the n gene the grouping of a selection of sequences showing c-u changes in different genome regions were plotted in a phylogenetic tree containing sequences from the sars-cov-2 dataset fig 4  within the resolution possible in tree generated from such a minimally divergent dataset many sequences with shared c-u changes were not monophyletic 120 eg those with substitutions at positions 5784 10319 21575 28657 and 28887 this lack of grouping is consistent with multiple de novo occurrences of the same mutation in different sars-cov-2 lineages the abnormally high dnds ratios of 06-07 in sars-cov-2 sequences table 1  fig 1  indicated that 125 around 50 of nucleotide substitutions would produce amino acid changes if approximately 75 of nucleotide changes are non-synonymous on analysis of amino acid sequence changes a remarkable 50 of non-synonymous substitutions in the sars-cov-2 sequence dataset were the consequence of c-u transitions fig 5  the underlying mechanism that leads to c-u hypermutation therefore also drives much of the amino acid sequence diversity observed in sars-cov-2 130 the context of cytidines within a sequence strongly influenced the likelihood of it mutating to a u fig   6  the greatest numbers of mutations were observed if the upstream 5 base was an a or u there was also a similar approximately 4-fold increase in transitions if these bases were located on the downstream 3 side the effects of the 5 and 3 contexts were additive c residues surrounded by 135 an a or u at both 5 and 3 sides were 10-fold more likely to mutate than those flanked by c or g residues mean 319 transitions compared to 36 splitting the data down into the 16 combinations of 5 and 3 contexts a 5u far more potently restricted non-c-u substitutions than a 5a  fig s1 suppl data while 5g or 5c almost eliminated substitutions irrespective of the 3 context no context created any substantial asymmetry in g-a compared to a-g transitions the gc content of coronaviruses varied substantially between species with highest frequencies in the recently emerged zoonotic coronaviruses mers-cov 41 sars-cov 41 and sars-cov-2 38 and lowest in hku1 32 collectively there was a significant relationship between c depletion and u enrichment with gc content fig 7  the difference in gc content was indeed almost entirely 145 attributable to changes in the frequencies of c and u bases the 9 difference in gc content between mers-cov and hku1 arose primarily from the 20 - 13 reduction in frequencies of c there was a comparable 8 increase in the frequency of u their combined effects left frequencies of g and a relatively unchanged it appears that the accumulated effect of the c-u  u-c asymmetry led to marked compositional abnormalities in coronaviruses 150 the wealth of sequence data generated since the outset of the sars-cov-2 pandemic the accuracy of the sequences obtained by a range of ngs technologies and the long genomes and very low substitution rate of coronaviruses provided a unique opportunity to investigate sequence diversification at very high resolution the findings additionally provide insights into the mutational mechanisms and contexts where sequence changes occur thirdly it informs us about the longer term 160 evolution of viruses and potential effects of the cell in moulding virus composition the mechanism of sars-cov-2 hypermutation the most striking finding that emerged from the analysis of more than 1000 sars-cov-2 genomes was the preponderance of c-u transitions compared to other substitutions in the initial 4-5 months of its evolution these accounted for 38-165 42 of all changes in the four sars-cov-2 datasets in seeking alternative non-biological explanations for this observation they cannot have arisen through misincorporation errors in the next generation sequence methods used to produce the dataset because the analysis in the current was restricted to consensus sequences these are generally assembled from libraries that typically possess reasonable coverage and read depth error frequencies of  10 -4 per site 14 would therefore improbably create 170 a consensus change in a sequence library there was furthermore no comparable increase in g-a mutations fig 2  and the sequence context in which sequencing errors occur a 5 or 3 c or g 14 did not match the favoured context for mutation observed in our dataset fig 6  coronavirus rna dependent rna polymerase during virus replication by definition a coronavirus rna genome descends from any other through an equal number of copyings of the positive and negative strands -any tendency to misincorporate a u instead of a c would be reflected in a parallel number of g-a mutations where this error occurred on the minus strand or vice versa as demonstrated however g-a mutations occurred at a much lower frequency than c-u mutations and were similar 180 to those of a-g figs 2a 6   while deamination of cytidines in single-stranded dna sequences is a hallmark of apobec function apobecs show binding affinities for single stranded rna templates that may mediate antiviral functions a3b and a3f has been shown to block retrotransposition of a line-1 transposons mrna through a non-deamination pathway 23  potentially through binding to single-stranded rna direct editing of hiv-1 rna by the rat a1 apobec and the accumulation of c-u hypermutation verified that 210 rna could also be used as a substrate for deamination 24  this suggested to the authors at that time that apobec-mediated rna editing was a potential antiviral activity mechanism against rna viruses as well as retroviruses since then evidence supporting this conjecture has been difficult to obtain the virus inhibitory effect 215 of apobecs against enterovirus a71 measles mumps and respiratory syncytial viruses were not shown to be associated with the development of virus mutations 25 26 similarly a3c a3f or a3h but not a3a a3d and a3g were shown to inhibit the replication of the human coronavirus hcov-nl63 but their expression did not lead to de novo c-u or g-a mutations on virus passaging 27  on the other hand it has been demonstrated that a3a and a3g possess potent rna editing capability 220 on mrna expressed in hypoxic macrophages 28  natural killer cells 29 and transfected a3goverexpressing hek 293t cells 30  these latter findings verify that apobecs do possess rna editing capabilities but do not provide any mechanistic context for the potential inhibition of rna virus replication by this mechanism nevertheless the pronounced asymmetry in c-u transitions in sars-cov-2 and the preferential substitution of cs flanked by u and a bases on both 5 and 3 sides  fig 6  225 that broadly matches what is known about the favoured contexts of a3a a3f and a3h 31 provides strong circumstantial grounds for suspecting a role of one or more apobec proteins in coronavirus mutagenesis their exceptionally long genomes 30000 bases the exposure of genomic rna in the cytoplasm before initiation of replication complex formation and the potentially lethal effects of just one mutations introduced into the genomic sequence makes apobec-mediated anti-coronaviral 230 activity plausible in virological terms it is perhaps because of the otherwise low mutation rate of coronaviruses and the extensive dataset of accurate minimally divergent sars-cov-2 sequences assembled post-pandemic that has enabled this mutational signature to be so clearly observed the key finding in the study was the combined evidence for an apobec-235 like editing process driving initial sequences changes in sars-cov-2 and that the observed substitutions have not arisen through a typical pattern on random mutation and fixation that is assumed in evolutionary models a specific problem for evolutionary reconstructions would be the existence of highly uneven substitution rates at different sites apobec-mediated editing and indeed the pattern of c-u transition in sars-cov-2 sequences is strongly dependent on sequence context 240 and for at least two apobecs additionally influenced by their proximity to rna secondary structure elements in the target sequence 28 31  sequence changes in sars-cov-2 and other coronavirus genomes may therefore be partially or largely restricted to number of mutational hotspots that may promote convergent changes between otherwise genetically unlinked strains as demonstrated in fig   4  these can conflict with relationships reconstructed from phylogenetically informative sites  the other important consequence of c-u hypermutation is that most of the amino acid sequence diversity observed in sars-cov-2 strains originates directly from forced mutations and therefore cannot be regarded in any way as adaptive for the virus fig 5  an rna editing mechanism of the type discussed above evidently places a huge mutational load on sars-cov-2 that may underpin the abnormally high dnds ratios recorded in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov sequence datasets fig 1  it is 260 likely that many or most amino acid changes are mildly deleterious and transient repeated rounds of mutation at favoured editing sites followed by reversion may therefore contribute to the large numbers of scattered substitutions in sars-cov-2 sequences that conflict with their phylogeny finally it is intriguing to speculate on the long-term effects of the c-uu-c asymmetry and the 265 extent to which this may contribute to the previously described compositional abnormalities of coronaviruses 32 33 as described above in connection with mutation frequencies the compositional asymmetries cannot directly arise through viral rdrp mutational biases because any resulting base frequency differences would be symmetric ie gc au instead it appears that the observed imbalances in frequencies of complementary bases reflect the progressive depletion of c 270 residues and accumulation of us by the apobec-like mutational process on the genomic  strand of coronaviruses culminating in the compositionally highly abnormal hku1 sequences 32 this appears to have driven down the gc content of coronaviruses as low as 32 while remarkably leaving g and a frequencies more or less unaltered fig 7  intriguingly the bat-derived coronaviruses along with the recently zoonotically transferred viruses into humans show the least degree of compositional 275 asymmetry the expansions in apobec gene numbers extensive positive selection and the consequent variability in apobec nucleic acid targeting 20 may indeed create distinct selection pressures on coronaviruses in different hosts the immediate appearance of c-u hypermutation in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 280 genomes in humans may therefore represent the initial effects of replication in a more hostile internal cellular environment than to be found in a better co-oadapted virus-tolerised immune system of a bat 34 zoonotic origins are suspected for other human coronaviruses but at more remote times 35  perhaps they have taken their mutational and adaptive

martina bianchi stefano pascarella roberto cauda massimo ciccozzi antonio cassone   sars-cov-2 is the agent of covid-19 a new coronavirus infection recently declared pandemic by the who which causes severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards1 as of march 16th more than 150000 cases of covid-19 have been notified while most cases have occurred in mainland china and other asiatic countries the virus has also spread to europe particularly italy where it has caused more than thousand deaths and is overstressing the national health system the sars-cov-2 genome has been intensely investigated for diagnostics and pathogenicity insights into this virus as well as to trace its evolution presently more than 350 sequences of virus isolated from several countries are shared in gisaid database studies have highlighted the basic structure of the rna genome its probable source from a bat coronavirus at wuhan food and wild animal market with or without a still unidentified secondary animal host and the rather close similarity in viral sequences of isolates from different patients2 however interpretation of genome-driven virus evolution has remained difficult because the published data do still refer to a relatively low number of viral isolates most of which from china and few ones from other countries in particular there is little information about the evolutionary impact of the few mutations that have been reported by various authors we have here examined all available sars-cov-2 sequences with the aim of mapping structural variations of this new coronavirus genome and the patterns of selection if any of viral protein genes we describe the presence of two mutations affecting the non-structural protein 6 nsp6 and the open reading frame10 orf 10 adjacent aminoacidic regions of sars-cov-2 and discuss their potential relevance for virus-host interaction particularly virus-induced cellular autophagy no specific funding source has been received a maximum likelihood tree using hkyg4 model has been built and results have been compared with epidemiological information sequences from several different countries have been found in the same clusters while sequences from the same countries have not been found in the same cluster no separated clade is evident but all the sequences are part of the same clade the mutation on the amino acid position 3691 does not appear to be associated within the same cluster with sequences with a leucine on the residue position 9659 moreover 3 sequences have been found to have a mutation on both the 3691 and the 9659 amino acidic positions sequences with a histidine on the position 9659 have been found to belong to distinct clusters at any rate clustering of sequence presenting amino acidic mutations did not indicate geographicalepidemiological link with the patients from whom sars-cov-2 was isolated supplementary fig 1 no reliable homology model could be built using swissmodel and hhpred servers for this reason the three-dimensional model of nsp6 has been downloaded from i-tasser website httpszhanglabccmbmedumicheduc-i-tasser2019-ncovqhd434156pdbgz the structural analysis performed using tmhmm and protter servers have shown that nsp6 protein has 7 putative trans-membrane helices like in other coronaviruses19
 the meme analysis has shown evidence for episodic synonymous mutations mostly concerning the 3rd codon and not impacting on the overall proteomic asset of the virus regarding the fel analysis the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure have been found on 2 sites on the amino acidic positions 3691 and 9659 these mutations fall on nsp6 and on a region near the open reading frame 10 orf 10 respectively the amino acidic change stability acs analysis has shown that both mutations lead to a lower stability of the protein structures namely at amino acid position 3691 corresponding to nsp6 position 37 most of the sars-cov-2 sequences have a leucine residue while some more recent sequences from asia america oceania and europe isolates show phenylalanine table 1
 both amino acids are non-polar but phenylalanine has a benzoic ring in the side chain which may stiffen the secondary structure by means of aromatic-aromatic hydrophobic or stacking interactions the acs analysis has shown that this mutation lead to a lower stability of the protein structure fig 1 the mutant position is predicted to be at the c-terminal side of the first transmembrane helix corresponding to the first outer membrane site close to a sequence region rich of phenylalanine residues from nsp6 residue position 32 to 40 slffffyena of sars-cov-2 fig 1 b according to the structural model the mutant position is part of a constellation of aromatic residues which includes in addition to the sequentially contiguous residues trp31 phe42 and phe45 fig 2 jpred attributes a helical conformation also to the cytosolic portion of the segment connecting the first to the second transmembrane helix which may facilitate hydrophobic interactions among these aromatic residues at the amino acidic position 9659 corresponding to orf 10 position 3 o 4 most of the sars-cov-2 sequences have an arginine residue while some sequences from australia and america isolates have a histidine residue the bgm analysis has highlighted the presence of co-evolution between the amino acidic position 9375 and the position 9659 table 2
 both amino acids are polar but histidine has an imidazole side chain that suggests a more rigid secondary structure in fact acs analysis has shown that this mutation leads to a lower stability of the protein structure on the same position other sequences of sars-cov-2 isolates from australia and new zealand have shown the presence of a non-polar leucine aminoacidic residue table 3
 also in this case the mutation leads to a lower stability of the protein structure as indicated by acs analysis in this paper we have examined all available genome sequences 352 of the recently emerged new coronavirus sars-cov-2 which causes a dreadful pneumonia pandemic termed covid-19 19 this virus has infected so far more than 120000 subjects worldwide with several thousand casualties almost all countries have been affected and some of them are now experiencing a rampant rise of disease cases with severe consequences on the stability of health systems since disease probable emergence in a wet market of wuhan city in the hubei region of china and recognition of its causative agent a number of studies on sars-cov-2 genome have been published and showed its close similarities and differences with the genomes of other coronaviruses isolated from bat snake pangolin and sars cov20 21 22
 now the attention of most investigators is focused on the potential capability of the viral genome to evolve through mutation recombination and gene gain and losses as verified in other human coronaviruses23 despite contrary expectations the selective pressure analysis reported here points out that the genome of sars-cov-2 has so far undergone very few mutations which mostly affect the 3rd codon and are synonymous meaning are not going to influence the general molecular structure of this new virus in addition it remains difficult to prove the biological relevance of these mutations by pure bioinformatic approach in the absence of experimental correlates to somewhat overcome these difficulties we have here joined bioinformatic and phylogenetic with structural analysis of sars-cov-2 protein encoded by mutated genes in an attempt to obtain some insights into the biological significance and plausibility of the noted mutations we posit that some of these mutations can provide the virus with useful adaptations in its fight to persist and multiply within humans we have particularly assessed two sars-cov-2 mutations of non-structural viral proteins nsp6 and an aminoacidic region near orf 10 with particular interest into the former protein nsp6 a common component of both  and -coronaviruses locates to the endoplasmic reticulum er and generates autophagosomes24 we notice that the presence of multiple phenylalanine residues in the outer membrane region of nsp6 should favor the affinity between this region and the er membrane inducing a more stable binding of the protein to er it has been shown that this binding may favor coronavirus infection by compromising the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation25 thus its role would be to limit autophagosome expansion directly or indirectly by starvation or chemical inhibition of mtor signaling26 nonetheless the role of autophagy in viral infection is a double-edge sword and we dont have direct evidence that nsp6 mutation does in fact favor viral replication and evasion from cellular immunity or the opposite in this context it should be noted that mutational protein analysis speaks for a lower stability of nsp6 upon changing phenylalanine from leucine but it should be considered that acs analysis doesnt consider trans-membrane position and other protein interactions regarding the aminoacidic region near the orf 10 previous studies performed on the sars-cov reported a 29 nucleotides deletion segment disrupting orf 9 and simultaneously eliminating orfs 10 and 11 the clinical significance of this deletion is unclear also because it has been found to co-exist with the non-deleted variant in the same host and same clinical specimen 25 a comparison of data from evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis leads us to hypothesize that the mutations are probably unrelated to a strain or a sub-family of the covid-19 but are due to independent converging evolution of the virus that promote these changes in the viral genome in conclusion the analysis of a relatively wide database of sars-cov-2 genomes of worldwide isolates representative of covid-19 from the start of epidemic in china up to the recent virus spread to european countries has revealed only two synonymous mutations nonetheless we here speculate that one of these two mutations ie the nsp6 could bring to some appreciable change in the expression of sars-cov-2 relationship with its host particularly concerning a critical host anti-viral defense such as the autophagic lysosomal machinery

mutagenesis and replication studies we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-41 shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-42 sensitivity structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses 43 including all 7 human coronaviruses suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this 44 horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new non-active-site regulatory 45 region of the nsp5 3clpro protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors 46 47 48 49 in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 emerged in humans and triggered a 50 pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of covid-19 across 51 more than 180 countries and territories june 2020 sars-cov-2 represents the third emergent 52 coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans 53 remains certain critically there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of 54 covid-19 the coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded 55 enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design however past attempts to target the 56 active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-57 active-site targets for therapeutic development this study describes the discovery of a novel 58 conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv 59 which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development 60 61 introduction 62 63 coronaviruses covs are enveloped positive-strand rna viruses which encode among the 64 largest rna virus genomes on the planet and infect a wide range of organisms including 65 humans to date 7 human coronaviruses hcovs have been identified which include 4 hcovs 66 associated with seasonal common colds hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 and hcov-67  we used a combination of alanine-scanning mutagenesis and c-terminal additions and deletions 187 to initially mutate the mhv nsp5 idl  table 1  of the 16 amino acids comprising the loop a 188 total of 8 virus mutants were successfully recovered p184a r186a a188i v190i v191i 189 p194a q196a and y198a 5 amino acid residues failed to permit virus recovery despite 190 multiple attempts at rescue y185a d187a q189a q192a and t199a and 3 amino acid 191 residues were not evaluated l193 v195 and d197 among the unrecovered mutants 192 additional attempts to rescue using more conservative amino acid substitutions at residues d187 193 d187e and q192 q192n were also unsuccessful a total of four different c-terminal 194 modifications were also attempted which included 2 different c-terminal additions a 195 duplication of residues 197 -199 and a duplication of residue 199 and 2 different c-terminal 196 deletions a deletion of residues 197 -199 and a deletion of residue 199 all four of these c-197 terminal modifications to the nsp5 idl failed to permit virus recovery 198 199 analyses of plaque formation replication and protease activity reveal a novel 200 temperature-sensitive mutant in the mhv nsp5 idl to evaluate the replication kinetics of 201 each of the recovered mhv nsp5 idl mutants we infected confluent dbt-9 cells with an moi 202 of 001 of each of the idl mutants and titered aliquots over a 24 h period  fig 2a  all 8 203 recovered mhv idl mutants exhibited indistinguishable replication kinetics compared to wt 204 mhv previously we described a total of 3 separate temperature-sensitive mutations tsv148a 205 tss133a and tsf219l in the mhv nsp5 protease whose phenotypes could be suppressed 206 through long-distance second-site suppressor mutations 28 29 42 to evaluate whether any of 207 the recovered mhv nsp5 idl mutants may exhibit a temperature-sensitive phenotype we 208 performed an efficiency of plating eop analysis by comparing the titers of each idl virus by 209 plaque assay determined at a physiologic 37c and elevated temperature 40c fig 3a  210 average eop values were determined by the average ratios of titers at 40c compared to 37c 211 with those eop values less than 10 -1 indicating a greater than 10-fold reduction in titers at the 212 elevated temperature as being temperature-sensitive ts wt mhv exhibited an average eop of 213 76 x 10 -1  in contrast previously described ts nsp5 mutant virus s133a exhibited an average 214 eop of 149 x 10 -4  consistent with the eop previously reported 29 two separate mhv nsp5 215 idl mutants exhibited average eop values less than 10 -1 and were significantly lower than wt 216 mhv p005 p184a and r186a mutant p184a exhibited an average eop of 139 x 10 -2  in 217 contrast idl mutant r186a resulted in a much lower average eop of 76 x 10 -4  which was not 218 significantly different from the known ts mutant s133a no other idl mutants exhibited average 219 eops significantly different from wt mhv these data suggested that mutagenesis of two 220 separate idl residues p184a and r186a have resulted in novel temperature-sensitive 221 phenotypes to determine whether the observed differences in phenotype for idl mutants 222 p184a and r186a are due specifically to defects in nsp5 protease activity or some other long-223 distance effect we performed a western blot to evaluate the ability for the p184a and r186a 224 nsp5 proteases to process the maturation cleavage of a downstream replicase pp1ab protein 225 nsp8 during virus replication fig 3b  lysates from wt- p184a- and r186a-infected dbt-9 226 cells were compared for nsp5-mediated nsp8 processing at 37c compared to 40c wt-mhv 227 and p184a exhibited approximately equivalent levels ratios of 108 and 099 respectively of 228 nsp8 protein detected at both temperatures consistent with its temperature-sensitive eop virus 229 mutant r186a exhibited reduced nsp8 protein detected at 40c compared to 37c ratio of 078 230 and when normalized to wt exhibited an approximate 27 reduction in mature nsp8 protein 231 produced at the elevated temperature these data demonstrate that mhv nsp5 idl mutation 232 r186a is associated with reduced nsp5 activity at 40c whereas no appreciable difference in 233 processing at 40c was detected for mutant p184a 234 to assess the impact of elevated temperature on replication of the recovered mhv idl mutant 236 viruses we repeated the moi 001 replication assay in dbt-9 cells at 40c fig 2b  in contrast 237 to replication at 37c the replication kinetics among the mhv idl strains were far more 238 variable with most strains exhibiting a delay in logarithmic growth compared to wt mhv 239 mutant p184a which had shown a temperature-sensitive eop of 139 x 10 -2  failed to exhibit 240 replication kinetics that were significantly different for wild-type or the other mhv idl strains 241 in contrast mutant strain r186a showed significantly delayed replication kinetics to reach the 242 maximal logarithmic growth rate p005 compared to wt mhv consistent with its 243 temperature-sensitive eop of 76 x 10 -4  collectively these data indicate that mutant r186a 244 exhibits both significantly reduced capacity to form plaques and delayed replication kinetics at 245 the elevated temperature of 40c compared to wt mhv 246 247 reversion analysis of ts mhv nsp5 idl mutant r186a reveals three compensatory second-248 site suppressor mutations to identify potential interacting residues and novel regulatory 249 networks within the mhv nsp5 protease associated with residue r186 we performed reversion 250 analysis at 40c by expanding and sequencing formed plaques at the inhibitory temperature  fig  251 4a a total of 10 plaques were selected at expanded in t25 flasks for virus collection and 252 sequencing of these 6 of these plaques resulted in the original r186a mutant virus while 3 of 253 these plaques yielded r186a in addition to one of each of three different second-site putative 254 suppressor mutations in nsp5 p184s l141v and l141i fig 4b  additional sequencing was 255 performed on these 3 recovered viruses throughout the orf1ab coding region and no other 256 mutations were identified the p184s mutation arose within the mhv nsp5 idl while residue 257 l141 is located on the same loop housing the c145 catalytic residue of the active site 258 to evaluate whether the emergence of these second-site suppressor mutations aids in viral 260 growth at 40c an eop analysis was performed using these viruses at 37c and 40c fig 4c  bottom part of the binding pocket for residues p2 -p5 of the substrate fig 5a and b  280 modeling using the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 residues d187 and t188 formed a distinct 281 pocket in and around the p2 residue of leu residues t188 and q189 establish the back wall of 282 the p3 binding pocket and residues q189 t190 and q192 are responsible for forming the back 283 q189 and t190 and base q192 of the p4 and p5 binding pockets 284 285 among the mhv idl mutants which failed to rescue were d187a q189a and q192a amino 286 acid residues d187 and q192 are structurally conserved in all sequenced nsp5 proteases to date 287  fig 1b  both d187 and q192 are located in a conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the n-288 terminus of the idl the d187 side chain projects from the top of the horseshoe-shaped region 289 towards domain 1 and the protease active site and forms the inner wall pocket for the p2 binding 290 site in an alignment of the d187 residues of mhv sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-291 2 the positioning and orientation of the side chain are highly conserved with predicted polar 292 contacts with two additional highly conserved residues r40 which is immediately adjacent to 293 the catalytic h41 and y54 fig 5c  the q192 side chain is conserved in its positioning 294 towards the center of the horseshoe-shaped region where it shares predicted polar contacts with 295 several other idl residues including a188 and r186 in mhv r186 and r188 in sars-cov-296 2 k191 in mers-cov and t190 in sars-cov fig 5d including the current sars-cov-2 pandemic which collectively highlight both the importance 308 for rapid development of effective therapeutics for the treatment of covid-19 but also the need 309 to be prepared for potential future coronavirus outbreaks in the present study we evaluated the 310 structure and function of the nsp5 protease idl a poorly studied and structurally conserved 311 region of the protease using site-directed mutagenesis we demonstrated that some residues and 312 regions of the protease were capable of accepting mutations without apparent defects in viral 313 replication however a number of residues mostly located within a horseshoe-shaped region in 314 the n-terminus of the protease either failed to permit virus recovery or resulted in a viral 315 temperature-sensitivity of the 16 amino acid residues comprising the loop we were able to 316 successfully recover viral mutants at 8 different locations  table 1  317 318 despite the overall structural conservation of the entirety of the loop the majority of these 319 mutations resulted in no apparent defects in viral replication compared to wt a few of these 320 residues a188 v190 and v191 with no apparent viral defects are known to form the basis of 321 part of the p3 -p5 substrate binding pockets of the protease 24 26 yet compared to the rest of the idl these residue positions showed among the least sequence conservation figure 1b  323 which may explain the plasticity with which these residues could tolerate mutagenesis as well as 324 cleavage site variability among coronaviruses 16 similarly more c-terminal residues p194 325 q196 and y198 are also found in more variable sequence locations within the idl collectively 326 these 8 residue positions may simply represent flexible linker residues than serving additional 327 structural supportive or enzymatic roles within the protease 328 329 residues p184 and r186 while rescued when mutated to alanine amino acids exhibited reduced 330 capacity to form plaques at 40c p184 is found at a bend leading into the horseshoe shaped 331 region of the idl and may be responsible for helping stabilize the n-terminal anchor of the loop 332 within domain 2 replication analysis and western blots of the p184a mutant virus failed to 333 show significant differences from wt mhv however the selection of a p184s mutation in 334 reversion analysis of r186a may suggest that these two residues represent stabilizing and 335 interacting nodes within the protease figure 4b  we previously described 3 different 336 temperature-sensitive mutations in mhv-a59 s133a v148a and f219l which all shared 337 overlapping compensatory second-site suppressor mutations 28 29 42 all 3 viruses selected 338 for an h134y mutation while the temperature-sensitive v148a mutation selected for an s133n 339 mutation furthermore second-site mutations were identified for f219l which were located 340 greater than 20  away from the initial mutation p184a is located on an adjacent loop in 341 domain 2 to both s133 and h134 less than 6  in distance not shown mhv viral mutant 342 r186a was found to exhibit delayed replication kinetics figure 2  reduced capacity to form 343 plaques figure 3  and reduced nsp5-mediated proteolytic processing at the elevated 344 temperature of 40c consistent with a temperature-sensitive phenotype figure 3  perhaps surprising the r186 residue position was the most variable and least conserved structurally 346 among all 7 hcovs evaluated  figure 1b  structural analysis of the mhv sars-cov sars-347 cov-2 and mers-cov revealed that the side chain of the 100 conserved q192 appears to 348 form conserved polar interactions with the backbone amino and carboxyl termini of the residue 349 186 position figure 5d  these data may suggest that q192 is stabilized within the horseshoe 350 show a high level of amino acid conservation with two of these residues d187 and q192 being 372 100 conserved across all known coronavirus nsp5 protease sequences to date figure 1b  all 373 four of these residues are found within a conserved horseshoe-shaped region within the n-374 terminus of the nsp5 idl we propose that this horseshoe-shaped region is a critical region of 375 the protease for both structure and function based on the following observations 1 residues with the catalytic dyad h41 and c145 residues labeled predicted polar contacts 607 between q192 and other residues of the idl are shown sars-cov has an additional and 608 unique predicted polar interaction with t190 shown in red   complete genomic sequences a key residue in the spike protein and deletions in nonstructural protein 3b of us strains of the virulent and attenuated coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus xinsheng zhang mustafa hasoksuz david spiro rebecca halpin shiliang wang sarah stollar daniel janies nagesh hadya yuxin tang elodie ghedin linda saif   transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev is a group 1 coronavirus it was identified as an etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis in swine in 1946 in the united states doyle 1951 doyle lp 1946 and in the following two decades after its discovery it was reported in england belgium japan china australia and africa kemeny and woods 1977 pritchard 1987 wood et al 1981 woods 1976 woods and wesley 1986 transmissible gastroenteritis virus replicates in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells in the small intestine leading to severe villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhea resulting in almost 100 mortality in seronegative suckling pigs saif and sestak 2006 the virus is an enteropathogen although tgev also replicates in the upper respiratory tract underdahl et al 1975 with transient nasal shedding in experimentally inoculated pigs vancott et al 1993 transmissible gastroenteritis virus has a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of  285 kb in size the genomic sequence contains 9 open-reading frames orfs that encode 4 structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleoprotein n and 5 nonstructural proteins replicase 1a and 1b 3a 3b and protein 7 arranged on the genome in the order 5-replicase 1a1b-s-3a-3b-e-m-n-7-3 the s glycoprotein of tgev forms large petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion which are responsible for binding to specific receptors on the membranes of susceptible cells aminopeptidase n apn is the major cell surface receptor for tgev delmas et al 1992 and several co-receptors including sialoglycoproteins have been implicated in conferring enteric tropism to tgev ballesteros et al 1997 delmas et al 1993 four major antigenic sites a b c and d were characterized on the n terminus of the s protein using monoclonal antibodies correa et al 1988 delmas et al 1986 delmas et al 1990 simkins et al 1992 monoclonal antibodies against s can neutralize virus infectivity either by blocking virus attachment to cells or through interfering with virus endocytosis or membrane fusion sune et al 1990 the adjacent sites a and b were mapped to a region of approximately 200 amino acids beginning from residue 506 as its n terminal boundary godet et al 1994 antigenic sites ab also overlap with the domain of the s protein encompassing amino acids 522744 that mediate aminopeptidase n apn receptor binding godet et al 1994 three antigenic sites were also defined in the n protein martin alonso et al 1992 simkins et al 1989 after continuous passage in cell culture tgev isolates gradually lose their virulence and viral tropisms may shift from enteric to respiratory furuuchi et al 1978 harada et al 1969 attenuation and tropism shift can also occur in nature an example being the naturally occurring s gene deletion mutant the porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv which has both reduced pathogenicity and a predominantly respiratory tropism pensaert et al 1986 saif and sestak 2006 wesley et al 1990a wesley et al 1990b in contrast to tgev prcv mainly infects the respiratory tract causing mild to moderate pneumonia often with pronounced interstitial lung lesions but with little or no replication in the intestine studies of prcv have provided some insight into the determinants for the tropism and virulence changes in tgev at the genome level prcv and tgev share high nucleotide sequence identity except that prcv has a deletion in the 5 end of the s gene and deletions in orf3 the latter leading to lack of or a truncated protein expressed the 5 deletion in the s gene is widely believed to play a major role in the altered tissue tropism of prcv wesley et al 1990a wesley et al 1990b wesley et al 1991 ballesteros et al 1997 and sanchez et al 1999 identified two domains in the spike protein of attenuated tgev purdue strain pur46-mad responsible for binding apn and co-receptors and demonstrated that a respiratory purdue type tgev ptv formerly known as neb72 lost the co-receptor binding site due to the s gene mutation point mutations in the spike gene leading to a shift from enteric to respiratory tropism were also found in high cell culture passaged tgev strain toy56 sanchez et al 1992 thus the spike protein has been recognized as not only a tropism but also a virulence determinant although it is generally accepted that deletions in the spike and orf3 genes contribute to tropism change and attenuation of prcv other genes may also be involved for instance amino acid mutations in the m protein affect the ability of attenuated purdue tgev p115 to induce ifn-alpha implying a potential role for the m protein in altered host response and virulence laude et al 1992 other evidence has implicated a role for nonstructural proteins 3a and 3b in determining virulence of these swine enteric and respiratory coronaviruses paul et al 1997 an infectious clone of tgev purdue strain pur46-mad with orf3 gene deletions showed a slightly reduced pathogenicity in vivo but normal replication in cell culture sola et al 2003 similar effects of orf3 deletion were also observed for the group 3 coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus hodgson and cavanagh 2006 shen et al 2003 however in one study a tgev strain 961933 with a deletion in orf3a was demonstrated to maintain enteric virulence mcgoldrick et al 1999 suggesting that orf3a is not essential for virulence although the virulence of this virus needs to be further confirmed because the virus isolated and sequenced was not plaque purified and was not tested in pigs after plaque purification to determine the molecular basis for tgev attenuation we analyzed the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of structural and nonstructural proteins of two virulentattenuated tgev pairs as well as the prcv strain isu-1 determining tropism and virulence factors at the genomic level for tgevprcv strains should enhance our understanding of the evolution of coronaviruses including the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 saif 2004 saif 2005 sequencing reads were downloaded trimmed to remove amplicon primer-linker sequences as well as low quality sequence and assembled using tigr assembler wwwtigrorgsoftwareassembler to close gaps between assembled contigs strain-specific primers were designed rt-pcr was performed and amplicons were sequenced as described in materials and methods additional primer design cdna synthesis and sequencing were performed to ensure greater than 4 sequence coverage along the coronavirus genomes assemblies were manually edited using cloe closure editor a tigr program for editing assemblies all apparent polymorphisms were checked against reference data and ambiguities were analyzed by rt-pcr and cloning the final genome assemblies have been deposited in genbank the genbank accession numbers are as follows virulent tgev miller m6dq811785 attenuated tgev miller m60 dq811786 prcv-isu-1 dq811787 attenuated tgev purdue p115 dq811788 virulent tgev purdue dq811789 the genome lengths in nt for tgev virulent miller m6 attenuated miller m60 virulent purdue attenuated purdue p115 and prcv-isu-1 are 28542 27915 28577 28571 and 27546 respectively genome sequence alignment of the tgev strains and prcv with the reference genome sequence of tgev strain pur46-mad from genbank accession number nc002306 showed comparable genome size and identical gene order all 5 genomes start with 5 untranslated regions similar to that of the reference strain above and end with a polya tail except that the sequence for m60 is 69 nt short of reaching the polya end the tgev and prcv strains share high genomic sequence identities ranging from 962 to 999 table 1
 pur46-mad and purdue p115 showed 999 genomic sequence similarity because tgev pur46-mad strain was derived from tgev purdue p115 and similarly attenuated from the virulent tgev purdue strain after high passage in cell culture penzes et al 2001 sanchez et al 1992 the 5 genomes contained 8 to 9 open-reading frames orfs typical of other tgev and prcv strains the length in amino acids of the structural and nonstructural proteins of the four tgev strains and prcv-isu-1 is summarized in table 2
 no protein 3a is encoded in prcv-isu-1 due to a 184 nt deletion at the 5 end of the 3a gene each viral assembly was analyzed using viral genome orf reader vigor a program designed at tigr to predict viral protein sequences using vigor we checked segment length alignments with reference sequences fidelity of reading frames correlated amino acid mutations with nucleotide polymorphisms and detected potential sequence errors the open-reading frames of the structural and nonstructural proteins of the four tgev strains were aligned using the clustalw algorithm to identify amino changes after attenuation comparison of individual proteins from each of the tgev isolates revealed a number of deletions insertions and point mutations that are summarized in table 3
 a total of 20 amino acid point mutations were found in miller m60 and 32 point mutations were found in purdue p115 when compared to their virulent counterparts table 3 a schematic illustration of spike gene changes and deletions in tgev isolates and prcv is presented in fig 1
 the most striking variation between attenuated and virulent isolates was seen in the spike and orf3a3b genes large deletions were present in the spike gene of prcv-isu-1 and in the orf3 gene of both prcv-isu-1 and m60 table 3 table 4
 a 3 nt deletion was present in the s gene of miller m60 from 23852387 resulting in a spike protein of 1448 aa in length 1 aa shorter compared to miller m6 in purdue p115 there was a 6 nt deletion in the s gene leading to a spike protein 2 aa shorter than virulent purdue strain 1447 vs 1449 aa sequence analysis confirmed the previously reported 681 nt deletion in the 5 end of the s gene in prcv-isu-1 bae et al 1991 wesley et al 1991 a common t virulent tgev strains to g mutation for both m60 and purdue p115 was located at nt 1753 of the spike genes the prcv-isu-1 strain had a g at the corresponding nucleotide position this mutation that resulted in a serine to alanine mutation at aa 585 of the spike protein was the only common amino acid change found between both the miller and purdue strains after attenuation because the alanine residue was also observed at the corresponding position 585 in the spike protein of prcv-isu-1 it may represent a genetic marker of attenuation among tgev and prcv strains but further analysis using reverse genetics and experimental animal studies is needed to confirm this possibility the orf3a3b deletions are represented schematically in fig 2a prcv-isu-1 showed a 184 nt deletion in the orf3a gene disrupting the predicted open-reading frame of nonstructural protein 3a a 3 nt deletion upstream and a 5 nt deletion downstream of the 184 nt deletion were also found furthermore prcv-isu-1 contained a 117 nt in frame deletion in orf3b gene leading to a shorter nonstructural protein 3b relative to tgev strains sequence comparison of orf3 genes between the miller and purdue strains revealed 2 large deletions 16 and 29 nt respectively in the orf3a gene of the miller strains a previously undescribed 29 nt deletion was also present in prcv-isu-1 at exactly the same position as miller strains when compared to purdue strains miller m60 had a 531 nt in frame deletion in orf3b gene resulting in a truncated 3b protein of 67 aa long the deletion in m60 orf3b gene was noted previously by our laboratory kwon et al 1998 and was independently confirmed in this study by rt-pcr and sequence analysis data not shown interestingly these deletions occur at the same amino acid position aa 33 in the predicted polypeptides of m60 and prcv-isu-1 fig 2b the apparent recombination point in the nucleotide sequence occurs within 2 nucleotides of each other as determined by clustalw alignment fig 2c analysis of the 3 end of the viral genomes revealed four genes encoding e m n and protein 7 no deletions or insertions were present in e n and protein 7 genes the deduced e and n proteins and protein 7 among the 5 viruses were 82 aa 382 aa and 78 aa respectively there was a small variation in m protein size with m60 having a 6 nt insertion in the m gene when compared to the other 3 tgev strains leading to a membrane protein 2 aa longer than those of m6 and purdue strains 264 aa and 262 aa respectively the prcv-isu-1 had a 3 nt deletion in the m gene resulting in an m protein of 261 aa about two thirds of the tgev genome encodes the replicase genes 1a and 1b the replicase genes are relatively conserved and no major deletions and insertions were present in both the miller and purdue isolates the replicase 1a gene was predicted to encode a protein of 4017 aa and the replicase 1b gene was predicted to encode a protein of 2680 aa comparison of the predicted polypeptide sequences indicated 4 aa changes in replicase 1a and 2 aa changes in replicase 1b for the m6m60 pair twelve aa changes in replicase 1a and 1 aa change in replicase 1b were identified for virulent purduep115 pair table 3 however no common changes were found between the two pairs after attenuation two short deletions were seen in the replicase 1a gene of prcv-isu-1 6 nt from nt 3252 to 3257 and 3 nt from nt 3331 to 3333 respectively when compared to miller and purdue strains more sequence differences were found between prcv-isu-1 and tgev strains than between tgev miller and purdue strains tgev virulent miller m6 shared 989 genomic sequence identity with virulent purdue strain prcv-isu-1 had 980 and 976 genomic sequence identities with m6 and virulent purdue respectively the high sequence homology among tgev strains and prcv-isu-1 suggests these viruses are closely related but prcv-isu-1 has a closer relationship with tgev miller strains than purdue strains to identify differences at the aa level individual proteins of miller and purdue strains were compared amino acids of prcv-isu-1 at divergent positions were also listed table 4 proteins of prcv-isu-1 were more biased toward miller strains than purdue strains including s protein 3a3b e m n and protein 7 sequence comparisons at both genomic and protein levels indicated that prcv-isu-1 had a closer relationship with tgev miller strains than purdue strains to further define the ancestry relatedness of prcv-isu-1 to tgev stains phylogenetic analysis of prcv-isu-1 was performed against the 4 tgev strains and pur46-mad genomic sequence available in genbank accession number nc002306 the phylogenetic tree was rooted with a feline coronavirus accession number nc 007025 as an outgroup the tree showed that miller m6 and miller m60 were most closely related with each other consistent with the fact that both m6 and m60 are derived from miller strain fig 3
 purdue p115 clustered most closely with pur46-mad and together these two purdue strains shared the closest relationship with virulent purdue pur46-mad strain is a derivative of the tgev purdue-p115 strain and both strains were derived from the virulent purdue strain penzes et al 2001 sanchez et al 1999 the tree also revealed that all tgev strains were clustered into one clade indicating tgev strains share a common ancestor and as a group tgev strains share a common ancestor with prcv-isu-1 fig 3 we completed the entire genomic sequences of two virulentattenuated tgev pairs and the isu-1 strain of prcv although partial sequences of these strains were available in genbank to our knowledge this is the first report of the full genomic sequence of these pairs of viruses in comparison to one another and to a prcv strain the detailed comparison of the sequences of the 2 virulent and attenuated tgev pairs aids in the identification of the genetic basis of coronavirus attenuation which has not yet been clearly established and provides targets for verification of the role of such changes using infectious clones of tgev sequences for tgev genomes in public databases are lacking before the present study there were only three complete genomic sequences of any tgev strains in genbank accession number nc002306 dq443743 and dq201447 addition of the full genomic sequences for these 5 viruses will aid in understanding animal coronaviruses including their genetic structure diversity and evolution the sequence analyses identified deletions that were reported previously including the 6 nt deletion in the s gene of the purdue p115 compared to the virulent purdue strain rasschaert and laude 1987 and 2 large deletions 16 and 29 nt respectively in the orf3a gene of the miller strains when compared to the purdue strains rasschaert et al 1987 wesley et al 1989 alignment of the genome sequences of the two virulentattenuated pairs of tgev strains revealed a common change at nt 1753 of the spike gene resulting in a serine to alanine mutation in aa position 585 of the spike protein of the attenuated strains this was the only common change at the protein level found in the attenuated viruses in comparison to their virulent counterparts interestingly the naturally attenuated prcv-isu-1 also has an alanine residue at the corresponding position this suggests that the alanine in place of serine may be a genetic marker for attenuation of tgev strains and for prcv which is also attenuated for pigs a study by sanchez et al 1992 revealed that all tgev strains analyzed had an alanine at aa 585 of the spike protein except for mil65-ame the mil65-ame strain so designated by enjuanes and colleagues is a derivative of our virulent miller strain as demonstrated penzes et al 2001 it was the only virulent enteric tgev strain analyzed in their study and the other strains were either respiratory or attenuated by high passage through tissue culture a phenotypic change in tgev resulting from a similar single nucleotide change at a different site in the spike protein has been reported previously in a prior study ballesteros et al 1997 and sanchez et al 1999 identified a g residue at nt position 655 of the spike protein that was essential to maintain enteric tropism of tgev strain pur46-mad mutations at this nucleotide caused a shift from enteric to respiratory tropism of this virus the 6 nt nt 1122 to 1127 aa 375376 deletion in the attenuated tgev purdue p115 spike gene but not in the virulent purdue strain that we observed may also play a role in its attenuation penzes et al 2001 observed the same deletion in the spike gene of attenuated purdue strains pur46-c8 and pur46-mad but not in the in vivo maintained virulent strain pur46-c11 the serine to alanine mutation at aa 585 is located in the major antigenic sites ab of tgev spike proteins and within the binding site for receptor apn delmas et al 1986 delmas et al 1990 suggesting that this change may have a significant influence in the receptor binding or neutralizing antibody interactions single amino acid changes in the spike protein of coronaviruses can have significant effects on antigenicity for example a single amino acid change in the antigenic domain ii of the spike protein confers resistance to neutralization of a bovine coronavirus yoo and deregt 2001 the alanine residue is also present at the corresponding position in the spike protein of prcv-isu-1 antigenic site ab has been mapped from aa 506 to 706 of the spike protein godet et al 1994 within this region there were 2 aa changes for m60 as compared to m6 and 4 aa changes for purdue p115 as compared to virulent purdue however the impact of the serine to alanine mutation on pig pathogenicity awaits generation of recombinant viruses by reverse genetics followed by their testing in vivo although researchers have indicated that deletions in orf3 may be involved in the virulence of tgev paul et al 1997 and deletion of orf3 gene in a recombinant tgev virus showed a limited effect on the viral virulence in vivo sola et al 2003 only one mutation but no deletions and insertions was found in the orf3a and orf3b proteins of the attenuated purdue tgev p115 when compared to the virulent purdue tgev and no mutations in orf3 proteins were shared in the two virulentattenuated pairs it is noteworthy that we predicted the existence of protein 3b of virulent and attenuated purdue tgev viruses using the vigor program others suggested that the mrna encoding protein 3b was not observed in tgev purdue but only in miller strains using infected cell lysates and northern blot analysis izeta et al 1999 penzes et al 2001 and therefore described it as a pseudogene in tgev purdue strains a mutation was found in the highly conserved core sequence cs previously known as intergenic sequence is within coronavirus transcription regulatory motif 5-cuaaac-3 preceding orf3b genes of the tgev purdue strains this mutation replaced the last nucleotide c in cs with u because the cs represents signals for coronavirus transcription of subgenomic mrnas lai and cavanagh 1997 sawicki and sawicki 1990 it is speculated that the mutation renders the mrna encoding the 3b protein undetectable by northern blot for tgev purdue strains however the single mutation in the cs preceding the orf3b gene of tgev purdue viruses may not completely abolish its transcription it has been demonstrated that a core sequence differing at the last nucleotide from the canonical one 5-cuaaac-3 maintains efficient transcription for the downstream gene sola et al 2003 because we observed this mutation in the cs of orf3b gene for both virulent purdue and attenuated purdue p115 strains protein 3b is unlikely to play a role in the attenuation of tgev purdue strains similarly the absence of mutations or deletions in the nonstructural protein 7 of the virulentattenuated purdue tgev pair indicates that changes in this protein alone are unlikely to be involved in the attenuation process although evidence suggests that deletion of the entire orf7 gene resulted in altered in vivo replication and virulence of tgev based on a recombinant pur46-mad virus ortego et al 2003 due to lack of proof-reading activity of the virally encoded rna-dependent rna polymerase coronaviruses introduce frequent mutations into their genomes during replication in addition to randomly generated mutations rna recombination can also occur when multiple distinct coronavirus species infect the same host the occurrence of frequent genomic changes leads to generation of new coronaviruses that can have altered pathogenicity different tissue tropism or ability to cross host species barrier an example is the sars outbreak caused by a previously unidentified coronavirus sars-cov recent studies identified bats as the likely natural reservoir of sars-cov the sars-cov-like coronaviruses of bats may have potentially become adapted to humans through genomic mutation and recombination events either directly or via intermediate hosts civet cats etc hampton 2005 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 normile 2005 although occurrence of sars surprised the medical community the relevance of rna recombination and mutation to animal coronavirus evolution and tropism shift had been previously well recognized for tgev and prcv strains saif 2004 saif 2005 saif and sestak 2006 sanchez et al 1992 the independent appearance of prcv in both europe and the united states in the 1989s highlighted the possible emergence of new coronavirus strains with altered tissue tropism virulence or host specificity due to genomic deletion and mutation events the european prcv strains characterized had a 672 nt deletion in the same position within the s gene suggesting they evolved from the same predecessor callebaut et al 1988 sanchez et al 1990 sanchez et al 1992 however the initial prcv strains detected in the united states had deletions of 681 nt in size kwon et al 1998 wesley et al 1991 subsequently other prcv strains were isolated that varied in the size of the spike gene deletion halbur et al 1993 kim et al 2000 vaughn et al 1994 nevertheless deletions in the s genes disrupt expression of antigenic sites on s proteins of both european and american prcv strains as a result tgev and prcv can be serologically differentiated by monoclonal antibodies to the two antigenic sites callebaut et al 1988 simkins et al 1993 tgev and prcv can also be genetically differentiated by nested rt-pcr using primers flanking the s gene deletion kim et al 2000 paton et al 1997 phylogenetic analysis revealed a close genetic relationship between the prcv-isu-1 and the four tgev strains indicating that prcv-isu-1 shares a common ancestor with tgev miller and purdue strains nevertheless it remains unclear which strain of tgev is the immediate ancestor of prcv-isu-1 it had been hypothesized that prcv may have evolved from a live vaccine strain of tgev such as the purdue strain used for commercial vaccines in the us however our analysis suggests that prcv-isu-1 may have evolved from a tgev miller-like strain several lines of evidence support this conclusion first our results showed that prcv-isu-1 has a higher genomic sequence identity 98 with miller m6 than with purdue strains and it has a closer relationship to miller strains than to purdue strains including the complete purdue strain genome available in genbank by phylogenetic analysis secondly miller strains have identical or similar deletions in the orf3 gene as prcv-isu-1 the 29 nt deletion from nt 195 to 223 of the orf3 gene of prcv-isu-1 is shared by miller strains but not by purdue strains the 117 nt deletion in orf3b gene nt 407 to 523 of prcv-isu-1 overlaps with the 531 nt deletion in orf3b of miller m60 this deletion is notable because it occurs at the same amino acid in each predicted polypeptide and at equivalent nucleotide coordinates in both m60 and prcv-isu-1 the fact that prcv-isu-1 has the closest relationship with miller strains at both the genomic and protein levels and the orf3 gene of miller strains also have a high frequency of mutations and deletions suggests that a miller-like strain is the ancestor of prcv-isu-1 and m60 may represent an analog of an intermediate species during prcv evolution from a tgev miller-like strain our sequence analysis revealed that genetic divergence most frequently occurs within the s gene and also between the s and m genes of tgev in orf3a3b suggesting that these regions are under the highest selective pressure during tgev evolution mutations and deletions in these regions have been documented in tgev variants that have altered tropisms virulence or phenotype kim et al 2000 kwon et al 1998 page et al 1991 sanchez et al 1992 wesley et al 1990a wesley et al 1990b wesley et al 1991 our sequence analyses of the 4 tgev strains and prcv-isu-1 have identified two common changes in the variable s and orf3 genes the t to g mutation at nt 1753 of the s genes of the attenuated m60 and p115 compared to the virulent counterparts and the deletions in orf3b genes of m60 and prcv-isu-1 starting at a nearly identical position for each these deletions may also be related to common mechanisms of attenuation between these related strains we could not ascertain whether genetic changes at these two positions alone may have altered viral virulence however identification of these two common changes should help to localize sequences determining tgev attenuation as confirmed by using reverse genetics the history of prototypic virulent tgev miller m6 attenuated tgev miller m60 virulent tgev purdue attenuated tgev purdue p115 and prcv-isu-1 was summarized previously simkins et al 1992 briefly m6 and m60 are low and high tissue culture-passaged tgev virulent and attenuated miller strains respectively saif and sestak 2006 the virulent miller m6 was derived from field miller isolate after 6 passages and 2 plaque purification steps in swine testicular st cells in ohio in 1965 bohl eh 1965 saif and sestak 2006 welch and saif 1988 the miller m60 was attenuated after 60 passages and 2 plaque purification steps in st cells saif and sestak 2006 woods 1979 the virulent purdue strain was originally isolated by haelterman in indiana and passed 8 times in pigs with 2 subsequent cloning steps in st cells haelterman 1964 continuous passage 115 times 115x with numerous plaque purifications of the virulent purdue strain led to the attenuated purdue p115 strain bohl et al 1972 the isu-1 strain of prcv originated from a herd isolate by hill in indiana in 1990 it was passaged 8 in st cell culture and plaque purified 2 hill et al 1990 the prototypic viruses were subjected to additional passages in st cells or gnotobiotic pigs before sequencing in our lab an additional 10 4 10 and 11 passages in st cells were applied to miller m6 miller m60 prcv-isu-1 and purdue p115 respectively for virulent tgev purdue 2 more passages were done in gnotobiotic pigs and the cell passaged m6 10 additional passages was also confirmed as virulent for the gnotobiotic pigs

replicates  analysis of codon usage and evolutionary rates of the 2019-ncov genes maddalena dilucca sergio forcelloni athanasia pavlopoulou alexandros georgakilas g andrea giansanti  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 2019-ncov which first broke out in wuhan china in december of 2019 causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality ranging from 3 to 6 to better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-ncov in this paper we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-ncov for this purpose we compare the codon usage of 2019-ncov with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae we found that 2019-ncov shows a rich composition of at nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage which appears to be not optimized to human host then we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins viral replicase spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid characteristic of coronaviruses we found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents moreover we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins matrix and envelope tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes conversely genes encoding nucleocapsid n viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones taken together our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-ncov alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus subdivided in subgroups a b c and d gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus coronaviruses can infect humans and many different animal  the name coronavirus is derived from the greek korwna that mean crown the first complete genome of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus -mhv a positive sense single-stranded rna virus was first reported in 1949 it belongs to the family coronaviridae and ranges from 264 thcov hku12 to 317 sw1 kb in length 10  making it the largest genomes among all known rna viruses with g  c contents varying from 32 to 43 20  the coronavirinae family consists of four genera based on their genetic properties including genus the nucleotide content of 30 coronaviruses coding sequences are calculated the results reveal that the nucleotide a is the most frequent base and the nucleotide frequencies are in order a tgc 19  for ncov we note a different trend tagc but in totally at is more used than gc see table 3  the gc content in ncov is 0373  005 we downloaded the protein-coding sequences of 2019-ncov from gidaid database by classifying each n-cov based on the geographic location where they are sequenced see tree in a2 for each n-cov genome we calculated the relative synonymous codon usage rscu in the form of a 61-component vector in fig  a1 we show the heatmap and the associated clustering of these vectors despite the high mutation rate that characterizes 2019-ncov genome 30  4  the overall codon usage bias among 2019-ncov strains appears to be similar moreover their associated vectors did not cluster according to geographic location thus confirming the common origin of these genomes therefore we will consider a unique vector to represent 2019-ncov in the following analyses figure 1  clustering of the rscu vectors associated to coronavirus analysis of codon bias in coronavirus genomes reveal that the newly identified coronavirus 2019-ncov wuhan-hu-1 sequence was closer to sarsr-cov as in the reconstructed phylogenetic tree shown in figure a3  heatmap are drawn with the cimminer software 25  which uses euclidean distances and the average linkage algorithm we compared the codon usage of 2019-ncov with that of the other coronavirus genomes for this purpose we used the rscu which is a biologically relevant metric of distance between the codon usage in the protein-coding sequences of these genomes in fig 1  we report the heatmap of the rscu values associated with the coronavirus the rscu values of the majority of the codons scored between 0 and 31 see legend in figure 1  interestingly analysis of codon bias in coronavirus genomes reveal that the newly identified coronavirus 2019-ncov wuhan-hu-1 sequence has a clear origin from other beta-covs and is closer specifically to sarsr-cov consistent with their phylogenetic relationships  figure a3  in line with previous observations we show that the mean cpg relative abundance in the coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed 27  specifically ggg ggc ccg pyrimidine-cpg and acg purine-cpg present a very low frequence of occurrence probably due to the relative trna abundance of the host in fact in human the abundance of trna in codons ggg ggc ccg and acg are respectavely 0 0 4 and 7 in 2019-ncov the most frequently used codons are cgu arginine 234 times and ggu glycine 242 whereas the least used codons are ggg glycine and ucg serine we also note the most frequently used codons for each amino acid ended in either u or a 5 24 the codon usage of 2019-ncov is not optimized to the host to measure the codon usage bias in the coronavirus genomes we used the effective number of codons enc value and the competition adaptation index cai in table 2 and 3 we report the enc and cai values for all the coronaviruses we considered in this work to visually enhance the differences among the codon figure 2  z-score values z-score is calculated for two codon bias indexes enc and cai we show in figure that a lot of coronavirus have a codon usage major tha the average value of the family z-score 3  for what concerns 2019-ncov it presents average cai and enc higher than the average too usage of these coronaviruses we calculated zscore of a single virus in relation to the other members of the cov subfamily interestingly the enc value associated to 2019-ncov 519  259 is lower than the average of all coronaviruses meaning that 2019-ncov uses a broader set of synonymous codons in its coding sequences we also note that cai of 2019-ncov 0727  0054 is lower than the average one underscoring that this coronavirus tend to use codons that are not optimized to the host we calculate similarity index sid to measure the effect of codon usage bias of the host human on the 2019-ncov genes the sid values range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating that the host has a dominant effect on the usage codons 16 in our case sid for 2019-ncov is equal to 078 the genome of the newly emerging 2019-ncov consists of a single positive-stranded rna that is approximately 30k nucleotides long the overall genome is organizated similar to other coronaviruses ceraolo et al performed a cross-species analysis for all proteins encoded by the 2019-ncov see figure 3 -4 in 3  the newly sequenced virus genome encodes polyproteins common to all betacoronavirus which are further cleaved into the individual structural proteins e m n and s as well the non-structural rdrp 28  so only five virall genes are classified according to their viral location and studied for each virus because the short length and insufficient codon usage diversity of the other genes might have biased the results the corresponding gene products including s protein regulates virus attachment to the receptor of the target host cell 2  the e protein functions to assemble the virions and acts as an ion channel 18  the m protein plays a role in virus assembly and is involved in biosynthesis of new virus particles 17 the n protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the virus rna 19  finally rdrp catalyzes viral rna syntesis we calculate for these five proteins the rscu vectors in each virus of the dataset see figure 3  we show that only for gene e  to further investigate which factors account for the low codon usage bias of the different genes in coronavirus we analyzed the relationship between the enc value and the percentage of g or c in the third positioncodons gc3s in figure 4  we show separately the enc-plots obtained for the five genes m n s e and rdrp together with the wrights theoretical curve corresponding to the case when the codon usage is only determined by the gc3s 29  we would like to point out that if mutational bias as quantified by gc-content in the generally neutral 3rd codon position is the main factor in determining the codon usage among these genes the corresponding point in the enc-plot should lie on or just below wrights curve in figure 4  all distributions lie below the theoretical curve an indication that not only mutational bias but also natural selection plays a non-negligible role in the codon choice in all genes this is exemplified by the violinplots in figure 5 of the distances between the genes and wrights theoretical curve genes n s and rdrp are more scattered below the theoretical curve than those of genes m and e implying that in the latter the codon usage patterns are pretty consistent with the effects of mutational bias interestingly data points corresponding to the gene n which is the major viral structural component needed to protect and encapsidate the viral rna is localized around gc305 see figure 4  this means that the displacement under the curve most likely reflects the selective pressure exerted on this gene conservely all other genes show a displacement towards lower values of gc3-content thus corroborating our previously mentioned observation that coronaviruses tend to use codons that end with a and u see section 23 a neutrality plot analysis was performed to estimate the role of mutational bias and natural selection in shaping the codon usage patterns of the five genes under investigation in this plot the average gc-content in the first and second positions of codons gc12 is plotted against gc3s which is considered as a pure mutational parameter in figure 5  we report the neutrality plots obtained for genes m n s e rdrp together with the best-fit lines and the slopes associated with them the rationale to understand the results is that the wider is the deviation between the slope of the regression line and the bisector the stronger is the action of selective pressure all correlation are highly significant spearman correlation -r 2 analysis p-value00001 by comparing the divergences between the regression lines and the bisectors in each panel we reveal that the five genes here considered are subject to different balance between natural selection and mutational bias specifically in line with the enc-plot analyses the genes s and rdrp present the largest deviations of their regression lines from the bisector lines and therefore a stronger action of natural selection conversely the regression line for the gene m is closer to the bisector than the other genes meaning that the this gene is the least one subject to the action of natural selection finally the genes e and n are intermediate between the previous cases it is worth noting that almost all data points are located below the bisector lines implying a selective tendency for a higher at content in the first two codon positions than in the third one in addition both gc3 and gc12 are lower than  we analyze the rate of evolution that characterize these genes by confronting the nucleotide sequences of the newly emerging 2019-ncov and their corrisponding protein sequences with those of other coronaviruses here considered each gene of 2019-ncov was compared to the orthologous gene in one of the 30 coronaviruses to estimate evolutionary divergences each pair of homologous genes is represented by a point in the forsdyke plot 8  which correlates protein divergence with dna divergence each point in forsdyke plots measures the divergence between pairs of orthologous genes in the two species as projected along with the phenotypic protein and nucleotidic dna axis thus the slope is an estimation of the fraction of dna mutations that result in amino acid substitutions in the speciation process between two species 8  in figure 7  we show separately for each gene the associated forsdyke plot overall protein and dna sequence divergences are linearly correlated and these correlations can be expressed through slopes and intercepts of the regression lines overall protein and dna sequence divergences are linearly correlated and these correlations can be expressed through slopes and intercepts of the regression lines genes m and e show quite low slopes indicating that these proteins tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes conversely the steeper slopes for genes n rdrp and s indicate that these genes tend to evolve faster compared to other ones a plausible explanation for this observation is that protein n due to its immunogenicity has been frequently used to generate specific antibodies against various animal coronavirus including in sars 24  the viral replicase polyprotein that is essential for the replication of viral rna and finally the gene s encodes the protein that is responsible for the spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses taken together our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these proteins could represent a major obstacle to in the development of a antiviral therapeutics against 2019-ncov to investigate the factors leading to the 2019-ncov and other viruses related to codon usage patterns several analytical methods were used in our study first the rscu value of the 2019-ncov was calculated despite the high mutation rate that characterize 2019-ncov we do not show differences in codon usage between these genomesmoreover their associated vectors did not cluster for geographically positon thus confirming the common origin of these genomes the nucleotide composition confirm higher at content and low gc content as it is common in rna viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars   the results indicate also that codon usage bias exists and that the 2019-ncov preferred codons almost all end in u the codon usage bias was further confirmed by the mean enc value of 519 a value greater than 45 is considered as a slight codon usage bias due to mutation pressure or nucleotide compositional constraints the same analysis is effectuated with cai index that it is calculated on the with rna gene is the least one subject to the action of natural selection finally the genes e and n are intermidiate between the previous cases to analyze the rate of evolution that characterize these genes by confronting the nucleotide sequences we use the forsdyke plot thar correlates protein divergence with dna divergence the two proteins m and e show quite low slopes indicating that these proteins tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes conversely the steeper slopes for gene n and rdrp and the gene s encoding for the s protein which is responsible for the spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses indicate that these three genes and therefore their corresponding protein products tend to evolve faster compared to the other two genes findings of the present study could be directed to be useful for developing diagnostic reagents and probes for detecting a range of viruses and isolates in one test and for vaccine development using the information about codon usage patterns in these genes the complete coding genomic sequences of 306 isolates of ncov reported across the world to date were obtained from gisaid available at https  wwwgisaidorgepif lu  applicationsnext  hcov  19  app and ncbi viruses database accessed as on 17 march 2020 then the sequences are selected according to their geographical distribution the isolation date and the host species the complete coding genomic sequences of 30 coronaviruses were downloaded from the national center for biotechnological information ncbi available at https  wwwncbinlmnihgov for each virus we consider in following alphabetical order genes e m n rdrp and s the diverse nucleotide compositional properties are calculated for the coding sequences of 30 cov genomes these compositional properties comprise the frequencies of occurrence of each nucleotide a t g and c au and gc contents nucleotides g  c at the first gc1 second gc2 and third codon positions gc3 to calculate these values we use an in-house python script we calculate also mean frequencies of nucleotides g  c at the first and the second positions gc12 rscu vectors for all the genomes were computed by using an in-house python script following the formula in the rscui xi is the number of occurrences in a given genome of codon i and the sum in the denominator runs over its ni synonymous codons if the rscu value for a codon i is equal to 1 this codon was chosen equally and randomly codons with rscu values greater than 1 have positive codon usage bias while those with value less than 1 have relatively negative codon usage bias   rscu heat maps were drawn with the cimminer software 25  which uses euclidean distances and the average linkage algorithm en c is an estimate of the frequency of different codons used in a coding sequence in general en c ranges from 20 when each aminoacid is coded by just one and the same codon to 61 when all synonymous codons are used on an equal footing given a sequence of interest the computation of en c starts from f a quantity defined for each family  of synonymous codons one for each amino acid where m is the number of different codons in  each one appearing n1   n2    nm  times in the sequence and n  m k1 n k  en c then weights these quantities on a sequence where ns is the number of families with one codon only and km is the number of families with degeneracy m the set of 6 synonymous codons for leu can be split into one family with degeneracy 2 similar to that of p he and one family with degeneracy 4 similar to that eg of p ro we have evaluated en c by using the implementation in dam be 50 31  codon adaptation index cai  is used to quantify the codon usage similarities between the virus and host coding sequences the principle behind cai is that codon usage in highly expressed genes can reveal the optimal ie most efficient for translation codons for each amino acid hence cai is calculated based on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess for each codon i the relative synonymous codon usages rscui and the relative codon adaptiveness wi in the rscui xi is the number of occurrences of codon i in the genome and the sum in the denominator runs over the ni synonyms of i rscu s thus measure codon usage bias within a family of synonymous codons wi is then defined as the usage frequency of codon i compared to that of the optimal codon for the same amino acid encoded by i-ie the one which is mostly used in a reference set of highly expressed genes the cai for a given gene g is calculated as the geometric mean of the usage frequencies of codons in that gene normalized to the maximum cai value possible for a gene with the same amino acid composition where the product runs over the lg codons belonging to that gene except the stop codon this index values range from 0 to 1 where the score 1 represents the tendency of a gene to always use the most frequently used synonymous codons in the host the cai analysis of these coding sequences are performed using dam be 50 31  the synonymous codon usage data of different hostes human-homo sapiens and other species are retrieved from the codon usage database available at httpwwwkazusaorjpcodon to study the patterns of codon bias in the coronaviruses we use z-score values where en c f amily is the average of the ratio within a codon bias index in a family of a virus v en c v and v are the average value of en c and its standard deviation over the whole virus v and nv is the number of virus in the family we use the standard deviation of the mean

nucleocapsid protein n the enc-plot is a plot in which the enc is the ordinate and the gc3 is the abscissa depending on the action of mutational bias and natural selection different cases are discernable if a gene is not subject to selection a clear relationship is expected between enc and gc3  where s represents the value of gc3  genes for which the codon choice is only constrained by mutational bias are expected to lie on or just below the wrights theoretical curve alternatively if a particular gene is subject to selection it will fall below wrights theoretical curve in this case the vertical distance between the point and the theoretical curve provides an estimation of the relative extent to which natural selection and mutational bias affect cub to evaluate scatter of dots from theoretical wrights curve we calculate the module of distance and we drawn box plot calculated with an in-house python script we used a neutrality plot analysis  to estimate the relative

separately performed a spearman correlation analysis between gc1 and gc2 with the gc3 if the correlation between gc12 and gc3 is statistically significant the slope of the regression line provides a measure of the relative extent to which natural selection and mutational bias affect cub of these genes sueoka 1999  in particular if the mutational bias is the driving force that shapes cub then the corresponding data points should be distributed along the bisector slope of unity on the other hand if natural selection also affects the codon choice of a family of genes then the corresponding regression line should diverge from the bisector thus the extent of the divergence between the regression line and the bisector indicates that the extent of codon choice due to the natural selection to study the evolutionary rates of genes m n s rdrp and e we performed an analysis by using our previously defined forsdyke plot 8  each gene in 2019-ncov taken as a reference was confronted with the homologous gene in one of the 30 coronaviruses considered in this analysis each pair of homologous genes is represented by a point in the forsdyke plot which correlates protein divergence with dna divergence see methods in 8 for details the protein sequences were aligned using biopython the dna sequences were then aligned using the protein alignments as templates then dna divergences and protein divergences were assessed as axplained in methods in 8 by counting the number of mismatches in each pair of aligned sequences thus each point in forsdyke plots measures the divergence between pairs of homologous genes in the two species as projected along with the phenotypic protein and nucleotidic dna axisthe first step in each comparison is to compute the regression line between protein vs dna sequence divergence in the forsdyke plot getting values of intercept and slope for each variant of gene to test whether the regression parameters associated with each variant are different or not we have followed a protocol founded by f-statistic test considering a p-value  005 to explore the evolutionary relationships among the four genera of coronaviruses phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genomic sequences of the 30 covs listed in table 1 was performed the sequences were aligned with the usage of clustalo 21  22  the resulting multiple sequence alignment was used to build a

rna-binding in the n-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid protein are essential determinants for the infectivity of coronavirus in cultured cells yong tan wah shouguo fang hui fan julien lescar dx liu   rna viruses including coronaviruses encode a group of structural phosphoproteins with basic patches on their surface as a pivotal structural component of the virion this group of proteins plays essential roles in packaging the rna genome to form a ribonucleoprotein rnp complex resulting from assembly of the viral rna and multiple copies of the nucleocapsid protein a detailed dissection and characterization of the intrinsic rna-binding properties of these proteins are thus essential for understanding several important processes in the life cycle of rna viruses including assembly of the nucleocapsid the specific encapsidation of viral rna and morphogenesis of virions in this study amino acid residues in the n-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid n protein of a coronavirus that are critical for its rna-binding activity are identified and their roles in viral infectivity are analyzed using site-directed mutagenesis based on our previous structural studies coronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing the largest known single-stranded positive-sense rna genome of 30 kb 1 during the coronavirus life cycle the n protein is synthesized in large amounts and is thought to play an important role by specifically packaging the viral genome into a filamentous nucleocapsid of 10 to 15 nm in diameter and several 100 nm in length a macromolecular structure that is visible by using electron microscopy 2 in addition to its structural role the n protein also participates in viral rna transcription replication and in modulating the metabolism of host cells 313 using x-ray crystallography techniques we recently determined a 3d structure of the n protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv a prototype coronavirus and showed that the basic building block for nucleocapsid assembly was a dimer of the n protein 14 the 409 amino acids long ibv n protein is composed of two globular domains that are resistant to proteolysis amino acids 29 to 160 form the n-terminal rna binding domain and residues 218 to 329 form its c-terminal dimerization domain 514 even though the structure of the n-terminal domain was determined in the absence of a nucleic acid ligand its overall shape and the distribution of electrostatic charges suggest a plausible model for rna binding the outer surface of the n-terminal domain is enriched in aromatic and basic residues a common feature for rna-binding proteins 15 the shape of this domain is reminiscent of a hand having basic fingers a hydrophobic palm and an acidic wrist the positively charged fingers-like -hairpin extension could neutralize the phosphate groups emanating from rna whilst the base moieties could make contact with exposed aromatic residues from the hydrophobic palm 14 based on this structural hypothesis we chose to mutate a number of evolutionarily conserved residues in the n-terminal domain of the ibv n protein in order to assess their roles in viral genomic rna binding and in viral replication we used purified recombinant wild type and mutant proteins containing the n-terminal domain expressed in escherichia coli for rna binding assays these studies led to the identification of a number of amino acid residues essential for the rna-binding activity of the domain subsequently we introduced mutations that either severely or mildly impair the rna binding activities of the n-terminal domain into an infectious cdna clone system derived from the genomic rna of ibv to assess their effects on viral replication and infectivity we identified several residues exposed to the solvent whose substitutions to alanine yield a decrease of rna binding and a concomitant reduction in virus replication interestingly residues arg-76 and tyr-94 located at the base of the positively charged flexible hairpin loop and on the hydrophobic platform respectively were critical for rna binding and viral infectivity his-tagged wild type and mutant n-terminal domains of ibv n protein were expressed in ecoli bl-21 by induction with 1 mm isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside iptg cells were lysed by sonication and purified by metal affinity chromatography with protino-ni 150 kit macherey

at 4c overnight the two reaction mixtures were then mixed and further ligated at 4c overnight the final ligation products were extracted with phenolchloroformisoamyl alcohol 25241 precipitated with ethanol and detected by electrophoresis on 04 agarose gels full-length transcripts were generated in vitro using the mmessage mmachine t7 kit ambion austin tx the n transcripts were generated by using a linearized pkt0-ibvn containing ibv n gene and the 3-untranslated region 3-utr as templates the in vitro synthesized full-length and n transcripts were treated with dnase i and purified with phenolchloroform vero cells were grown to 90 confluence trypsinized washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline pbs and resuspended in pbs rna transcripts were added to 400 l of vero cell suspension in an electroporation cuvette and electroporated with one pulse at 450 v 50 f with a bio-rad gene pulser ii electroporator the transfected vero cells were cultured overnight in 1

kit stratagene and confirmed by sequencing of the whole fragments confluent monolayers of vero cells on 6-well plates were infected with wild-type and mutant viruses at a multiplicity of 1 pfucell after 1 h of incubation at 37c cells were washed twice with pbs and cultured in 3 ml of mem containing 05 carboxymethy cellulose for 3 days the cells were fixed and stained with 01 toluidine vero cells were infected with wild-type and recombinant ibv and harvested at different times post-infection viral stocks were prepared by freezingthawing of the cells three times the plaque-forming units

buffer for 1 h at room temperature after washing three times with pbst the polypeptides were detected with a chemiluminescence detection kit ecl amersham biosciences according to the manufacturers instructions pcr products covering the ibv sequence from 25 95726 352 nt were amplified by using the forward primer 5-cgggcatatgtcttctggaaatgcatcttgg-3 and the reverse primer 5-cgggatccttacaggggaatgaagtcccaac-3 the pcr fragments were digested with ndei and bamhi and ligated into ndei- and bamhi-digested pet-16b novagen each mutation was introduced by two-round pcr and the mutation introduced was confirmed by automated nucleotide sequencing the n-terminal rna-binding domain of n protein from both ibv and sars-cov contains a flexible and positively charged hairpin loop that extends much beyond the protein core and that could grasp a nucleic acid substrate by neutralizing its phosphate groups figure 1 1418 positively charged lysine and arginine residues in the n-terminal domain of sars-cov n protein were proposed to bind a 32 nt stemloop structure located at the 3 end of the sars-cov rna genome 18 indeed the structure of this domain possesses some features reminiscent of rna-binding proteins sharing the rnp fold 1922 these rna-binding proteins including the u1a spliceosomal protein 23 and the coat protein from ms2 bacteriophage 24 bind the rna ligand with residues emanating from the surface of a four-stranded anti-parallel  sheet presumably strands 2 and 3 as well as the flexible -hairpin from the ibv nucleocapsid protein could fulfill a similar role by interacting with phosphate groups from an rna ligand figure 1 the 3 strand is the longest in the n-terminal domain of ibv n protein and several evolutionarily conserved residues project from it figure 1 nucleotide bases in single-stranded rna have a tendency to stack either on adjacent bases or with aromatic side chains of the protein 20 the above structural model was partially supported by the demonstration that the n-terminal domain of ibv n protein could interact with rna fragments corresponding to the 3 end of the viral genome 14 to more vigorously test this model systematic mutagenesis of residues essential for the rna-binding activity was carried out we targeted the exposed hydrophobic residues tyr-92 and tyr-94 strand 3 that could form stacking interactions with the nucleotide bases as well as several basic or polar residues emanating from the -hairpin figure 2a as summarized in figure 2a 10 amino acids were mutated to alanine these residues are either exposed to the solvent gln-74 arg-76 lys-78 lys-81 tyr-92 and tyr-94 or have been conserved during evolution tyr-70 and arg-73 and are thus likely to be involved in rna binding or to play an undefined functional role in addition mutation of asp-111 to an alanine was included as an additional control for the rna-binding assay figure 2a the wild type and mutant constructs spanning 29 to 160 amino acids with a hexa-histidine tag at their n-termini were cloned into a bacterial expression vector expressed in ecoli and purified to near homogeneity approximately equal amounts of the purified proteins were separated on sdspage figure 2b upper panels after transfer to a hybond c extra membrane the rna-binding activities of wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed by northwestern blot with two probes corresponding to the positive- and negative-sense 3-utr of ibv respectively a moderate decrease in binding to both the positive and negative sense rna probes was consistently observed with most mutant proteins and representative gels are shown in figure 2b figure 2b middle and lower panels among all mutants mutation of tyr-94 to an alanine residue showed the most significant reduction in binding of the domain to both positive and negative probes the rna binding activities of this mutant to positive and negative probes were reduced to 27 and 25 respectively of the wild type were observed figure 2b lane 9 relatively less reduction in the rna-binding activity was observed for the r76a k78a k81a and y92a mutant proteins which retain between 5074 of the wild-type binding activity figure 2b lanes 58 with the exception of the q74a and d111a mutants which displayed a slight increase in the rna binding activity to both the positive- and negative-sense rnas figure 2b lanes 4 and 10 all other mutants showed a certain degree of reduction in their binding activity to either rna probes figure 2b as a control a circular dichroism analysis of the two corresponding r76a and y94a single mutants was performed to check whether the mutant proteins were properly folded the spectra obtained for these two mutants were similar to the wild-type protein ruling out any drastic conformational change introduced by the mutations data not shown as none of the single mutations introduced could totally abrogate the rna-binding activity of the ibv n-terminal domain two mutant constructs carrying double mutations were made as can be seen in figure 2b lanes 13 and 14 mutations of both arg-73 and lys-78 to alanine residues r73k78a reduced the rna-binding activities to the positive- and negative-sense rna probes between 44 and 10 of wild-type respectively mutations of both arg-76 and tyr-94 r76y94a to alanine reduced the rna-binding to the positive- and negative-sense rna probes to only 7 and 19 of wild-type respectively figure 2b lanes 15 and 16 taken together these results are consistent with the presence of an extended rna binding site covering a large part of the accessible surface of the n-terminal domain of the coronavirus n protein they are also in agreement with the assumption that removal of a single positive charge at the protein surface by mutation of a lysine or arginine residue to an alanine is insufficient to totally disrupt the formation of the proteinrna complex the r76a and y94a mutations were first introduced into an infectious clone of ibv and in vitro transcribed full-length rna molecules derived from wild type and mutant constructs were generated by in vitro transcription using the t7 rna polymerase in the presence of a cap analog electroporation of wild-type rna transcripts together with an rna fragment covering the n protein region into vero cells showed the formation of massive cpe at 2 days post-electroporation figure 3 panel ribvn in contrast no cpe formation was observed in cells transfected with transcripts derived from either mutant up to 5 days post-electroporation suggesting that no infectious virus could be rescued from the two mutant transcripts figure 3 panels r76an and y94an these results indicate that r76a and y94a mutations which severely reduce the rna-binding activity of the n-terminal domain of the n protein may abolish the infectivity of the in vitro synthesized full-length ibv transcripts introduction of q74a and y92a mutations into the full-length infectious clone of ibv was then carried out typical cpes were observed in cells transfected with q74a mutant transcripts at 3 days post-electroporation and recombinant viruses were recovered figure 3 panel q74a in cells electroporated with y92a transcripts a typical cpe was observed at 2 days post-electroporation figure 3 panel y92a1 incubation of the transfected cells for one more day saw the appearance of more cpes figure 3 panel y92a2 however prolonged incubation of the transfected cells up to 6 days saw no spread of the infection from the two initiated infected loci to neighboring cells re-infection of fresh vero cells with either medium collected from these cells or total cell lysates prepared by freezing and thawing of the transfected cells showed no detection of the cpe formation indicating that the minute amount of viruses rescued from the initially transfected cells could not maintain infectivity in subsequent passage the r76a and y94a mutant n constructs were then used to test if they could facilitate the rescue of the in vitro synthesized full-length ibv transcripts in trans as mentioned efficient recovery of infectious virus from the in vitro transcribed full-length ibv rna requires co-transfection of these in vitro transcripts together with the in vitro synthesized rna covering the n gene electroporation of wild-type full-length ibv transcripts together with rnas synthesized in vitro from wild-type and the two mutant n constructs respectively showed efficient recovery of the infectious virus with cpe observed on almost the whole monolayer at 3 days post-electroporation figure 3 panels ribvn-r76a and ribvn-y94a in contrast cells transfected with the full-length ibv transcripts only without co-electroporation with the n transcripts showed the formation of a single cpe on the whole monolayer at 3 days post-electroporation figure 3 panel ribv-n as no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with r76a and y94a mutant transcripts total rna was extracted from cells electroporated with wild-type and mutant full-length transcripts and rtpcr amplification of subgenomic mrnas was carried out to check whether a low level of rna replication and subgenomic mrna transcription occurred in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts the forward primer used in this reaction corresponds to the leader sequence from 2646 nt in the genomic rna and the downstream primers covers ibv sequences from 24 784 to 24 803 nt if transcription of subgenomic mrnas did occur a 415 bp pcr product corresponding to the 5-terminal region of the subgenomic mrna4 and a 1010 bp fragment corresponding to the 5-terminal region of the subgenomic mrna3 would be expected as shown in figure 4a a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild-type full-length transcripts at 2 days post-electroporation lane 2 sequencing of the pcr fragments confirmed that they represent the correct sequences of the corresponding regions of the subgenomic mrnas 3 and 4 respectively the same pcr products were not detected in cells electroporated with the r76a and y94a mutant transcripts respectively at 24 48 and 72 h post-electroporation figure 4a lanes 38 in cells electroporated with q74a mutants at 3 days post-electroporation rtpcr amplification of the subgenomic mrna 3 and 4 showed the detection of the 415 and 1010 bp bands figure 4a lane 9 the same pcr products were not evident in cells electroporated with the y92a mutant transcripts figure 4a lane 10
 rtpcr amplification of the negative strand rna was performed to check if rna replication occurred in these transfected cells the primer pair was chosen so that the ibv sequence from 14 931 to 15 600 nt would be amplified by the rtpcr if replication of viral rna occurred a 670 bp pcr fragment would be expected as shown in figure 4b rtpcr fragments amplified from both positive lanes 4 7 and 9 and negative lanes 3 6 and 10 strand rna templates were obtained from cells transfected with the mutant transcripts the amount of the negative strand rna was approximately half of that of the positive strand rna figure 4b as positive control the same rtpcr fragment for the negative strand rna was observed in cells transfected with wild-type transcripts figure 4b lanes 8 and 11 in the negative controls total rna extracted from cells transfected with y94a figure 4b lane 2 and r76a figure 4b lane 5 was analyzed by pcr directly using the primer set for the negative strand rna no corresponding pcr fragment was detected from these samples demonstrating that the detection of the negative strand rna in cells transfected with wild-type and mutant constructs by rtpcr is due to the replication of viral rna these results confirm that transcription of the negative strand rna has taken place in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts the transcription of negative strand rna in cells electroporated with wild-type r76a y92a and y94a transcripts was then quantitatively determined and compared by real time rtpcr at 24 and 48 h post-electroporation respectively compared to cells transfected with wild-type transcripts the relative amounts of negative strand rna in cells transfected with r76a y92a and y94a were 48 46 and 50 respectively at 24 h post-electroporation figure 4c lanes 14 these figures were dropped to 41 45 and 23 respectively at 48 h post-electroporation figure 4c lanes 56 taken together these results demonstrate that transcription of the negative strand rna has taken place in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts as the level of negative strand rna was not increased in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts over a time-course experiment it suggests that transcription of these rna species may occur only in the initially transfected cells using the in vitro transcripts as templates the growth properties of the q74a mutant virus on vero cells were tested by analysis of plaque sizes and growth curves of passage 3 mutant virus compared to cells infected with wild-type recombinant virus ribv slightly smaller sized plaques were observed in cells infected with the q74a mutant virus figure 5a analysis of the growth curves of wild-type and the mutant virus demonstrated that the mutant virus grew slightly more slowly than the wild type recombinant virus when 10-fold more mutant virus was used 2- to 10-fold more mutant virus was produced at 824 h post-infection figure 5a the titers of the mutant virus dropped more rapidly than wild-type virus at 36 and 48 h post-infection figure 5a
 further characterization of the mutant virus was subsequently carried out by analysis of the genomic and subgenomic rna and the expression of viral structural proteins s and n northern blot analysis of cells infected with the 5th passage of ribv and q74a mutant viruses showed that similar amounts of genomic and subgenomic rnas were detected figure 5b quantitative comparison of the subgenomic rna synthesis by densitometry analysis of the bands shown in figure 5b demonstrated that in cells infected with q74a mutant virus p5 the relative amounts of mrna 2 3 4 5 and 6 are 98 101 121 104 106 and 101 respectively of those in cells infected with ribv however western blot analysis of cells infected with ribv and q74a mutant virus showed that more s and n proteins were detected in cells infected with wild-type virus figure 5c lanes 114 to confirm if the q74a mutation is genetically stable during passage of the mutant virus in cells viral rna was isolated from cells infected with passage 2 and 5 virus and amplified by rtpcr sequencing analysis showed that the two mutated nucleotides ca-gc remained stable figure 5d furthermore no compensatory mutation was found in other region of the n protein confirming that q74a mutant virus is stable in cell culture system the intrinsic rna-binding activity of the nucleocapsid protein of rna viruses is essential for packaging the rna genome into a rnp complex in previous structural studies of the n protein from two coronaviruses the n-terminal domain was shown to be resistant to proteolysis and to fold independently 1415 it serves as a functional unit critical for the rna-binding activity of the protein 14 based on these structural results the importance of individual residues in rna-binding was studied here we showed that tyr-94 in strand 3 binds to the rna ligand the positively charged arg-76 is located in the immediate vicinity of this aromatic residue at the base of the extended flexible hairpin loop within a cluster of positively charged residues thus the interaction between arg-76 and tyr-94 with rna appears to play a crucial role during virus assembly since no single mutation could totally disrupt nucleic acid binding other aromatic or basic residues located close to these two residues at the surface of the n-terminal domain are likely to contribute to rna binding by creating a broad surface that makes contact with the genomic rna using a simple docking experiment the rna binding site seems capable of accommodating up to 89 nt bases per n-terminal domain monomer the arg-76 and tyr-94 residues identified in this paper thus provide more precise mapping of the location of the rna-binding site on the ibv n protein it is interesting to note that the main effect of these mutations on viral life cycles was on subgenomic rna transcription however the replication of negative strand rna is nearly normal in cells transfected with these mutant constructs is it possible that these mutations will directly impair an undefined function of the n protein that is essential for subgenomic rna transcription two possibilities were considered first the coronavirus n protein is directly involved in subgenomic rna replication the mhv n protein was shown to be involved in coronaviral rna transcription 4 but the underlying mechanism was unrevealed alternatively the observed phenotypic changes in subgenomic rna replication caused by these mutations may be due to a generally reduced viral replication rate and infectivity in fact several other mutations that affect viral replication cycles were found to have defects in subgenomic rna transcription 2527 in this study we have repeatedly observed that detection of subgenomic rna replication in cells infected with low multiplicity of infectivity of ibv by rtpcr is technically challenging positive results can be obtained only if transcription of subgenomic rna reaches a certainly high level when in vitro transcripts containing y92a mutation were introduced into cells one or two cpes were always observable in a monolayer suggesting the presence of low level viral rna replication however detection of subgenomic rna was consistently unsuccessful in cells electroporated with this mutant transcript coronavirus n protein is a multi-functional protein the protein was shown to be able to facilitate rescue of infectious virus from several coronaviruses by co-electroporation of the in vitro synthesized n transcripts with the in vitro synthesized full-length transcripts 172830 the mechanism for this trans-effect is currently unknown in this study the r76a and y94a mutant n constructs could promote rescue of the infectivity of the in vitro synthesized ibv rna as efficiently as did the wild type n transcripts suggesting that the reduced rna-binding activity in the n-terminal domain does not affect this function of the n protein it also suggests that rna-binding per se is not a major factor that contributes to this important function of the n protein are the reduced replication rate and loss of the infectivity of the mutant transcripts caused by the effects of these mutations on the functionality of the n protein or on the integrity of the genomic rna itself the nice correlation between the reduced rna-binding activity of the n-terminal domain from the mutant proteins and the loss of infectivity of the corresponding mutant transcripts would support that the failure to rescue the viral infectivity is due to the specific mutation that impairs the functionality of the n protein in addition in the cases of q74a and r76a mutants the two mutations are physically adjacent in the genome but yet totally different phenotypes were observed from the two mutants it would support that the failure to recover infectious viruses from the mutant transcripts is due to the fact that these mutations reduceimpair the rna-binding activity of the n protein if this were the case however supplement of wild type n protein in trans would rescue the infectivity of the mutant transcripts two experiments were conducted to test this possibility but none of them were successful first co-transfection of the mutant full-length transcripts with wild-type n transcripts into cells failed to recover infectious virus from the mutant transcripts suggesting that wild-type n rna cannot rescue the infectivity of the mutant transcripts in trans the second experiment was to introduce the mutant full-length transcripts into cells stably expressing a six-his-tagged ibv n protein once again it failed to rescue the infectivity of the mutant transcripts at present it is unclear if this was due to the low-level expression of n protein in these cells or because the n protein expressed in these cells contains the six-his tag at its c-terminus residues arg-76 and tyr-94 in the ibv n protein are well conserved across the whole family of coronaviruses structurally these two residues may correspond to the arg-94 and tyr-112 residues in the sars-cov n protein see figure 1a it is possible that introduction of similar alanine mutations into the sars-cov genome may yield a similar phenotype observed here for ibv the fact that substitutions of gln-74 arg-76 tyr-72 and tyr-94 in the ibv genome by using an infectious clone of ibv showed nice correlation between the rna-binding activity and viral infectivity would suggest potential strategies for intervention of viral replication a compound which could specifically bind to this region of the n protein might interfere with rna binding and thus inhibit virus replication in addition this study points to a number of residues on the surface of the n protein that contribute less to the rna-binding activity and viral infectivity for the design of attenuated coronavirus strains as potential vaccine candidates  insights on early mutational events in sars-cov-2   the covid-19 pandemic caused by a novel 2019 sars coronavirus known as sars-cov-2

identity lu et al 2020  due to this association with bat 55 coronaviruses it was also argued that sars-cov-2 virus has the potential to spread into another 56 species as bat coronaviruses do hu et al 2018  recently it was demonstrated that sars-cov-57 2 is closely related to a pangolin coronavirus pangolin-cov found in dead malayan pangolins 58 with a 9102 identity the closest relationship found so far for sars-cov-2 zhang et al 59 2020 in that study genomic analyses revealed that the s1 protein of pangolin-cov is related 60 closer to sars-cov-2 than to ratg13 coronavirus also five key amino acid residues involved 61 in the interaction with the human ace2 receptor are maintained in pangolin-cov and sars-62 cov-2 but not in ratg13 coronavirus thus it is likely that pangolin species are a natural 63 reservoir of sars-cov-2-like coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 will continue to evolve with 64 novel mutations as the pandemic evolves australian sars-cov-2 mutations which were found to be heterogeneous a mutational signature from usa mutations was however found in an australian sample suggesting a world-80 wide spread of this molecular signature consisting of five-point mutations remarkably 81 mutations in the helicase and orf1a proteins of the virus were found more frequently than others 82 suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve throughout natural selection as proof of the 83 latter a single nucleotide polymorphism snp in an australian sample causes a bona-fide stop 84 codon in the helicase protein strongly suggest this protein will evolve on sars-cov-2 in the 85 future as genetic drift prompts the mutational spectrum of the virus we recommend frequently since sars-cov-2 is an rna virus that rapidly evolves after infection these evolutionary 241 events will likely affect its fitness over time in this study we reveal the early mutational events   receptor recognition and cross-species infections of sars coronavirus fang li   the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic broke out in 20022003 in southern china and spread to other regions of asia and also to europe and north america lee et al 2003 yu et al 2004 it caused more than 8000 infections worldwide with an approximately 10 fatality rate along with huge economic losses sars patients developed flu-like symptoms often followed by acute atypical pneumonia and respiratory failure the epidemic was eventually controlled by conventional public health measures sars briefly re-emerged in 20032004 causing 4 sporadic infections but no fatality or human-to-human transmission liang et al 2004 song et al 2005 since then there have been no reported cases of naturally occurring sars because of the dramatic fashion how it emerged and disappeared sars presents a unique and puzzling case in the history of human epidemics a novel coronavirus sars coronavirus sars-cov was the etiological agent of sars ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 coronaviruses are a family of common ancient and diverse viruses that infect many mammalian and avian species perlman and netland 2009 coronavirus virions contain an envelope a helical capsid and a single-stranded and positive-sense rna genome with a length of 2732 kb their genomes are the largest among all rna viruses they were named coronavirus because of the large spike protein molecules on the virus surface that give the virions a crown-like shape corona in latin means crown fig 1
a b coronaviruses can be classified into at least three major genera   and  gonzaalez et al 2003 six coronaviruses are currently known to infect humans the first five are nl63 and 229e from -genus and oc43 hku1 and sars-cov from -genus perlman and netland 2009 a new member of -genus the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has recently emerged from the middle east and infected at least 88 people with a mortality rate of more than 50 de groot et al 2013 holmes and dominguez 2013 zaki et al 2012 in the past coronaviruses were considered to be mild human viral pathogens that only cause self-resolving respiratory diseases in humans the emergence of sars-cov and mers-cov has changed this conception sars-cov infects a wide variety of animal species including humans palm civets monkeys domestic cats ferrets hamsters raccoon dogs and bats li et al 2006c fig 2
a it is believed that bats harbor the precursors of sars-cov and thus are the natural reservoir for the virus lau et al 2005 li et al 2005b in addition palm civets played a key role in the spread of sars-cov to humans and thus were the interim reservoir or amplifying host for the virus gonzaalez et al 2003 li et al 2005b li et al 2006c shi and hu 2008 not all animals can be efficiently infected by sars-cov for example rats are resistant to sars-cov infections while mice can be infected by sars-cov only inefficiently li et al 2004 subbarao et al 2004 on the other hand various strains of sars-cov have been isolated from different hosts at different times fig 2b these sars-cov strains include htor02 human strain isolated during the 20022003 sars outbreak marra et al 2003 csz02 civet strain isolated from marketplace palm civets during the 20022003 sars outbreak guan et al 2003 hcgd03 human and civet strain isolated during the 20032004 sporadic sars infections song et al 2005 and cgd05 civet strain isolated from wild civets in 2005 liu et al 2007 hhae08 human strain after adaptation to cultured human cells sheahan et al 2008b and bhku05 bat strain isolated in 2005 lau et al 2005 the large number of hosts and identification of the viral strains from different hosts make sars-cov an excellent model system for understanding host ranges and cross-species infections of emerging animal viruses the envelope-anchored trimeric spike protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells by binding to its host receptor and subsequently fusing host and viral membranes bosch et al 2003 gallagher and buchmeier 2001 the spike protein consists of three segments an ectodomain a single-pass membrane anchor and a short intracellular tail fig 1a the ectodomain can be divided into a receptor-binding s1 subunit and a membrane-fusion s2 subunit s1 contains two independent domains an n-terminal domain ntd and a c-domain li 2012 depending on the virus either ntd or c-domain occasionally both binds to a host receptor and functions as a receptor-binding domain rbd breslin et al 2003 godet et al 1994 krempl et al 1997 kubo et al 1994 lin et al 2008 coronaviruses recognize a variety of cell-surface molecules as their host receptors including proteins sugars and heparan sulfate perlman and netland 2009 how they evolved to do so has been revealed by structural studies of coronavirus rbdreceptor interactions chen and li 2013 chen et al 2012 li 2012 li et al 2005aa peng et al 2011 peng et al 2012 reguera et al 2012 wu et al 2011 wu et al 2009 the s1 c-domain of sars-cov is the rbd that recognizes host angiontensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as its receptor babcock et al 2004 li et al 2003 sui et al 2004 wong et al 2004 xiao et al 2003 the sars-cov rbd is also a major target of neutralizing antibodies he et al 2006 he et al 2005 he et al 2004 huang et al 2006 prabakaran et al 2006 ace2 is a zinc-dependent peptidase that functions in the renin-angiotensin pathway and regulates blood pressure donoghue et al 2000 yagil and yagil 2003 however the physiological function of ace2 is not related to its role as the sars-cov receptor li et al 2005b ace2 contains an n-terminal peptidase domain and a c-terminal collectrin domain the peptidase domain has a claw-like structure with two lobes the enzymatic active site of ace2 is buried in a deep cavity between the two lobes towler et al 2004 the binding interactions between sars-cov rbd and ace2 largely determine the host range and cross-species infections of sars-cov and hence are the focus of this review several lines of research have established receptor recognition as one of the major species barriers between humans and animals for sars-cov infection that is whether a host is susceptible to sars-cov is largely determined by the binding affinity between sars-cov rbd and host ace2 in the initial step of viral attachment first epidemiologic and biochemical studies show that the infectivity of different sars-cov strains in host cells is positively correlated with the binding affinity between the rbd of each strain and ace2 expressed by the host cell li et al 2005b qu et al 2005 song et al 2005 second cell biology studies show that sars-cov infects mouse cells inefficiently because of the poor binding affinity between murine ace2 and sars-cov in contrast mouse cells that express human ace2 on their surface are highly susceptible to sars-cov moore et al 2004 moreover currently known bat sars-cov strains do not infect human cells ren et al 2008 however when their rbd is replaced with the rbd from a human sars-cov strain the synthetic recombinant bat sars-cov strain infects human cells efficiently becker et al 2008 third animal studies show that mice are not effective hosts for sars-cov but transgenic mice that express human ace2 become good hosts for sars-cov mccray et al 2007 tseng et al 2007 fourth reverse genetics studies show that synthetically reconstructed civet sars-cov strains depend completely on ace2 for entry and infection sheahan et al 2008a sheahan et al 2008b therefore all evidence so far has identified receptor recognition as an important limiting step for the cross-species infections of sars-cov in a series of studies my colleagues and i have investigated the interactions between the sars-cov spike protein and ace2 via a combination of electron microscopic and x-ray crystallographic approaches we first collected negative-stain electron microscopic images of the sars-cov spike protein ectodomain and showed that it is a clove-shaped trimer with three individual s1 heads and a trimeric s2 stalk fig 1b li et al 2006a ace2 binds to the tip of the trimeric spike protein ectodomain where the s1 c-domain is located s1 ntd is probably underneath the c-domain these data motivated us to construct a schematic model of the sars-cov invasion machinery to demonstrate the spatial relationships among the different parts of the spike protein and receptor fig 1b we then determined the crystal structure of sars-cov rbd complexed with human ace2 fig 1c li et al 2005a li et al 2006b the structure shows that sars-cov rbd contains two subdomains a core structure and an extended loop the core structure is a five-stranded anti-parallel -sheet with several short connecting -helices the extended loop lies on one edge of the core structure and presents a gently concave surface to interact with the n-terminal lobe of the ace2 peptidase domain because this extended loop makes all the contact with ace2 it has been termed receptor-binding motif rbm fig 2c li et al 2005a overall 14 rbm residues directly contact 18 ace2 residues these structural studies have provided a structural platform for understanding how the spikeace2 interactions determine the cross-species infections and human-to-human transmission of sars-cov to understand the civet-to-human jump and human-to-human transmission of sars-cov we determined more crystal structures of the interfaces between various sars-cov strains and human hace2 or civet ace2 cace2 fig 3
 li 2008 residue 479 is an asparagine in human epidemic viral strain htor02 but a lysine in civet viral strain csz02 figs 2b 3a c hace2 lys31 forms a salt bridge with hace2 glu35 in a hydrophobic environment fig 3a csz02 lys479 would competes with lys31 for glu35 as a salt bridge partner destabilizing the binding interface hence viral mutation k479n increases the rbdhace2 binding affinity the reason why cace2 not hace2 can accommodate lys479 is because cace2 thr31 cannot form a salt bridge with glu35 making glu35 available to form a salt bridge with csz02 lys479 fig 3c thus civet viral strains with lys479 have high affinity for cace2 but not hace2 therefore mutation k479n in sars-cov rbd played an important role in the civet-to-human jump of sars-cov on the other hand residue 487 is a threonine in htro02 but a serine in csz02 figs 2b 3b d lys353 forms a salt bridge with hace2 asp38 in a hydrophobic environment formation of the salt bridge requires support from the methyl group of thr487 fig 3b hence mutation t487s decreases the rbdhace2 affinity the low-pathogenicity human viral strain hcgd03 contains ser487 explaining why it had failed to transmit from human to human in comparison cace2 glu38 has a longer side chain than hace2 asp38 and can form a salt bridge with lys353 in the absence of the support from residue 487 fig 3d thus civet viral strains with ser487 can transmit from civets to civets but not from humans to humans therefore mutation s487t in sars-cov rbd facilitated human-to-human transmission of sars-cov overall our studies suggest that two residue changes between civet and human ace2 t31k and e38d present major species barriers between the two species for sars-cov infections fig 3a these critical residue changes occur at or near two virus-binding hotspots on ace2 one centering on residue 31 hotspot-31 and the other on residue 353 hotspot-353 as a result early civet sars-cov isolates were unable to infect human cells because they were not adapted to the two virus-binding hotspots on human ace2 and sars-cov has evolved to gain sustained infectivity for human cells through stepwise adaptation mutations at residues 479 and 487 in its rbd mutation at residue 479 likely determines whether sars-cov can infect humans whereas mutation at residue 487 largely determines whether sars-cov can maintain sustained infections in humans the structural analysis above has focused on two rbm mutations k479n and s487t which played critical roles in sars-covs evolution to overcome major species barriers between palm civets and humans for cross-species infections however a number of other rbm mutations have been isolated from different sars-cov strains and these mutations are distributed at 5 positions in the rbm 442 472 and 480 as well as 479 and 487 fig 2b c to examine why these rbm mutations were naturally selected we investigated the impact of each mutation on receptor binding using a combination of biochemical virological and crystallographic methods wu et al 2012 using surface plasmon resonance and pseudotyped viral infection assays we found that each of these mutations enhances the binding affinity of rbd to either human ace2 or civet ace2 fig 4
a by determining the crystal structures of mutant sars-cov rbds complexed with human or civet ace2 we showed that these mutations all surround the two virus-binding hotspots on ace2 hotspot-31 and hotspot-353 fig 4b as discussed earlier both of these hotspots consist of a critical salt bridge that is buried in a hydrophobic environment fig 4b in this environment the salt bridges not only provide a significant amount of energy for the virusreceptor binding interaction but also fill critical voids in the hydrophobic stacking interactions at the virusreceptor binding interface consequently each of the rbm mutations in different sars-cov strains enhances viral interactions with either human or civet ace2 by strengthening the hotspot structures fig 4a for example residue 31 is a lysine in human ace2 and rbd residue tyr442 has partial steric clash with the side chain of lys31 and thereby decreases viral binding affinity with human ace2 figs 3a 4b rbd residue phe442 relieves this steric clash and strengthens the structure of hotspot-31 and thus is a viral adaptation to human ace2 on the other hand residue 31 is a threonine in civet ace2 and rbd residue tyr442 forms a hydrogen bond with thr31 and thereby increases viral binding affinity with civet ace2 figs 3c 4b thus rbd residue tyr442 is a viral adaptation to civet ace2 similarly we have elucidated the structural basis for all of the other rbm mutations that were viral adaptations to either human or civet ace2 fig 4a these studies elucidate comprehensive and detailed mechanisms for sars-cov adaptations to human or civet receptor and provide valuable knowledge about the evolutionary strategies that viruses may take for host receptor adaptations we further extended our structural analysis to the interactions between sars-cov rbd and ace2 from mouse rat and bat using human ace2 as the reference molecule we identified key residue changes in these ace2 molecules that disfavor sars-cov binding fig 2a fig 5
 first mouse ace2 contains a critical k353h residue change a histidine at the 353 position of ace2 does not fit into the virusreceptor binding interface as well as a lysine fig 5a consequently mice support sars-cov infections inefficiently second rat ace2 contains two residue changes that disfavor sars-cov binding in addition to the k353h residue change as in mouse ace2 rat ace2 also contains an m82n residue change which introduces a glycosylation site a glycan at the 82 position of ace2 would lead to steric interference with sars-cov binding fig 5b consequently rats are resistant to sars-cov infections third a number of ace2 molecules have been isolated from different bat species with diverse amino acid sequences hou et al 2010 none of these bat ace2 molecules functions as an effective receptor for currently known sars-cov strains among them ace2 from daubentons bat supports sars-cov infections at low levels compared with human ace2 daubentons bat ace2 contains three critical residue changes k31n e35k and y41h the k31n and e35k residue changes may turn the k31-e35 salt bridge to a weaker n31-k35 hydrogen bond fig 5c whereas the y41h residue change likely weakens the support for the k353-d38 salt bridge because histidine is a poorer hydrophobic stacker than tyrosine fig 5d thus these residue changes in daubentons bat ace2 decrease the rbdace2 binding affinity overall our studies have identified critical residue changes between human ace2 and mouse rat or bat ace2 that serve as major species barriers for sars-cov infections sars-cov adaptations to mouse ace2 have been explored frieman et al 2012 roberts et al 2007 although human sars-cov strains did not infect mice efficiently they could adapt to mice through serial passage in the respiratory tract of young mice and cause lethal diseases a number of mutations were identified in these mouse-adapted sars-cov strains nearly all of these mutations are located in the rbm region of the spike protein and surround the two virus-binding hotspots on mouse ace2 although biochemical and structural studies have not been done to characterize the impact of these mutations on receptor binding these mutations presumably enhance the binding of the rbd to mouse ace2 for example a y436h mutation repeatedly emerged during sars-cov adaptations to mice at the interface of htor02 rbd and human ace2 rbd tyr436 forms a hydrogen bond with hace2 asp38 providing support to the k353-d38 salt bridge at hotspot-353 fig 4b in mouse ace2 residue 353 is a histidine which is unlikely to form a salt bridge with asp38 instead rbd his436 in the mouse-adapted sars-cov strains may form a strong hydrogen bond with asp38 partially compensating for the loss of the k353-d38 salt bridge detailed mechanisms of these mouse-adapted sars-cov mutations still wait to be characterized by structural and biochemical studies the structural analysis reviewed above allowed us to summarize the host range and cross-species infections of sars-cov fig 6
 bat cells do not support efficient infections of civet or human sars-cov strains because of residue changes eg k31n e35k and y41h in their ace2 however given the diversities of bat ace2 molecules it is possible that future studies will identify a bat ace2 that supports sars-cov infections on the other hand currently known bat sars-cov strains cannot jump from bats to civets or humans because of truncations in their rbms fig 2b significant evolution would be needed for these rbms to acquire sufficient binding affinity for civet or human ace2 once sars-cov had jumped from bats to civets it underwent further mutations in civets the first k479n mutation allowed sars-cov to jump from civets to humans and the second s487t mutation allowed sars-cov to transmit from human to human leading to the severe sars outbreak in 20022003 in the following year sars-cov only acquired the k479n mutation but not the s487t mutation leading to the sporadic sars infections with no human-to-human transmission mice support sars-cov infection at low levels because of the k353h residue change in their ace2 and rats are resistant to sars-cov infection because of the k353h and m82n double residue changes in sum critical residue changes in animal ace2 molecules present species barriers for sars-cov infections through natural evolutions of its rbd at key positions sars-cov overcame the species barriers between some animal species eg between bats and civets and between civets and humans but not others eg between civets and mice or between civets and rats predictions of future evolution of a virus are a difficult if not completely impossible task however our detailed structural analysis of the host receptor adaptation mutations in sars-cov rbd has allowed us to predict design and test optimized sars-cov rbds that may resemble future evolved forms of the virus fig 7
 wu et al 2012 for example a form of rbd optimized to bind human ace2 human-optimized form contains all of the hace2-adapted residues phe-442 phe-472 asn-479 asp-480 and thr-487 it has exceptionally high affinity for hace2 but lower affinity for cace2 a form of rbd optimized to bind civet ace2 civet-optimized form contains all of the cace2-adapted residues tyr-442 pro-472 arg-479 gly-480 and thr-487 it possesses exceptionally high affinity for cace2 and importantly also harbors substantial affinity for hace2 to our knowledge this was the first and has been the only case of knowledge-based prediction of viral evolution that leads to improved receptor-binding affinities will sars come back if it does in what form will it be back our studies suggest that if sars-cov were given the opportunity to keep infecting humans and evolving in human cells htor02 rbd might evolve into the human-optimized form by acquiring two mutations at the 442 and 472 positions fig 7 luckily however sars-cov has been absent in humans since 20032004 nevertheless sars-cov could still be infecting and evolving in wild palm civets in fact the chb05 strain was isolated from wild palm civets in 2005 liu et al 2007 two years after the sars epidemic additionally the chb05 strain appears to be significantly better adapted to civet ace2 than the csz02 strain isolated during the sars epidemic having acquired mutations at positions 472 479 and 480 fig 2b fig 4a fig 7 alarmingly the chb05 strain is only one mutation s487t away from evolving into the civet-optimized form with substantial affinity for human ace2 fig 7 overall our research provides a molecular and structural blueprint for tracking and predicting future sars-cov evolution in animals which helps prevent and control potential future sars outbreaks in the human population the newly emerged mers-cov shares clinical and genetic features with sars-cov like sars-cov mers-cov often causes acute pneumonia and renal failure in patients in addition mers-cov also belongs to the -genus and its s1 c-domain has been identified to be the rbd du et al 2013 mou et al 2013 but unlike sars-cov mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as its receptor raj et al 2013 crystal structures of mers-cov rbd have recently been determined either by itself or in complex with its receptor dpp4 chen et al 2013 lu et al 2013 wang et al 2013 mers-cov rbd also contains a core structure and an accessory subdomain the latter of which functions as rbm the core structures of mers-cov and sars-cov rbds are highly similar but their rbms are markedly different resulting in recognition of different receptors like sars-cov mers-cov also likely originated from bats because the genomic sequence of mers-cov is closely related to those of certain bat coronaviruses annan et al 2013 holmes and dominguez 2013 lau et al 2013 moreover mers-cov is able to infect both human and bat cells and appears to recognize both human and bat dpp4 molecules these findings suggest that mers-cov may be able to transmit from bats to humans and then from human to human with little or no adaptation in its rbd details of the host range and cross-species infections of mers-cov will need to be characterized by future genetic biochemical and structural studies research on sars-covreceptor interactions has elucidated the structural basis for the cross-species infections and human-to-human transmission of sars-cov and has also provided a structural framework for monitoring and predicting future sars-cov evolution in animals these studies have established several important principles on host receptor adaptations and cross-species infections of viruses first one or a few seemingly trivial mutations at the receptor-binding surface of a virus may lead to dramatic epidemic outcomes by facilitating cross-species infections and human-to-human transmission of the virus second one or a few residue changes in the virus-binding region of a host receptor protein may determine the hosts fate and role in a viral epidemic by presenting species barriers for viral infections third predictions of future viral evolution may be possible if virusreceptor interactions can be understood in great structural detail these principles may apply to other emerging animal viruses including the newly emerged mers-cov what are the remaining important questions regarding the host range and cross-species infections of sars-cov first what receptor do currently known bat sars-cov strains use when they infect bat cells to solve this problem it will be important to determine whether the bat receptor is an unidentified form of bat ace2 or an entirely new receptor second what is the detailed structural mechanism by which bat sars-cov strains adapted to civet ace2 for the critical bat-to-civet jump it is possible that none of the currently known bat sars-cov strains was able to adapt to civet or human ace2 owing to the significant differences between their rbds and the rbds from the civet or human sars-cov strains thus currently known bat sars-cov strains were unlikely to be the immediate precursors of the civet or human sars-cov strains that caused the 20022003 sars epidemic instead there may exist one or several hitherto unidentified bat sars-cov strains that not only use bat ace2 as their receptor but can also adapt to and recognize civet ace2 with relative ease hence finding these bat sars-cov strains will fill in an important missing link associated with the sars epidemic in sum as the natural reservoir for sars-cov mers-cov and many other coronaviruses bats should be carefully studied for how they support coronavirus infections and how coronaviruses may jump from bats to other animal species and pose threats to humans  interpatient mutational spectrum of human coronavirusoc43 revealed by illumina sequencing geoffrey gorse j gira patel b xiaofeng fan   human coronavirusoc43 hcovoc43 is within the betacoronavirus genus family coronaviridae and is an enveloped positive sense singlestranded rna virus1 2 there are five known genotypes and other betacoronaviruses include severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov3 hcovoc43 is prevalent among humans and genotype d has been prominent in recent years3 4 5 little is known about how hcovoc43 genotypes persist in human populations but continuous adaptation by viral antigenic genes in the spike protein through genetic drift may be necessary the spike protein is the major antigenic protein and is under selection pressure by the host immune response it is important for host range and tissue tropism it is cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits for receptor binding and membrane fusion the nterminal domain of the s1 subunit is responsible for sugar receptor binding and the s2 subunit is responsible for fusion of viral and host membranes6 the s1 subunit is more divergent in sequence and the s2 subunit is more conserved1 2 3 7
 human coronaviruses cause the common cold and influenzalike illnesses but can be associated with more severe illnesses such as pneumonia exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease croup and bronchiolitis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studied during the 19981999 influenza season 135 of illnesses were associated with hcov229e and hcovoc43 infection while in another study between 2009 and 2013 19 of acute respiratory illnesses in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases and 215 in healthy young adults were associated with hcov8 9 10 11 coronavirusassociated illness was less severe than influenza but was associated with multiple respiratory and systemic symptoms and hospitalization10 hcov229e and hcovoc43 infection rates of 2826 in healthy young and elderly adults highrisk adults and hospitalized patients were reported during the winters of 19992003 and they contributed to medical disease burden12
 little is known about the degree of heterogeneity of hcovoc43 viral quasispecies present in upper respiratory secretions if present this may help explain persistent incidence of hcovoc43 infections in human populations if the mutational changes result in antigenic drift this might allow escape from host immunity and contribute to virus infectivity and pathogenicity in the current study we combined rtpcr and illumina sequencing to measure the diversity of hcovoc43 spike gene quasispecies through direct count of the spike gene mutations determination of percent nonsynonymous mutation rates and comparison of these rates to hcv which is in the genus hepacivirus family flaviviridae hcv is an rna virus with a heterogeneous population of quasispecies in chronically infected patients13 14 15
 we studied nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens that were obtained from each of four patients early during symptomatic acute respiratory illness and positive for hcovoc43 nucleic acids by multiplex rtpcr11 serum and nasal wash specimens were obtained at the time of acute illness and 34 weeks after illness onset they were assayed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay for serum igg and nasal wash iga antibodies to tissue cultureadapted hcovoc43 american type culture collection vr1558 genbank nc0051471 that was inactivated by psoralen compound and longwavelength ultraviolet light as described10 11 16 severity of acute respiratory illness was measured by two scores a selfreported visual analogue scale of overall illness severity ranging from 1 mildest to 10 most severe and a severity of influenzalike symptoms and signs score that was the sum of 16 symptoms and signs that were graded on a scale of 0 absent15 most severe with a maximum score of 240 as described10 11 17 respiratory and systemic symptoms of the acute illness were recorded the patients gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the institutional review boards at the va st louis health care system and saint louis university two recombinant clones from a previous study 1701 and 1709 each containing a 9022 bp hcv insert were used to estimate potential errors associated with illumina sequencing14 15 also 19 hcv genotype 1a samples from an earlier report3 were available for reanalysis and comparison in the current study total rna from each nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimen sample was purified using the qiaamp ultrasens virus kit qiagen valencia ca according to the manufacturers procedures rtpcr was then applied to amplify a 4529 bp amplicon spanning the fulllength spike gene 4086 bp in brief 106 l of extracted rna was mixed with 94 l rt matrix consisting of 1x superscript iii buffer 10 mm dtt 1 m oc43r1 reverse primer 5tgc ccc aca tac cac aca g3 position 28 16428 182 numbering is according to hcovoc43 strain genbank accession number ay391777 2 mm dntps 20 u of rnase out recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor and 200 u of superscript iii reverse transcriptase life technologies after 75 min incubation at 50c and subsequent inactivation an aliquot of 5 l of rt reaction was applied for the first round of pcr that contained 1x gc enhancer new england biolabs 1x q5 buffer new england biolabs 16 mm dntps 04 m oc43f1 forward primer 5gta cag gtt gtt gat tcg cg3 position 23 21023 229 04 m oc43r1 and 16 u q5 high fidelity dna polymerase new england biolabs after initial heating at 94c for 1 min cycle parameters were programmed as the first 10 cycles of 94c for 30 sec 65c for 30 sec and 68c for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of 94c for 30 sec 60c for 30 sec and 68 c for 5 min with a 2 sec autoextension at each cycle two l of the first round of pcr product was used for the second round amplification with primers oc43f2 forward primer 5tct ggc ctc tct acc cct atg gc3 position 23 43923 461 and oc43r2 reverse primer 5ctt gat tac ggc acc aag cat gac3 position 27 94427 967 under the same cycle parameters as the first round of pcr product at expected size was gelpurified using qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen and quantitated about 45 g of purified dna product was subjected to library construction the fragment library was constructed using illumina nextera xt dna library preparation kit and followed by illumina sequencing on nextseq 500 machine with 1  250 bp read output we first estimated the error rate associated with illumina sequencing using two recombinant hcv clones in doing so raw sequence reads in fastq format were first filtered in prinseq v 0195 for quality control including read length 70 bp mean read quality score 25 low complexity with dust score 7 ambiguous bases 1 and all duplicates18 filtered reads were mapped onto hcv genotype 1a prototype strain h77 genbank accession number ay009606 using a gapped aligner bowtie 219 mapped files were then converted into binary format bam sorted and indexed in samtools20 followed by local realignment and base quality recalibration in genome analysis toolkit gatk21 next by converting postalignment bam files into mpileup format in samtools the consensus sequence for each clone was called in varscan v 223 with the settings of 1000 x coverage 25 base quality at a position to count a read and 50 mutation frequency22 23 the entire pipeline was repeated using individual consensus sequences mutations were called at each position in varscan under the setting of 05 frequency and base quality from 15 to 40 followed by manual check in the integrative genomics viewer22
 using the value of base quality to define a mutation from above analysis similar procedures were applied to four patient samples the hcovoc43 strain genbank ay391777 was used as the reference at initial mapping over the entire coronavirus spike gene the mutation load the total number of mutations at a given site was counted through sliding windows size  300 bp overlap  100 bp finally under the frame of fulllength hcov spike gene 4086 bp the nature of each mutation either synonymous or nonsynonymous was determined using a custom script24
 the consensus fulllength hcov spike sequences from four patients and reference sequences retrieved from genbank were used for phylogenetic analysis the tree was constructed using neighborjoining approach under nucleotide substitution model of maximum composite likelihood in mega program version 5225
 statistical analyses were done with either twotailed unpaired students test or chisquare when applicable data were expressed as mean value and standard deviation p  005 was considered statistically significant raw sequence data in fastq format from all four patient samples were archived in ncbi sequence read archive sra under sra accession number srp071020 samples 3 and 4 both genotype d were collected within a month of each other in december 2010 and january 2011 from two older patients with significant acute respiratory and systemic symptoms table 1 the patients had underlying chronic cardiopulmonary diseases and diabetes mellitus the two illnesses were associated with greater than a fourfold increase in nasal wash iga antibody titers but only one with at least a fourfold increase in serum igg antibody titer to hcovoc43 comparing acute illness to convalescent specimens collected 34 weeks after illness onset table 1 samples from subjects two and 6 both genotype b were collected about 2 years apart in january 2010 and march 2012 from a younger patient without underlying chronic illnesses and an older patient with cardiac disease and diabetes mellitus both had acute respiratory and systemic symptoms that may have been less severe than those reported by the two patients with genotype d isolates table 1 one of the two illnesses with genotype b viruses was associated with a greater than fourfold increase in nasal wash iga antibody titer to hcovoc43 but neither had a fourfold rise in serum igg antibody titer to hcovoc43 comparing acute illness to convalescent specimens collected 34 weeks after illness onset table 1 the raw data output indicated 701 of bases read had a quality score greater than 30 interpretation of the distribution statistics of base quality scores over read length resulted in trimming the read length at the 3 end by 610 the final results of the quality control are shown in supplemental table the large output gave a very deep base coverage for each hcov sample the average was 94 899  21 405 supplemental fig s1 to estimate the error rate associated with library construction and illumina sequencing mutations were called from two recombinant hcv clones 1701 and 1709 under a range of base quality settings even if a mutation was counted under the base quality as low as 15 there were no differences in the consensus sequences derived either from illumina or from genewalking sanger sequencing data not shown however the number of individual mutations had a sharp drop from the base quality 2530 supplemental fig s2 under the conditions of 05 mutation frequency and base quality score of 30 there were a total of 31 mutations in the two hcv clone samples suggesting an error rate of about 176 mutations per kb applying the same criteria for the coronavirus samples a total of 121 mutations for all four samples were identified with an average number of mutations of 303  102 range 2040 mutations per sample which is significantly higher than that expected from the illumina sequencing error rate 121 vs 2876 mutations p  42  1014 nonsynonymous mutations accounted for between 61 and 90 of the total mutations table 2 no deletions or recombinations were detected of the 121 viral mutations those with frequencies greater than 2 occurred at six positions spike gene position numbers 79 81 1229 1859 2244 and 2858 table 3 using a sliding window analysis with window size  300 bp and overlaps  100 bp there were two mutation peaks one at the 5 end and the other at about spike gene position number 1550 fig 1 using consensus sequences a neighborjoining tree showed phylogenetically that two of the subjects samples were genotype d and two were genotype b strains of hcovoc43 fig 2a and b the two genotype b samples both had high mutation frequencies at spike gene nucleotide positions 79 3692 and 4512 and 81 796 and 707 whereas the two genotype d samples had mutation frequencies of 092 and 082 at position 81 and less than 05 for position 79 a previously reported study found that hcv genotype 1a patients experiencing relapse after antiviral treatment n  19 had a higher average total mutation load measured through 454 sequencing26 these samples were reanalyzed for the current study using a base quality score 30 rather than 25 in the earlier report26 the average mutation load in hcv patient isolates was significantly higher than in hcovoc43 patient isolates 2962  1022 vs 303  102 p  77  105 however nonsynonymous mutations as a percentage of the total mutations were higher among the hcovoc43 isolates than among the 19 hcv genotype 1a patient isolates 767  14 vs 26  8 p  35  109 the alignment of spike genes of consensus amino acid sequences show differences between the four clinical strains and the prototype ay391777 strain particularly at the n and c terminal ends of the s1 subunit and at the s1 and s2 subunit cleavage site aa 762766 with a smaller number of amino acid differences in the s2 subunit fig 3 the high genetic mutation rates at sites 79 and 81 correspond to several amino acid changes compared to the prototype strain between amino acid positions 20 and 31 through illumina sequencing we have introduced highresolution hcovoc43 spike gene mutational load to quantify viral quasispecies population diversity the experimental method allows the role of hcovoc43 spike gene heterogeneity to be investigated in a manner not previously reported the hcovoc43 spike gene does have quasispecies but the magnitude is almost 10 times lower than the quasispecies found in hcv while the nonsynonymous mutations take a higher percentage of the total mutation load for hcovoc43 than hcv genotype 1a it should be noted that the spike gene was amplified with the genespecific primers although these primers are located in the conserved hcov he and ns2 domains the missing of potentially heterogeneous viral variants during the amplification cannot be excluded as a consequence quasispecies diversity of hcov may be underestimated in the current study in comparison to the use of degenerate primers or primerindependent approaches viral replicative dynamics population size and host immune responses may contribute to this observation and the finding has implications in terms of hcov evolution and treatment high mutation load facilitates the evolution of viral populations in response to external pressure given their slightly deleterious nature27 however excessive nonsynonymous mutations can be detrimental to such adaptive evolution28 consequently accumulation of deleterious mutation load during viral infection may contribute to selflimited active infection in the case of hcovoc43 this could contribute to short selflimited respiratory tract infections compared to hcv which is a chronic systemic viral infection with ongoing viral replication however genetic diversity manifested by a cloud of quasispecies in some viral systems can be linked to pathogenicity and shown to allow adaptation to new environments such as infection of new hosts29 if clonal virus populations are present in human infections with merscov30 31 this could increase the chances of epidemic spread of a particularly virulent strain32 infections with a cloud of viral strains may enhance spread for instance by increasing the chance of a virulent strain being transmitted or reduce it due to defective and less virulent strains being present merscov genome sequences from dromedary camels indicate presence of quasispecies in single samples30 recent deep sequencing analyses reported intrapatient viral heterogeneity during a 2015 outbreak of merscov and the possibility that host immune response provided selection pressure to favor genetic heterogeneity33 34 intrapatient viral heterogeneity may have contributed to transmissibility33
 our four clinical isolates were of the genotypes b and d which have been described as circulating in recent years rather than genotype a4 alignment of spike gene consensus amino acid sequences compared to the ay391777 prototype strain sequence genotype a indicates the majority of changes were in the s1 subunit the proteolytic cleavage site of s1 and s2 subunits for the four clinical strains in our study had the rrsrr motif rather than the rrsrg motif of the prototype strain this g to r substitution at amino acid 766 may result in increased cleavability and the cleavage process may play a part in fusion activity and viral infectivity4 35
 there were minimal amino acid changes at spike gene nucleotide positions 448459 whole genome positions 24 09124 102 in the glomerular part of the spike gene encoding the tqdg aa positions 150153 and low mutation frequencies in that region for our four clinical isolates although all four had a y154v substitution this is in the lectin domain of the s1 subunit involved in attachment of the virus to the cellular receptor which is a derivative of neuraminic acid36 the tqdg sequence may have evolutionary and functional importance is not present in the closely related bovine coronaviruses and not inserted in some strains of hcovoc4336 four critical sugarbinding residues y168 e188 w190 and h191 were present in our hcovoc43 isolates corresponding to y162 e182 w184 and h185 in the bovine coronavirus sequence37
 the receptorbinding of sarscov in the s1 carboxyterminal domain around the receptor binding motif involving amino acids 479 and 487 are areas where nonsynonymous substitutions and genetic diversity occurred for our hcovoc43 isolate sequences these areas are important for binding affinity to human angiotensinconverting enzyme two for sarscov and host immune responses38 our isolates had nonsynonymous substitutions at amino acid residues 259 and 260264 in the nterminal domain of s1 and in particular had nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions within the region between amino acids 471 and 550 at a putative receptor binding domain of hcovoc43 aa positions 3395494 in other hcov strains for instance hcov229e antibody neutralization of the virus is dependent on the antigenic phenotype of the s1 subunit region39 hence this may also be a factor for hcovoc43 needing further study our patients all had acute upper respiratory and systemic signs and symptoms the small number evaluated here precludes conclusions about pathogenicity and viral mutation rate patterns but this approach opens up pathways to future study in conclusion quasispecies were present in our hcovoc43 strains involving areas of the s1 subunit of the spike gene that may affect evolution of the viral binding process and antigenicity as well as host specificity further studies are needed to more fully characterize the extent of quasispecies in more clinical isolates and their relation to disease characteristics and host immune responses nonsynonymous mutations were more frequent than synonymous ones contributing to the hypothesis that the mutations are important to viral persistence in the human population over time and to disease pathogenesis  spread of mutant middle east respiratory

pathogen first identified in the kingdom of saudi arabia in 2012 causes an acute and severe respiratory illness with a high mortality rate in humans 1 as of 20 september 2015 1569 laboratory-confirmed human infections have been reported to the world health organization who including 554 deaths case fatality rate 353 2 although the majority of the reported cases are associated with sporadic outbreaks in the countries of the middle east 3 more than 200 cases occurred outside the middle east region and are primarily linked to recent travel to the middle east 2 these cases include an unexpected large outbreak 186 confirmed cases with 38 deaths in south korea from may to july 2015 4 similar to other large outbreaks in saudi arabia 3 5 the south korean mers outbreak was mainly associated with health care settings and was accelerated by interhospital spread 4 although early genomic analysis of mers-cov revealed that the respiratory pathogen is closely related to a bat coronavirus belonging to the genus betacoronavirus 6 accumulating evidence support dromedary camels as a reservoir host and the primary source of human infection 79 a viral mers-cov spike s protein has been suggested to be a critical viral factor for host tropism via its interaction with a host receptor cd26 10 11 but the evolutionary pathway of mers-cov for human adaptation remains unclear the efficacy of direct human-to-human spread in the community seems to be quite low as the rate of human transmission among household contacts of mers patients has been approximately 5 based on serological analysis 12 however ongoing sporadic outbreaks highlight the importance of early nosocomial superspreading events in secondary human infections before active case detection and implementation of interventions 13 there were also typical superspreading events fueling the unexpected large outbreak in south korea the index case patient a returning from the middle east generated 38 cases of secondary infections two patients patient d and e of the second wave of infection or generation were linked to at least 81 and 23 cases of the third generation respectively fig 1 4 the rapid and wide spread of mers-cov during the south korean outbreak raised strong concerns about the possible generation of mutations with enhanced sequential human infection in this study we analyzed mers-cov genomes isolated from 13 patients admitted to chungnam national university hospital one of the designated national safe hospitals during the south korean outbreak and compared them to recently reported genomes from two south korean patients 14 15 and others deposited in the genbank database the transmission chain of mers-cov and the timeline of potential viral exposure symptom onset and date of genome collection from the patients admitted to chungnam national university hospital are presented in fig 1 this patient pool includes a secondary infection case patient e who had close contact with the index case patient a in hospital p eleven cases patients f g h i j k l m n o and p of the third wave of infection or generation and two cases patients r and s of the fourth generation are also included in this study two patients f and g of 11 tertiary cases visited hospital s where at least 81 infections occurred infected by patient d while the remaining 9 tertiary cases patients h to p were patients or care givers at hospitals d and g where 23 cases were generated by patient e clinical characteristics of the patients including incubation period fever duration and the presence of pneumonia are summarized in table s1 in the supplemental material among the 14 cases 9 patients completely recovered and 5 patients expired fatal cases include an 82-year-old female and four patients who had comorbid diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or liver cirrhosis table s1 we isolated and sequenced the whole viral genomes from respiratory secretions from the 13 patients fig 1 genome sequences from south korean patients b and c that were recently reported by the republic of korea centers for disease control and prevention korean cdc genbank accession number kt029139 14 and the chinese center for disease control and prevention chinese cdc genbank accession numbers kt006149 and kt036372 15 respectively were also analyzed together with the new viral genomes when we compared the viral genomes isolated from the 13 south korean patients with all the mers-cov genomes available in genbank as of 20 september 2015 99 genomes with more than 90 coverage 26 mutations were found only in the south korean isolates fig 2 see table s2 in the supplemental material fourteen of these mutations are nonsynonymous mutations that result in changes of amino acids in orf1a s and orf4b six mutations were observed in orf1a seven mutations were observed in the s protein and there was one deletion mutation in orf4b that causes a frameshift and fusion of orf4b and orf5 four mutations d977g and g6896s in orf1a and i529t and v718i in s were detected in more than one isolate we observed no change at position r1020 of the s protein which is the only codon predicted to be under positive selection in the viral genome 16 it is worth noting that the d510g and i529t mutations in the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s protein 17 result in a change in amino acid properties acidic aspartate d to hydrophobic glycine g and hydrophobic isoleucine i to polar threonine t respectively moreover the mutations in rbd especially i529t emerged in patients of the second generation patient e and spread to the third and fourth generations of patients within a month fig 1 we thus assessed whether nonsynonymous mutations in the rbd of the s protein affect interactions with the cognate human receptor cd26 by structural analysis both mutations d510g and i529t are located on the interfacial region of the s protein fig 3a we found that both mutations introduced energetically unfavorable interactions to the s-proteincd26 interface specifically d510 of the s protein is located on the interfacial loop and interacts directly with cd26 residues fig 3b see table s3 in the supplemental material the d510g mutation disrupts the ionic interaction with r317 of cd26 moreover i529 is located on the backside of the s-proteincd26 interface fig 3c table s4 the i529t mutation introduces a polar side chain to a hydrophobic residue cluster l506 l554 and a556 and therefore potentially affects the energetic stability of the interfacial beta sheets of rbd in order to quantify the binding affinity of the mutant rbds d510g and i529t to cd26 we performed surface plasmon resonance spr experiments with purified rbd proteins fig 3d in our studies wild-type rbd binds to cd26 with a dissociation constant kd of 645 nm kon 145  104 m1 s1 koff 936  104 s1 which is slightly lower but comparable to the 167 nm measured in previous studies 17 the difference might be due to having fixed cd26 on the chip for the spr assay whereas rbd was fixed in the previous experiment 17 the i529t mutant rbd binds to cd26 with a kd of 293 nm kon 403  103 m1 s1 koff 118  103 s1 which is almost 45 times lower than wild-type rbd in the case of d510g rbd it binds to cd26 with a kd of 316 nm kon 502  103 m1 s1 koff 159  103 s1 which is almost 49 times lower than wild-type rbd and as expected by structural prediction to further confirm the reduced affinity purified rbd mutants were analyzed for cd26 binding in 293t cells stably expressing cd26 see fig s1 in the supplemental material by flow cytometry assay as shown in fig 4a mutated rbds bind to 293t cells overexpressing cd26 with different efficacies the d510g substitution increased the 50 effective concentration ec50 by twofold ec50  024 gml whereas the ec50 of the i529t rbd mutant was almost 20 times higher ec50  237 gml than that of wild-type rbd ec50  012 gml in addition the maximum binding of the two mutant rbds was saturated at approximately 80 of wild-type rbd finally we investigated the biological relevance of the i529t mutation in s protein by using a pseudotyped lentivirus bearing the mutant s protein fig 4b the i529t mutation in s protein significantly lowered 25 the efficiency of viral entry into 293t cells overexpressing cd26 compared to that of virus bearing wild-type s protein the basal level of viral entry in the control cells 293t-vector was not changed and the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus g protein vsv-g-pseudotyped virus was not significantly affected by the expression of cd26 in the host cells suggesting that the reduction in viral entry by the i529t mutation is specifically dependent on its interaction with cd26 considering the genetic stability of the s protein in mers-cov genomes reported thus far 16 it is quite interesting to note the rapid emergence and subsequent conservation of the rbd i529t mutation in consecutive human infections since it is generally thought that interspecies transmission of coronaviruses is primarily mediated by mutations in the s protein with enhanced affinity toward human receptors 18 this unexpected emergence and wide spread of an rbd mutation with reduced affinity to human cd26 during human-to-human spread in the south korean mers outbreak raises several critical questions first the mutation rate of mers-cov may be different during sequential human spread based on the results of our genomic analysis however genomes from each generation have only one to three nucleotide changes at most see table s2 in the supplemental material in addition when we isolated and sequenced two viral genomes in a patient patient h fig 1 separated by a 6-day interval we failed to observe any detectable changes data not shown it has also been reported that only a few or no differences were found in nucleotide sequences between the genomes from samples from a single patient taken 1 day to 2 weeks later 19 20 second the mutations in the rbd of s protein might be generated to better suit polymorphisms of cd26 specific to the south korean population indeed it has been shown that the difference in interface residues among the host receptors of different mammalian species is critical to triggering interspecies transmission of coronavirus 18 however our preliminary analysis of cd26 sequences encoding the interface domain in the south korean patients failed to show any substantial difference data not shown third the mutations observed in the south korean outbreak could affect the severity of disease caused by mers since the number of patients whose viral genomes are currently available is limited direct demonstration of a correlation is not yet possible we could not distinguish a specific correlation using the epidemiological and clinical information of the 15 cases listed in table s1 in the supplemental material functional analyses of the mutations fig 2 in viral pathogenesis or infectivity need to be performed considering that the case fatality rate 199 of the south korean outbreak is lower than the overall mortality rate of all mers cases 35 the spread of the rbd i529t mutation with reduced affinity to human cd26 receptor as well as earlier diagnosis and quarantine during the outbreak 21 is potentially associated with milder consequences although the differences in health care settings among the nations where mers is endemic need to be taken into account to make a direct comparison in addition to mutations in the s protein a deletion of three nucleotides tta in orf4b expired patient k leading to a fusion of orf4b and orf5 fig 1 table s2 is notable since these proteins are known to function as antagonists of type 1 interferon signaling 22 finally is the reduced affinity to host receptor cd26 by rbd mutations linked to transmissibility of mers-cov and how are these viral mutations selected and maintained during human-to-human transmission currently we are not able to calculate and compare the reproduction rate of mers-cov infections during the south korean outbreak due to the limited availability of information on the patients infected with the mutant viruses however the available s gene sequences isolated from korean patients revealed that 72 1825 of the patients including three superspreaders patients 1 14 and 16 were infected with mers-cov carrying the i529t mutated s protein fig 5 20 23 remarkably wild-type rbd sequences were found in several second- and third-generation patients and the d510g mutation was found in two patients of the third and fourth generations fig 5 the original virus carried by the index patient may have carried the i529t mutation and it may have converted to wild-type or mutant viruses bearing the d510g mutation in the s protein during human-to-human spread in order to elucidate the evolutionary pathway of the s gene mutations during sequential human infection more-detailed analysis needs to be conducted using genomic sequences isolated from more south korean patients nevertheless it was shown that the south korean outbreak followed a progression similar to those of previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses with early superspreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary and tertiary infections and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations 13 it is thought that human adaptation of animal coronavirus might be achieved through sequential mutations that enhance the affinity of s protein to the human receptor as demonstrated in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov evolution 24 however the results of our current study showing the rapid and wide spread of an rbd mutant with reduced affinity to human receptor generates evidence that do not support this hypothesis interestingly previous reports showed that a neutralizing antibody against mers-cov may contribute not only to mers-cov clearance but also to viral evolution 25 treatment of a neutralizing antibody to in vitro infection media generated several escape mutations in the rbd of mers-cov the majority of the escape mutations had a negative impact on cd26 receptor binding and viral fitness 25 in line with what we observed in our current study it was shown that rbd mutations l506f t512a y540c and r542g generated by neutralizing antibody pressure decreases rbd binding affinity to cd26 resulting in a profound loss of neutralizing antibody binding activity 25 based on these results it was proposed that the immunodominance of human neutralizing antibody response to rbd-cd26 interface can restrict mers-cov evolution by driving the virus down an escape pathway that predominantly results in a significant cost in viral fitness considering that i529t and d510g mutations emerged and were conserved in the majority of viral genomes isolated from south korean patients fig 5 these natural variations with reduced affinity to cd26 may also have been produced in response to neutralizing antibodies exerting an in vivo selection pressure decreased virulence of the neutralization escape mutants also coincided with reduced affinity of the mutant sars s protein for its ace2 receptor 26 further analysis on the interaction of neutralizing antibodies generated in infected patients and the mutant viruses needs to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis mers-cov genome sequences were obtained from the patients respiratory samples after ethical approval granted by the institutional review boards of chungnam national university hospital and seoul national university hospital the clinical samples collected for viral diagnosis before consent of the patients were used for viral sequencing analysis after the ethical approval these procedures were approved by the institutional review boards all the patients who recovered provided their written informed consent to participation in the cases of patients who died we obtained exemption of patients consent for the analysis of viral sequences from the institutional review boards of chungnam national university hospital and seoul national university hospital nucleic acid extracts from pcr-confirmed mers patients were processed for reverse transcription and pcr amplification using a modified version of methods described previously 16 briefly rnas were extracted from sputum or tracheal aspirate samples using trizol ls reagent thermo fisher scientific according to the manufacturers instructions the mers-cov rna genome was converted to dna and amplified by pcr in 30 overlapping amplicons using the primer sets listed in table s5 in the supplemental material all amplicons were gel purified and sequenced directly using an abi-3730xl dna analyzer applied biosystems and the contigs were assembled using seqman version 70 dnastar lasergene usa the 13 new genomes were aligned with the 101 published mers-cov genomes using muscle 27 and mega6 software 28 the complex structure of mers-cov spike rbd bound to cd26 pdb identification id or accession number 4kr0 were used to analyze the effects of d510g and i529t mutations 17 mutations were highlighted using pymol httpwwwpymolorg foldx httpfoldxcrges was used to calculate the changes in the energetic stability of residues g in wild-type and mutant rbd structures 29 interfacial residues in rbd were identified by

reveal founder effects across geographical regions carlos farkas francisco fuentes-villalobos jose garrido luis jody haigh mara barra ins scott edwards   the covid-19 pandemic caused by a novel 2019 sars coronavirus known as sars-cov-2 is rapidly spreading worldwide greatly surpassing the 8000 total cases of the 20022004 sars coronavirus outbreak sars-cov-1 after 1 month of the initially identified case on 31 december 2019 in wuhan city china wilder-smith chiew  lee 2020 as sars-cov-2 is human-to-human transmitted it is a threat to the global population it is critical to understand sars-cov-2 characteristics to deal with this ongoing pandemic and to develop future treatments sars-cov-2 virus is an enveloped positive-stranded rna virus with a large genome 299 kb belonging to the family coronaviridae order nidovirales de wit et al 2016 one of the striking genomic features of this novel virus is the presence of a novel furin-like cleavage site in the s-protein of the virus which differs from sars-cov-1 and may have implications for the life cycle and pathogenicity of the novel virus coutard et al 2020 wu et al 2020a firstly it was suggested that sars-cov-2 is a close relative of the ratg13 bat-derived coronavirus around 88 identity rather than of sars-cov-1 79 identity or middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 50 identity lu et al 2020 due to this association with bat coronaviruses it was also argued that sars-cov-2 virus has the potential to spread into another species as bat coronaviruses do hu et al 2018 although bats are likely natural reservoir hosts for sars-cov-2 it was recently demonstrated that sars-cov-2 is closely related to a pangolin coronavirus pangolin-cov found in dead malayan pangolins with a 9102 identity the closest relationship found so far for sars-cov-2 zhang wu  zhang 2020 in that study genomic analyses revealed that the s1 protein of pangolin-cov is related closer to sars-cov-2 than to ratg13 coronavirus also five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with the human ace2 receptor are maintained in pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 but not in ratg13 coronavirus thus it is likely pangolins are an intermediate host in the transmission of coronaviruses between bats and humans in this manner it was argued sars-cov-2 acquired mutations needed for human transmission and will continue to evolve with novel mutations as the pandemic evolves zhang  holmes 2020 in this scenario it is expected that diverse signatures of viral variants spread among different populations in the world recently thousands of genbank sequences from sars-cov-19 available at the ncbi virus database were trackable by region suggesting that the transmission occurred mainly through clonal events due to clustering of the available sequences chen allot  lu 2020 kupferschmidt 2020 httpswwwncbinlmnihgovlabsvirusvssivirusseqtypesproteinviruslineagesssars-cov-220taxid2697049 as a proof of concept in the early beginning of the outbreak in china sequencing the virus from nine patients from wuhan in china revealed 999 similarity among samples that finding suggests 2019-ncov originated from one source within a very short time supporting clonality of spreading lu et al 2020 in this study we characterized the early mutational events across 50 illumina high-quality datasets publicly available on the sequence read archive repository a total of 30 out of 50 samples 60 contained at least a single founder variant and most of the variants across samples are missense over 63 sars-cov-2 founder variants in wa state usa usa-wa are dissimilar to australian sars-cov-2 founder variants which were found to be heterogeneous however a mutational signature from usa mutations was found in an australian sample suggesting a world-wide spread of this molecular signature consisting of five-point variants remarkably mutations in the helicase and orf1ab proteins of the virus were found more frequently than others suggesting that these regions continue to actively evolve as proof of the latter a single nucleotide polymorphism snp in an australian sample causes a bona-fide stop codon in the helicase protein as genetic drift prompts the mutational spectrum of the virus we recommend frequently sequencing the viral pool in every country to detect the founder events relevant for sars-cov-2 testing in

and ten primer-blast ye et al 2012 designed primers against sars-cov-2 reference genome nc0455122 we aimed to call variants of sars-cov-2 datasets sequenced with the illumina technology due to its depth and sequencing quality in terms of error rate nielsen et al 2011 as of 27 march 2020 we obtained 282 accession numbers for sars-cov-2 from the sequence read archive containing 27 illumina datasets by searching in sequence read archive repository sra we added 24 more datasets yielding in total 51 illumina raw datasets to analyse see table s1 sheets 1 and 2 from this list we excluded the chinese sample ncov5 srr11059943 due to large gaps in genome coverage as explained in shen et al 2020 and we subsequently worked with these illumina datasets we aligned each fastq reads against the sars-cov-2 reference genome nc0455122 corresponding to the initial isolate wuhan-hu-1 we checked coverage of each sample by using the integrative genomics viewer tool robinson et al 2011 and samtools table s1 sheet 2 variant calling in each sample by using strelka2 reveals a diverse number of variants per sample yielding 137 single nucleotide polymorphisms snvs and nine indels see fig 1a table s1 sheet 3 founder variants were obtained by doing variant calling with bcftools after strict filtering see table s1 sheet 2 remarkably thirteen out of fourteen datasets from the usa-wa state study hereafter referred as usa-wa displayed variants presenting a defined variant signature consisting in a core of five founder variants at positions 8782 17747 17858 18060 and 28144 in the sars-cov-2 reference genome also detected within the 137 snvs from the next generation sequencing datasets see fig 1b table s1 sheets 2 and 3 mutational landscape analysis of sars-cov-2 samples in australia australia-vic samples hereafter australia-vic demonstrated that these samples were clearly heterogeneous displaying a variety of founder mutations per sample but also shared variants were observed within samples one variant position 26144 is present in 511 australia-vic samples and variants 8782 and 28144 from usa-wa signature are also present in 311 australian samples see fig 1c table s1 sheet 5 notably one australian-vic sample srr11397717 displayed the same five-point variant signature of usa-wa samples two samples contain the same variant signature presenting one deletion srr11397715 and srr11397716 and one novel signature srr11397728 presents a snp that creates a stop codon see table s1 sheet 5 all of these called variants present mutant allele frequencies near or equal to 100 evidenced in the number of mutantallelesreferencealleles see mutant allele frequency in table s1 sheets 4 and 5 respectively easily visualized in the aligned bam files see fig 1c from usa-wa and fig 1d for australian-vic samples respectively these analyses suggest that these variants were already spread in the infected population in the early days of the outbreak they are not restricted by country and that they will continue to spread along with the growing cases to support the latter as of 22 april 2020 we downloaded 1599 genbank sequences of sars-cov-2 from asia europe and north america origin respectively and we aligned them against the sars-cov-2 reference genome a phylogenetic tree was constructed from all genbank sequences and depict a mixed clustering of sequences between asia europe and north america supporting the existance of different viral signatures fig s1 variant calling from these alignment reveals the substantial presence of usa-wa signature in north america sequences with allele frequencies af ranging 3339 see fig 1e table s1 sheet 6 variants 8782 and 28144 from usa-wa signature are also present in asia and europe suggesting these two variants arises in the beginning of the pandemic and spread worldwide thus the usa-wa signature is likely widespread among sars-cov-2 infections in usa due to founder effect also in north america genbank sequences six more variants were detected with similar allele frequencies as reported for usa-wa variants a summary of the usa-wa mutational signature is depicted in table 1 less founder variants with lower allele frequencies are present in asian samples suggesting high clonality of the original strain of sars-cov-2 conversely in europe 16 founder variants with higher allele frequencies were found supporting sars-cov-2 evolves as the pandemic spread overall missense genbank variants equals or surpasses synonymous variants in orf1ab nucleocapsid n orf3a orf8 and surface glycoprotein s see fig 1f table s1 sheet 7 thus as the pandemic evolves successful molecular adaptations in sars-cov-2 also occurred as is presented in the different viral signatures to see if the latter observations are replicated in next generation sequencing datasets we aimed to characterize in depth usa-wa and australia-vic variants as performed with founder variants from genbank sequences in agreement with the latter classification of variants performed by snippy tool analysis reveals that most variants in usa-wa and australia-vic are preferentially missense 63 for usa-wa samples and 74 for australia-vic samples respectively rather than synonymous see figs 2a and 2b table s1 sheets 4 and 5 respectively focusing on missense variants of usa-wa samples the most recurrent mutations occurred in the polypeptide orf1ab encoding a viral helicase and 35 exonuclease and orf8 protein accounting for the 81 of missense variants in the usa-wa signature see fig 2c table s1 sheet 4 in the case of australia-vic missense variants the scenario is more complex due to the heterogeneity of the signatures mutations in the orf1a polyprotein orf3a protein helicase and surface glycoprotein account for 69 of the missense variants present in the australia-vic signatures see fig 2d importantly two australian samples srr11397715 and srr11397716 present the same mutational profiling with deletions in the stem loop of the virus and notably one sample srr11397728 presents a snp that creates a stop codon in the helicase protein see table s1 sheet 5 since every usa-wa and australia-vic sample that presents variants in the helicase gene contains at least one missense variant this evidence strongly suggests that this gene is located in an actively evolving region from sars-cov-2 and it will likely continue to evolve as the pandemic spreads the centers for disease control and prevention primer list consists of three primer sets designed against the orf9 structural protein nucleocapsid phosphoprotein each one with a fluorescent probe for reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr we investigated if these primers hybridized at positions that fall within the variants reported herein from the 50 next-generation sequencing datasets we aligned these primer sequences with sars-cov-2 reference genome and the 50 analyzed samples we found two australian clonal samples srr11397719 and srr11397721 presenting one founder synonymous snp position 28688 that occurs within the 2019ncovn3forwardprimer hybridization region in the first sample we also found an snp with low allele frequency that falls into the 2019-ncovn1reverseprimer see fig 3 we also challenged a list of primers available from literature primers currently used for the institute pasteur hong kong university and ten primers obtained from primer-blast against merged genbank variants including variants from the next-generation sequencing datasets employed here of these cdc primer set 2019-ncovn3 forward and reverse along with its probe were discarded again due to potential reduced efficiency during priming see table s1 sheet 8 similarly sets 1 2 3 and 8 from primer-blast were discarded conversely primers used by the pasteur institute and hong-kong university passed the filter respectively thus increasing variation in sars-cov-2 can confound quantitative rt-qpcr in the future depending on the primer design in this study we have analyzed early mutational events occurring in sars-cov-2 illumina whole-genome sequencing samples from different populations usa australia and china and we compared these results with variants observed in submitted genbank sequences in ncbi viral portal up until 22 april 2020 as already reported with hiv and chikungunya outbreaks the founder effect of five-point variants was observed in almost all usa-wa samples obtained by next-generation sequencing these mutations also have high allele frequencies around 3339 in sars-cov-2 genbank sequences from usa origin foley et al 2000 tsetsarkin et al 2011 these variant signatures are likely to be overrepresented among washington state infections and usa infections overall if not globally supporting the latter the alignment of 1359 sars-cov-2 submitted sequences to ncbi virus from north america 22 april 2020 shows allele frequencies of 3339 of these five snps across samples worldwide these snps cause missense mutations in helicase 35 exonuclease and orf8 proteins in the case of victoria samples from australia founder variants from one up to eleven snps were found in the early beginning of the outbreak in wuhan city between 18 and 29 december 2019 one to four mutations arose in the virus per patient shen et al 2020 arguing that the number of fixed mutations in the world population is rapidly increasing where the infection has spread importantly one australian sample sequenced by next generation sequencing presented the usa-wa signature suggesting that this signature is already propagated with the worldwide pandemic consistent with the latter real-time tracking of pathogen evolution and phylogenetic analysis provided from the nextstrain initiative demonstrated dissemination of sars-cov-2 viral signatures from usa to australia and europe in early february 2020 hadfield et al 2018 clonal mutational events within australian samples were also observed and probably are widespread in the region one interesting feature from usa-wa signature are missense variants occurring in the helicase gene orf1ab rna helicases display various functions in genome replication they have even been proposed as a therapeutic target to inhibit coronaviruses among other viruses with small molecules briguglio et al 2011 thus mutations evoked by these variants could make drug targeting this protein more difficult in the future also as genetic drift is allowing sars-cov-2 to evolve as the pandemic continues the amplification efficiency of quantitative rt-qpcr tests may be compromised since a single mutational even in the middle of a primer sequence can be detrimental for pcr efficiency bru martin-laurent  philippot 2008 potentially contributing to false negative results in covid-19 testing for this issue we provided a way to compute the latter by merging all variant sites called across studied samples and by intersecting them across primer sets available both in the literature and currently in use in viral testing kits as new mutations can be spread depending on the founder effect we firmly urge that primer sets for clinical testing should be tested in this way continuously according to the current mutations found at the particular time and in the specific population which needs to be diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection we describe here the early mutational events in sars-cov-2 virus by analyzing sequencing samples from china usa australia and genbank sequences submitted between 27 march and 22 april 2020 sars-cov-2 variants from the usa display five-point mutations with clonal founder patterns of spreading at a considerably high frequency among samples the latter was verified by sequence analysis of sars-cov-2 sequences submitted to genbank since these five-point mutations displayed alleles frequencies of 3339 among all usa genbank sars-cov-2 sequences n  1359 sars-cov-2 australian variants were heterogeneous but still clonal events were found including one sample presenting the usa-wa signature implying worldwide spreading of this signature the efficiency of rt-qpcr testing can be potentially affected by founder variants since several snps affecting one of three primers sets currently used in covid-19 testing has been found by the time of this publication the available data could change the conclusions presented in this manuscript as a result of further viral variants arising  analysis of codon usage and nucleotide bias in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus genes snawar hussain pottathil shinu mohammed islam monirul muhammad chohan shahzad sahibzada rasool tasleem   emerging viral diseases are a major threat to public health systems across the globe1 the recent outbreaks of novel coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in china2 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak in arabian peninsula3 and zika virus outbreak in south america have caused significant financial and human losses these outbreaks were caused either by novel viruses or by genetically distinct strains of existing species4-6 interestingly all listed outbreaks were of zoonotic origin caused by animal viruses that jumped species barriers and caused fatal outbreaks in human populations6 zoonosis poses additional challenges because the natural reservoirs are often domestic or wild animals5 therefore control measures such as quarantine vaccination and social distancing are not practical the middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a newly described disease caused by a recently identified human coronavirus7 the mers-cov was first isolated from the sputum of a saudi arabian patient who died from a severe respiratory illness3 since then at least 2494 laboratory-confirmed human cases of mers-cov infection and 858 deaths in 27 countries have been reported8 the primary source of the mers-cov remains unclear but the pattern of transmission and epidemiological studies point toward dromedary camels as a direct source the virus is believed to be introduced into the human population through multiple independent zoonotic transmission events with limited human-to-human transmission910 the mers-cov belongs to the subgenus merbecovirus of the beta-coronaviruses11 other members of this subgenus are tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 pipistrelles bat coronavirus hku5 and hedgehog coronavirus 112 the mers-cov is an enveloped virus containing a large 30 kb plus sense rna genome3 the 5 two-third of the genome comprises two overlapping open reading frames orfs orf1a and orf1ab which are translated to yield two large polyproteins polyprotein 1a pp1a and polyprotein 1ab pp1ab polyprotein 1a is translated from orf1a while production of pp1ab encoded by both orf1a and orf1b requires a 1 ribosomal frameshift before the translation stop codon on orf1a is reached this frameshift has been shown to occur in the overlap region between orfs 1a and orf1b both polyproteins are post-translationally processed by two viral proteases to yield 16 mature proteins necessary for viral rna replication the remaining one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins spikes envelope e matrixm and nucleocapsidn and an unknown number of accessory proteins11 contrary to the replicase proteins which are directly translated from genomic rna the structural and accessory proteins are expressed from a nested set of sub-genomic rnas in addition to coding sequences the coronavirus genome also contains highly structured non-coding regions at the 5 and 3 end of the genome which are believed to play a regulatory role in viral genome replication and protein expression1314 the genetic code is essentially redundant eighteen of the 20 amino acids in prokaryotes are encoded by more than one synonymous codon the use of a synonymous codon is not random during an organisms evolutionary history a bias for a particular synonymous codon will be formed within a species or gene which ensures that the most frequently used codons can pair with the anticodons of the most abundant trna genes1516 since viruses do not encode translational functions and depend exclusively on the host cell machinery to synthesize viral proteins the expression of viral genes is temporally regulated by adjusting the codons usage to match or contrast the host trna resources the expression levels of papillomaviruses capsid proteins l1 and l2 depend on the match between the codon usage and trna availability in the host cells1718 the presence of low prevalence codons in hepatitis a virus genes facilitates the correct folding of hav proteins19 herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus maintain low prevalence codons in their genes2021 considering such intimate dependence codon usage bias analyses can provide useful insights into the adaptation of virus the effect of the host on its codon usage the factors driving the codon usage bias and the regulation of viral gene expression most of the coronavirus genomes have an atypical nucleotide bias which is believed to be the direct cause of the characteristic codon usage in these viruses cytosine deamination and selection of cpg suppressed clones by the immune system are major selective forces that shape codon usage bias in coronavirus genomes22 the nucleotide biases are more pronounced in the unpaired regions of the structured rna genome creating a virus-specific signature that may suggest a certain biological function for these distinctive sequence signatures2324 the codon usage bias analyses of mers-cov plpro and 3clpro proteases indicate a disproportional effect of compositional constraints and directed mutation pressure on codon usage in each protein25 the comparative analysis of human and animal mers-cov isolates suggests that mutational bias is a major determinant of codon usage bias in humancamel isolates whereas natural selection pressure appeared to be the key determinant of codon usage in bathedgehog isolates26 although the mers-cov genome is a mono-partite rna as many as 10 different proteins are expressed from a series of subgenomic mrnas produced during virus infection non-structural proteins are required for early stages of the viral life cycle and the presence of optimal codons may be desired for the rapid accumulation of these proteins in infected cells on the other hand structural proteins are potentially immunogenic and often required for late stages of the virus life cycle therefore the gradual accumulation of these proteins may be beneficial for virus replication without mounting a host immune response the main objective of this study was to determine 1 the nucleotide composition of the genome and its effect on codon usage preferences 2 the intra- and inter-genomic variations in the codon usage among human and camel strains and 3 the forces that influence the evolution of codon usage bias we analyzed 4751 mers-cov genes from 664 complete or partial genomic sequences to determine the extent of codon usage bias and the relative contribution of various evolutionary forces in shaping codon usage the effective number of codons enc value showed a moderate gene-specific codon usage bias in mers-cov genome codon usage bias is mainly shaped by translational selection while mutational pressure emerged as a minor factor in some genes cpg suppression and cytosine deamination along with the physical and chemical properties of encoded proteins are other factors that affect mers-cov codon usage preferences a total of 453 complete genomes and 211 partial sequences of human and camel mers-cov isolates were retrieved from the national center for biotechnology genbank database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov table s1 all the sequences were aligned and curated using mega 70 and orfs with authentic initiation and termination were extracted the final sequence collection of 4751 orfs was used for further analyses general nucleotide composition a c t and g nucleotide composition at third synonymous codon position a3s c3s t3s and g3s and mean frequencies of g  c nucleotide at the first second and third codon positiongc1s gc2s gc3s were calculated using default parameter in sse software package27 the observed o and expectede frequencies of 16 dinucleotides gpa gpc gpg gpt cpa cpc cpg cpt tpa tpc tpg tpt apa apc apg and apt were also calculated using sse software package and the ratio of oe frequencies was used for designation of over- or under-represented dinucleotides2829 the enc is a simple and absolute measure of codon usage bias3031 enc values range from 20 to 60 with lower enc values 40 indicating strong codon usage bias3233 the enc values for mers-cov genes were calculated using the default parameter in sse software package27 the rscu values for each codon were calculated to determine the patterns of synonymous codon usage34 the rscu value for a particular codon is a ratio of observed frequency divided by the expected frequency the codons with rscu values  10 indicate a positive codon usage bias while codons with rscu values  10 indicates a negative codon usage bias the rscu values of 10 indicate that codons are chosen randomly the rscu values of all mers-cov sequences were calculated using mega70 software package35 the amino acids encoded by single codon aug met and tgg trp and the termination codons taa tag and tga were excluded from the analyses it represents the frequency of use of g  c in the synonymously variable third positions of the sense codon ie excluding met trp and termination codons the cai is a measure of the relative adaptiveness of a gene toward its host codon usage36 cai values range from 0 to 1 high cai value indicates a higher proportion of the most abundant codons the cai values for all mers-cov genes were calculated using human and dromedary camel codon usage as reference sets in cai calculator37 the rcdi is a complementary approach to measure codon de-optimization by comparing the similarity in codon usage of a given gene against a reference genome38 the rcdi values for all mers-cov genes were computed for both hosts using a web-based rcdiercdi server available at httpppuigbomeprogramscaical the rcdi value is inversely related to the degree of adaptation to the host an rcdi value of 1 would indicate that the virus follows the codon usage of the host while progressively higher rcdi values indicate an increasing deviation from the host codon usage physical and chemical properties of encoded proteins play an important role in shaping the codon usage of some species3940 hydropathicity values represent the sum of the hydropathy values of all amino acids in the gene product divided by the number of residues in the sequence41 hydropathicity values range from 2 to 2 where positive and negative values are indicative of hydrophobic and hydrophilic proteins respectively aromaticity values represent the frequency of aromatic amino acids trp tyr and phe in the protein42 the cds length represents the number of translatable codons in a gene43 the enc-plot enc vs g3s is commonly used to determine whether the codon usage of a gene is affected by mutation or selection30 the enc-plot is the comparison of the observed and expected distribution of genes based on gc3s on a single plot expected enc values for all gc3s compositions 0-10 were calculated using the equation encexp  2  s  29s2  1  s230 and used to plot standard curve data points located on or just below the standard curve encexp indicate mutational pressure determines the codon usage bias while data points located far away from the standard curve indicate that factors other than mutational pressure are affecting the codon usage bias mutation at the first and second codon positions cause a change in amino acid while mutation at the third codon position often does not alter amino acids theoretically mutations should occur randomly at any of the three codon positions if there is no external pressure the neutrality plot is an analytical method used to investigate the mutation-selection equilibrium in shaping the codon usage bias44 in a neutrality plot average gc contents at the first and second synonymous codon positions gc12 are plotted against gc content at the third synonymous codon gc3s position the regression coefficient against gc3s is regarded as the mutation-selection equilibrium coefficient and the evolutionary speed of the mutation pressure and natural selection pressure is expressed as the slope of a regression line a regression plot with a slope of zero indicates no effect of directional mutation pressure while a slope of 1 is suggestive of complete neutrality correspondence analysis coa is widely used to study the correlation between codon usage and other factors the coa was performed with codonw httpsourceforgenetprojectscodonw utilizing the rscu values to compare the inter-genic variation of 59 synonymous codons major trends within this dataset can be determined using measures of relative inertia and genes were ordered according to their positions along the axis of major inertia pearson rank correlation analysis was performed using microsoft excel and xlstat version 2014503 to deduce the relationships between the two axes of coa and different variables like cai enc gravy aromo and gc3s with a statistical significance at p-values  05 the nucleotide compositions of mers-cov coding sequences were analyzed to explore the potential influence of compositional constraints on codon usage the a 262 and u 326 nucleotide occurred more frequently than c 203 and g 21 nucleotide in mers-cov genome as shown in figure 1a the mean gc and au compositions of mers-cov genome were 4268  314 and 5731  314 respectively the individual mers-cov genes exhibit similar strong compositional bias except n and orf8b genes with 47309  020 and 49283  019 g  c contents respectively the g  c content in the mers-cov coding sequence is not uniformly distributed the g  c at first codon position is highest in all genes however the g  c at second and third codon positions are variable in orf4a e m and orf8b the g  c at second codon position are lowest while in orf1ab s orf3 orf4b orf5 and n gene the g  c at third codon position are lowest figure 1b further analyses of third-position wobble nucleotides revealed a significant abundance of a3s 0309  0053 and u3s 0462  0105 as compared to c3s 0239  0033 and g3s 0195  006 figure s1 highly significant nucleotide compositional bias p  0001 is likely to affect the choice of codon and au is expected to occur most frequently at the third codon position in the mers-cov genes to investigate the extent of codon bias in mers-cov genome the rscu values were computed for every codon in the mers-cov genes table 1 among 59 synonymous codons 27 were defined as preferred codons rscu  10 and 24 of them are au-ending among preferred codon nine codon ucus gcua acut ccup ggug cuul guuv cgur and auui with rscu value of  16 were considered over-represented similarly 11 codons auci cugl cual cggr agcs cgar gggg gcga ucgs acgt and ccgp with rscu value of 06 were regarded as under-represented and 9 out of 11 under-represented codons are gc ending among 18 preferred codons of each amino acid all 18 in orf3 17 in orf1ab and spike 16 in e and n genes 15 in orf4b and orf 5 10 to 12 in m orf4a and orf8b are au ending further analysis of amino acids encoded by four or more synonym codons revealed that approximately 23 of all amino acids in mers-cov proteins are encoded by au-ending codons for example 7983 of proline 7878 of threonine 766 of arginine 7560 of serine 665 of glycine 6389 of valine 6086 of arginine and 57 of leucine are encoded by au ending codons given the dependence of viruses on host translational machinery the codon usage pattern of viruses is likely to be affected by the codon usage pattern of its host45 studies have shown a wide range of variations among different viruses ranging from complete coincidence to complete antagonism and in between45-51 comparative analysis of the rscu values indicate that the codon usage pattern of mers-cov is mostly antagonistic to its hosts with less than five preferred codons orf1ab and s  0 orf3  1 n  3 4e orf4b and orf5  4 and orf4a and m  5 coinciding with the host in different mers-cov genes table 1 a similar mix of codon usage has been reported for several other viruses4952 and may serve best by balancing the translation efficiency and proper folding of viral proteins in infected cells to investigate synonymous codon usage variation among mers-cov genes coa was implemented for all 4751 genes the first principle axis explained 3237 of total variability while the other three principle axes account for 1941 1780 and 1051 of all the variation respectively figure 2a this indicates that the first four axes account for 80 of total variation and are major explanatory axes for interpreting the codon usage variation the coa generated on the rscu of mers-cov coding sequences formed 10 distinct clusters each representing one mers-cov gene figure 2b the data points representing m n orf1ab s orf4b and orf5 were clustered around the axes center whereas the data points representing orf4a e orf 3 and orf8b were located away from axes because the closeness of any two genes on this plot reflects the similarities of their codon usages synonymous codon usage bias appears to be conservative between viruses but significant differences exist in codon usage among various genes several factors such as translational selection mutation pressure and gene function affect the codon usage bias a multivariate correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between relative codon bias and various codon usage indices the enc showed a significant positive correlation with the first and the second principle axes indicating the first and second principle axes are the major contributor to codon bias table s2 axis 1 showed a distinct negative correlation with t at and t3s r  -0565 -0695 and -0688 respectively p  0001 and positive correlation with a g c gc a3s g3s c3s and gc3s r  0257 0558 0497 0695 0218 0577 0154 and 0648 respectively p  0001 axis 2 also showed similar distinct correlations with these nucleotide compositions table s2 moreover when correlation analysis was performed between two principle axes and indices related to natural selection cai laa gravy and aromo a highly significant negative correlation was found between the axis1 and cai laa and aromo r  -0512 r  -0085 and r  -0783 respectively p  0001 the axis 2 positively correlated with cai and aromo  0503 and r  0089 respectively p  0001 while it negatively correlated with gravy and laa r  -0088 and r - 0192 respectively p  0001 p  0001 these data suggest that the codon usage bias in mers-cov genes is affected by both mutational pressure and natural selection although the genomic composition was found to be relatively stable and conserved among different isolates substantial differences in the codon usage among different mers-cov genes were observed the enc values of different mers-cov genes ranged from 3889 to 6048 table 2 the orf3 of mers-cov has a relatively strong codon usage bias 4102  0539 while codon usage in orf4a 57061  1175 m 59874  0332 and e protein 56007  0323 is least biased high enc values 40 and little variation in enc among genes from different isolates suggest a moderate but highly conserved gene-specific codon usage bias in the mers-cov genome to estimate the level of expression of mers-cov proteins in human and animal hosts cai values were calculated for all genes using human and camel dromedary codon usage as references table 2 the mean cai for mers-cov genes ranged from 0667 to 0766 against human codon usage reference and 0537 to 0643 against camel codon usage reference the cai values resulting from the analyses of the 10 coding regions of the mers-cov virus shared by 450 fully sequenced viral genomes showed that genes encoding structural n s and m and replicase polyprotein have highest cai values while most of the accessory proteins have low cai values the envelope orf4a and orf4b were exceptions in both cases to assess the effect of gene expression on codon usage bias we calculated the correlation coefficient between the enc and cai values for each host the cai values for both hosts showed a distinct positive correlation with axis 2r  0503 and 0805 respectively p  0001 and enc r  0096 and 0426 respectively p  0001 but negative correlation with axis1 r  -0512 and -0117 respectively p  0001 these data indicate that codon usage in mers-cov genome is affected by the gene expression level of its host the rcdi provides an insight into the possible co-evolution of virus and host genomes the average rcdi value of 1568  0206 range 131-215 in human and 1805  0275 1466-2452 in camel indicated that mers-cov was more adapted to human host as compared to its animal host table 2 in relation to both hosts strong codon deoptimization was observed in the accessory genes orf3 2071  0019 and 2421  0027 e 1759  001 and 2161  0014 orf5 1655  0013 and 1961  0019 and orf8b 1621  002 and 1743  0019 the structural genes s m n replicase gene orf1ab and accessory gene orf4 were comparatively more adapted to both host and showed low rcdi values to investigate the potential effect of physical and chemical properties of encoded proteins on mers-cov codon usage correlation coefficients between gravy aromo laa enc and nucleotide composition were determined as shown in table s2 gravy value of mers-cov proteins showed significant positive correlation with enc and t and at r  0634 0490 and 0338 respectively p  0001 but negative correlation with principle axis 2 a c and g nucleotides r -0088-0731 -0311-0439 and-0490 respectively p  0001 similarly aromo values also exhibit significant positive correlation with enc t at and axis 2 r  0300 0723 and 0089 respectively p  0001 but negative correlation with a g c gc and axis1 r -0530 -0525 -0631 -0757 and -0783 respectively p  0001 in addition protein length positively correlated with a t g and at 0093 0102 0240 and 0216 respectively p  0001 but negatively correlated with enc c gc axis 1 and axis 2 -0197-0600-0068 -0085 and -0192 respectively p  0001 this result indicates that codon usage variations were associated with the protein length hydropathicity and aromaticity of the encoded proteins comparative analysis of gc content at third wobble position gc3s confirmed the homogeneity of codon usage among the isolates but marked variation among individual genes was observed the mean gc3s value of different mers-cov genes ranged from 022 to 045 similarly despite remarkable inter-genomic homogeneity in codon usage analyses of individual genes revealed significant differences in enc values to elucidate the relationship between nucleotide composition and codon bias in mers-cov genes the enc values of all mers-cov genes were plotted against the corresponding gc3s the solid line in figure 3a represents the expected positions of genes when the codon usage was only determined by the gc3s compositions in figure 3a data points representing mers-cov orf1ab s orf3 orf4b n and orf8b formed distinct clusters below the expected curve with variable proximities suggesting a dominant effect of forces other than mutation pressure on codon usage bias data points corresponding to orf4a e and m genes were aggregated closer to the expected curve with few data point overlapping the curve indicating a stronger influence of mutational pressure in these genes as compared to other genes although the encgc3 plot reflected the main factors that influenced codon usage bias it did not estimate precisely which one of mutation pressure or natural selection was more important to determine the relative contribution of mutation pressure or natural selection on codon usage the correlation among three codon positions gc12vs gc3s was determined when gc3 was plotted against gc12 for all genes no significant correlation was found r  -0026 p  074 suggesting that codon usage is not influenced by the mutational pressure however when gc3 of individual genes were plotted against the corresponding gc12 a significant correlation between gc3 and gc12 was observed for all genes except orf 4b r  0028 p  54 the slope of the individual neutrality plots indicates relative neutralities ranging from 16 to 3552 figure 3b the orf3 had the highest relative neutrality values of 3552 indicating a significant impact of neutral evolution mutational pressure on codon preference in this gene although highly significant correlations between gc3 and gc12 was observed in remaining genes the slopes of regression lines indicate that less than 16 of codon usage bias in these genes is explained by mutational pressure these data suggest that different evolutionary pressures are acting disproportionally on mers-cov genes mutational pressure appeared as a minor factor affecting the codon usage preferences in some mers-cov genes while natural selection emerged as the dominant factor influencing the codon usage in all mers-cov genes significant biases of dinucleotide composition in many rna viruses have been reported which may be a consequence of intrinsic characteristics of the virus or mutational pressure from the host to determine if the dinucleotide composition of mers-cov genome is biased ratios of observed to expected frequencies of 16 dinucleotides were computed for all mers-cov sequences the mean  standard deviation of dinucleotide oe ratios for mers-cov genome is 10  0144 and the dinucleotides located outside the confidence interval mean  1sd 086-114 were classified as low or high relative abundance respectively the dinucleotide bias in mers-cov genome is not acute and only two dinucleotides the cpg and upa were markedly under- and over-represented respectively figure 4a solid line while two other dinucleotides cpa and cpu were marginally over-represented similar dinucleotide biases were observed in individual mers-cov genes figure s2a-l the cpg dinucleotide was under-represented in all mers-cov genes except orf5 while cpaupg were over-represented in most of mers-cov genes in non-coding sequence mild suppression of cpg and gpa oe 0752 and 0762 respectively and slight over-representation of apa cpa gpc and upg oe 1182 1183 1266 and 1256 respectively was observed among the differentially used dinucleotides only cpg depletion was common across 910 mers-cov genes to determine if cpg depletion is due to evolutionary pressures specifically acting on cpg dinucleotide and not due to composition constraint or pressures acting upon constituent nucleotides cpggpc odds ratio were calculated figure 4b high odds ratio would indicate that depletion was due to pressure acting upon constituent nucleotides while low odds ratio would suggest implication of evolutionary pressures specifically acting upon cpg dinucleotide with exception of orf 3 orf5a and envelope genes cpggpc oe 066 070 and 0859 respectively the cpggpc odds ratio for all other mers-cov genes were less than 060 indicating that cpg depletion is not mere consequence of compositional constraints rather it is due to evolutionary pressures specifically acting on cpg dinucleotides to further understand the mechanism of cpg depletion the loss of cpg dinucleotides 1  oecpg and average gain in upg and cpa dinucleotides tpg  1  oecpa  12 were calculated figure 4 c the average loss of cpg in the mers-cov coding region was 0391  0004 and the average gain in upg and cpa dinucleotides was 0201  0003 a strong negative correlation between the depletion of cpg dinucleotide and the gain in tpgcpa dinucleotides r  0483 p  0001 and a weak but significant correlation between the gc and the extent of cpg depletion r  -0084 p  0001 suggested that the observed under-representation of cpg in the mers-cov genome is the combined effect of the nucleotide composition of the genome and the methylation of the cytosine in cpg dinucleotides followed by deamination to investigate the possible effects of cpg depletion on codon usage bias the rscu value of the 8 cpg containing codons cgt cgg cgc cga tcg gcg ccg and acg were analyzed among these 8 cpg containing codons six codon ccg 016 acg 018 tcg 020 gcg 0290 cga 0450 and cgg 048 were markedly suppressed while two codons cgc114 and cgu 180 were over-represented in the mers-cov genome analysis of individual genes also revealed marked suppression of cpg-containing codons in all genes except orf 8b in which four codons acg 003 cgg 000 gcg 0290 cga 000 and cgu 000 were markedly suppressed while four cpg-containing codons ccg 1396 ucg 1336 gcg 1994 and cgc 20978 were over-represented taken together these data suggest that depletion of cpg dinucleotides significantly affected the usage of cpg-containing codons in the mers-cov genome the current analyses revealed that the mers-cov genome lacked strong codon usage bias which is consistent with previously reported data on other coronaviruses265354 weak codon bias has been reported in many rna and dna virus genomes and may serve best by enabling these viruses to maintain efficient replication without competing for limited trna resources55 the mers-cov genome is gc poor with almost 23 of amino acids encoded by au ending codon since the human genome is also at-rich 5856 the biochemical machinery is appropriately enriched for the replication of at-rich extrachromosomal genetic elements57 a viral genome with matching nucleotide composition will be less of a burden and will be more efficient in replication although the coronavirus genome is a monopartite single-stranded rna coronavirus structural and accessory genes are expressed from independent transcription units with different translation efficiencies13 marked differences in codon usage bias among different genes indicate that different mers-cov genes have taken different codon evolution pathways depending on the function of these genes non-structural proteins are required for early stages of the viral life cycle and less restricted codon usage will ensure an abundant supply of these proteins for transcription and replication similarly less restricted codon usage in proteins with potential interferon antagonizing properties58 and anti-apoptotic activity59 and more restricted codon usage in proteins with potential immunogenic60 or translation attenuation properties6162 would likely benefit viral growth and spread natural selection and mutation pressure are two main factors that account for codon usage variation in different organisms3463 the enc plot suggested that codon usage bias in mers-cov was not the sole result of the random accumulation of mutations despite the significant correlation between gc12 and gc3 for most of the genes the slope of the neutrality plot suggests that only a fraction  16 of codon usage bias in these genes is due to mutational pressure translational selection appears to be the major determinant of codon usage in mers-cov like many mammalian rna viruses and retroviruses6465 the cpg dinucleotide is markedly under-represented in the mers-cov coding sequence the precise mechanism that contributes to cpg under-representation in rna viruses is still largely unknown the selection of cpg suppressed clones by host immune system and methylation-deamination are the most likely mechanisms responsible for cpg suppression in rna viruses22 studies of influenza and picornaviruses indicate that the innate immune response might recognize rna-specific cpg motifs such that the suppression of cpg in viruses could assist immune evasion6667 in contrast other studies have suggested that dinucleotide bias in viruses simply reflects background mutation pressure5568 comparative analysis of cpg suppression in coding and non-coding regions of the mers-cov genome indicates significantly lower cpg content in the mers-cov coding region than the non-coding region the loss of cpg dinucleotides by deamination of methylated cytosines within cpg dinucleotides results in a gain of tpg and cpa dinucleotides64 however the increase in upg and cpa dinucleotides in the coding region was not much different than that in the non-coding region this suggests that cpg suppression was not simply a consequence of host methylation capabilities rather it was a combined effect of multiple biochemical and evolutionary pressures specifically acting on cpg dinucleotide22 viruses acquire replicative fitness by controlling the expression of viral proteins some viruses achieve high replicative rates by codon usage optimized genomes while others evade host immune system and attain latency by codon usage de-optimized genomes1965 the mean cai values in 0708  0027 in humans and 0577  0028 in dromedary camels indicate that mers-cov genes are significantly less expressive in dromedary camels as compared to humans similarly the rcdi value of  1568  0206 in humans and 1805  0275 indicate that mers proteins are expressed in latency phases or even that the virus might present a low replication rate in dromedary camels these subtle differences in protein expression among two hosts may explain the clinical manifestation of mers-cov infection the mers-cov infection in humans is often acute with a high mortality rate while clinical symptoms in camels infected with mers-cov are rare and generally mild in summary the current study revealed a highly conserved gene-specific codon usage bias in the mers-cov genome the formation of codon usage bias in the mers-cov genome is affected mainly by natural selection mutational pressure emerged as a minor factor affecting codon usage in some mers-cov genes dinucleotide bias specifically the cpg suppression has significantly limited the use of cg containing codon the depletion of cpg was a combined effect of evolutionary pressures specifically acting on cpg dinucleotide and compositional constraints imposed by the nucleotide composition of the genome other factors that influenced codon usage included the gene length and protein properties the subtle differences in the levels of mers-cov gene expression in humans and dromedary camel and the sharp contrast in the severity of diseases between two hosts warrant further studies to determine the relationship between viral gene expression and severity of the disease several coronavirus proteins have been identified as interferon antagonist69 and by inference optimal expression of these genes is essential for viral pathogenesis taken together these results provided considerable insight into the genome composition and evolution of mers-cov and may provide a theoretical basis for optimizing mers-cov gene expression to study the functional relevance of various mers-cov proteins alternatively with affordable and readily available gene manipulation tools attenuated vaccine strains containing hundreds of silent mutations can be engineered to mitigate the chances of reversal to pathogenic wild type70  analysis of coronavirus temperature-sensitive mutants reveals an interplay between the macrodomain and papain-like protease impacting replication and pathogenesis xufang deng robert mettelman c amornrat obrien john thompson a timothy obrien e susan baker c julie pfeiffer k   coronaviruses covs are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that primarily infect the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract covs can emerge from an animal reservoir such as bats to infect a new species and cause epidemic or pandemic disease with high mortality recent emergence events exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in humans 1 and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov in domestic pigs 2 have demonstrated how devastating these viruses can be within naive populations to date there are no approved antivirals or effective vaccines that protect humans from coronavirus diseases therefore identifying viral factors that contribute to pathogenesis and characterizing novel targets for therapeutic interventions are two important approaches to facilitate the development of effective vaccines and antivirals the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv is widely used as a model system to study coronavirus replication and pathogenesis in mice replication of the virus initiates with the engagement of the spike glycoprotein with a host cell receptor and the release of the positive-sense rna into the cytoplasm of the cell the large 32-kb viral genomic rna is translated to produce two long polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are processed by viral proteases including the papain-like proteases plp1 andor plp2 and the 3c-like protease 3clpro or mpro into 16 nonstructural proteins nsp1-16 fig 1a to generate the viral replication complex the coronaviral nsps sequester host endoplasmic reticulum er to generate convoluted membranes and double-membrane vesicles dmvs which are the sites of viral rna synthesis 3 4 the viral replication complex generates a nested set of double-stranded rna dsrna intermediates to produce copious amounts of mrnas which are then translated to produce the structural spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid and virus-specific accessory proteins the genomic rna and structural proteins assemble in the er-golgi intermediate compartment to generate infectious virus particles that are released from the cell 5 6 cov replication induces profound rearrangement of the host er and generates viral dsrna intermediates processes that can be sensed by the host to activate the innate immune response as a result covs have evolved multiple strategies to counteract and delay activation of these host immune responses and establish an environment amenable to virus replication these strategies include i expressing species-specific accessory proteins as modulators of innate immune responses reviewed in reference 7 ii encoding highly conserved nonstructural proteins that serve as interferon ifn antagonists 810 and iii sequestering viral rna in dmvs 3 4 to prevent detection by host pattern recognition receptors a key component in the assembly of the dmvs is nsp3 11 12 to date eleven distinct nsp3 domains have been identified using either bioinformatic approaches or enzymatic studies fig 1a here we focus on two multifunctional components contained within nsp3 the macrodomain mac and papain-like protease 2 plp2 the region researchers now term the macrodomain was originally identified in the 1990s as a highly conserved domain of unknown function termed the x domain contained within the replicase polyprotein of rubella virus hepatitis e virus hev and coronaviruses 1315 structural and biochemical studies revealed that the x domain exhibited structural similarity to the cellular histone macroh2a and catalyzed measurable adp-ribose-1-phosphatase adrp activity 1618 although the functional significance of this enzymatic activity was unclear using reverse genetics to inactivate the catalytic site of the enzyme researchers found that adrp activity was not essential for cov replication in cultured cells 19 however further studies revealed that an adrp-catalytic mutant virus was attenuated in mice 20 and that adrp activity in sars-cov and human cov-229e mediated resistance to antiviral interferon responses 21 these findings were consistent with an essential role for enzymatic activity in vivo although the target for the adrp activity was still unclear a breakthrough came in 2016 from a study revealing that the macrodomain of hev acts as an adp-ribose hydrolase 22 adp-ribosylation is a known posttranslational modification that regulates cellular activities 23 therefore viral enzymes that reverse this process could interrupt host cell signaling for covs nsp3 macrodomain activity was shown to promote mhv-induced encephalitis 24 and increase virulence during sars-cov infection 25 another highly conserved enzyme contained within nsp3 is plp2 for mhv plp2 is responsible for processing the nsp34 junction using a highly conserved lxggx cleavage site 26 studies using sars-cov revealed that the single papain-like protease encoded on nsp3 termed plpro cleaves all three sites at the amino-terminal end of the polyprotein 27 plpro also functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme dub which is capable of removing polyubiquitin chains from substrates 28 29 structural studies revealed that cov plproplp2s are similar to cellular dubs 30 enzymatic analysis revealed that cov plproplp2s are multifunctional with protease deubiquitinating and deisgylating activities 3033 viral dub activity has been implicated as a modulator of the innate immune response to viral infection 32 34 35 but the targets of the dub activity has not yet been identified thus both the plp2 and macrodomains of nsp3 have been independently identified as contributors to coronavirus virulence in this study we characterized a temperature-sensitive ts mhv mutant virus containing mutations within both the macrodomain and the plp2 domain we investigated the contributions of these mutations to the temperature-sensitive phenotype as well as the resulting effects on viral pathogenesis the results presented here reveal a previously undescribed interplay between the macrodomain and the plp2 domain that impacts replication antagonizes the innate immune response and contributes to viral pathogenesis modulating the macrodomain-plp2 interaction may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention murine coronavirus strain tsnc11 was generated by chemical mutagenesis plaque purified and validated as a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in positive-sense rna synthesis at nonpermissive temperatures 36 complementation analysis indicated that tsnc11 harbors mutations in the open reading frame 1a orf1a region of the replicase polyprotein but the specific mutations were unknown to identify the nucleotide changes in tsnc11 we isolated the genomic rna from the viral supernatant subjected it to deep sequencing and then aligned the reads to the genomic sequence of mhv strain a59 mhv-a59 genbank accession no ay910861 in agreement with the complementation study by schaad et al 36 the sequence analysis revealed seven nonsynonymous substitutions in orf1a of tsnc11 these substitutions resulted in 7 amino acid aa changes two in nsp2 i4v and t543i four in nsp3 and one in nsp10 p23s the four mutations within nsp3 are distributed between the macrodomain k532e and g554d and the plp2 domain d1026n and d1071n fig 1a as noted above previous studies documented the importance of the macrodomain and plp2 domain in virus replication and disease therefore we focused our efforts on evaluating how these substitutions contributed to the ts phenotype the stability of the phenotype and the pathogenesis of the virus in mice to evaluate the contributions of the macrodomain and plp2 domain mutations to the ts phenotype three mutant viruses were generated using the mhv-a59 reverse genetics system 37 the first mutant virus designated macmut contains the macrodomain mutations k532e and g554d the second virus was engineered with the d1026n and d1071n mutations within the plp2 domain and is designated plp2mut the third virus macplp2mut combines the mutations in the macrodomain and the plp2 domain into one virus in addition an isogenic wild-type mhv icwt was used as a control these viruses were recovered plaque purified and propagated in dbt cells at a permissive temperature of 32c deep-sequencing results confirmed the incorporation of the desired nucleotide changes in the rna encoding nsp3 and revealed no additional amino acid changes within the orf1 region first we evaluated the one-step growth curves of all five viruses tsnc11 icwt and the three engineered mutants at permissive 32c and nonpermissive 37 and 40c temperatures as expected icwt replicates to high titer at all three temperatures whereas tsnc11 is impaired at both 37 and 40c as reported by schaad et al 36 fig 1b analysis of the three engineered mutants revealed that the two substitutions in the plp2 domain were not sufficient to confer a temperature-sensitive phenotype since the kinetics of replication mirrored those of the wild-type virus in contrast the macmut virus exhibited reduced virus replication at 40c but was only slightly impaired at 37c the macplp2 mutant virus mirrored the kinetics of tsnc11 with impaired replication at both 37 and 40c implicating the mutations in both the macrodomain and the plp2 domain as contributors to the temperature-sensitive phenotype of tsnc11 we also evaluated the plaque sizes and efficiencies of plating eop of the viruses at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures as expected all viruses replicated to high titers and formed similarly sized plaques at 32c fig 2 upper panel tsnc11 is profoundly temperature sensitive with a low number of plaques detected at the 101 dilution on the plate incubated at the nonpermissive temperature the tsnc11 plaques that were detected at the nonpermissive temperature exhibited a large-plaque phenotype suggesting that these viruses may be revertants we found that the plp2mut virus formed large plaques at 40c which is consistent with the results of the kinetic analysis and indicates that the mutations in the plp2 domain are not sufficient to cause the ts phenotype analysis of the macmut virus revealed a mixed population of small and large plaques at the nonpermissive temperature the majority of which displayed the small-plaque phenotype the macplp2 mutant virus mirrored the plaque size and plating efficiency of tsnc11 we calculated the eop values which represent the ratio of viral titers obtained at 40c and at 32c fig 2b again the plp2mut and icwt viruses had similar titers at both temperatures resulting in an eop of 1 in contrast the macmut virus exhibited titers that were significantly lower at 40c than the titers obtained at 32c eop of 102 these results indicate that the macmut virus but not the plp2mut or icwt viruses has a defect in plaque formation at the nonpermissive temperature taken together these data demonstrate that the mutations in the macrodomain but not those in the plp2 domain are the major determinants of the ts phenotype of tsnc11 in addition these results are consistent with a critical role of the macrodomain in viral replication interestingly we found that the macplp2 mutant virus mirrored the plaque size and low reversion frequency of tsnc11 eop of 105 supporting a role for the plp2 domain as a genetic enhancer of the ts phenotype a genetic enhancer as defined by genetic studies of eukaryotic organisms is a mutation in one gene that intensifies the phenotype caused by a mutation in another gene 38 while generating the macmut virus we noticed that in addition to the majority population having the small-plaque phenotype a subpopulation of large plaques was also present at 40c the large plaques consistently appeared even after several rounds of plaque purification of the small-plaque isolates therefore we sought to determine whether the small plaques were formed by temperature-sensitive viruses while the large plaques were due to revertant viruses to address this question we selectively isolated plaques with different sizes and propagated them at 32c to obtain viral stocks for subsequent analysis fig 3 we found that the small-plaque isolates recapitulated the phenotype of the parental macmut virus small plaques and similar eop values fig 3a in contrast the large-plaque isolates exhibited a phenotype similar to that of icwt sequencing results of pcr amplicons representing the region spanning the macrodomain and the plp2 domain revealed that small-plaque isolates had no additional mutations in either the macrodomain or plp2 in contrast the large-plaque isolates had either a true reversion d554 to g or harbored putative suppressive mutations located within the macrodomain or the adjacent downstream sequence fig 3b among seven large-plaque revertants all maintained the k532e mutation indicating it was not associated with the ts phenotype three isolates had the d554-to-g reversion suggesting that it may be sufficient for the ts phenotype of the macmut virus we found that isolates 4 to 7 maintained the engineered mutations but had also acquired additional potentially suppressive mutations in the downstream region together these results indicate that altering the coding sequence of either the macrodomain or the downstream region is likely sufficient to revert or suppress the ts phenotype caused by the g554d mutation we also evaluated the mac-plp2 region of tsnc11 large-plaque revertant viruses and found that all three isolates had the d554-to-g reversion fig 3c consistent with our findings with the macmut revertants we determined that the macrodomain mutations are the major contributors to the ts phenotype however we noticed that the macmut virus did not completely phenocopy tsnc11 we found that the replication of the macmut virus was defective at 40c but not at 37c in addition the macmut virus exhibited a higher eop value 102 than that of tsnc11 104 fig 2b indicating a relatively high reversion frequency these data imply that mutations outside the macrodomain may enhance the ts phenotype by stabilizing the replication defect thereby preventing reversion to the wild-type phenotype 38 therefore we sought to determine whether the addition of the plp2 mutations observed in tsnc11 could enhance the ts phenotype of the macmut virus and reduce reversion we found that the macplp2mut virus exhibits a severe replication defect at both 37 and 40c fig 1b and replicated only under permissive conditions similar to tsnc11 the macplp2mut and tsnc11 viruses exhibited similar eop values 104 fig 2b of note the low titer of the macplp2mut virus at 40c indicates a low level of reversion to the wild-type phenotype suggesting that the plp2 mutations stabilize the macmut virus taken together these data demonstrate that while the plp2 mutations are not sufficient to cause the ts phenotype they act to enhance the ts phenotype caused by the mutation in the macrodomain enhancement of phenotypes has been described for other coronavirus interacting proteins 39 40 which motivated us to determine whether the enhancement phenotype we detected here is due to an interaction between the macro and plp2 domains the structures of several domains of nsp3 have been solved individually reviewed in reference 41 or in combination 42 however owing to the size and complexity of this protein the complete structure of nsp3 remains unsolved the capacity of the plp2 mutations to enhance the ts phenotype in the presence of the macrodomain mutations raises the possibility of domain-domain interaction between the macrodomain and plp2 to test this hypothesis we generated plasmids that express either an epitope-tagged macrodomain ha-mac or plp2 domain plp2-v5 depicted in fig 4a when these plasmids were cotransfected into hek-293t cells expression of both the macrodomain and plp2 was detectable by the cognate epitope antibodies fig 4b we detected ha-mac in lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-v5 and inversely plp2-v5 was detected when ha-mac was immunoprecipitated from the lysates these results indicate that the ectopically expressed macrodomain associates with plp2 in cell lysates consistent with either a direct or indirect interaction because we found that mutation in the macrodomain g554d is the major ts determinant and the plp2 mutations enhance the ts phenotype we reasoned that these mutations might alter protein folding thereby rendering the protein unstable and susceptible to proteasome-mediated degradation to determine whether the mutations in the macrodomain andor the plp2 domain alter protein stability plasmid dna expressing wild-type or mutant forms of macplp2 polypeptide fig 5a were transfected into hek-293t cells the cells were maintained at 37c throughout the experiment we added cycloheximide chx at 16 h posttransfection to block translation and harvested cell lysates at the indicated times the level of expressed proteins was determined by immunoblotting fig 5b and c the macplp2 wt protein was maintained at levels comparable to those prior to treatment up to 5 h posttreatment with chx in contrast we detected rapid reductions in the levels of all of the mutant forms of the protein addition of the proteasome inhibitor mg132 blocked degradation of the proteins fig 5b and c these results indicate that mutations in both the mac and plp2 domains affect protein folding and stability rendering the proteins more susceptible to proteasome-mediated degradation to determine whether these macplp2 mutations affect the stability of the replicase proteins during virus replication at the nonpermissive temperature we performed temperature shift experiments as outlined in fig 6 we infected cells with either wt or macplp2mut virus and incubated them at the permissive temperature for 95 h at this point we added chx to block translation and shifted the infected cells to the nonpermissive temperature cell lysates were collected every 30 min and evaluated using immunoblotting for the levels of nonstructural intermediate nsp2-3 and product nsp3 we found that wt nsp2-3 and nsp3 were relatively stable with loss of detection occurring at 3 h after the temperature shift and the addition of chx fig 6c lanes 2 to 8 in contrast the levels of nsp2-3 and nsp3 in the macplp2mut-infected cells diminished more rapidly with reduced levels at 15 h after the temperature shift and the addition of chx fig 6c lanes 9 to 15 these results support the finding that the mac and plp2 mutations destabilize the replicase protein at the nonpermissive temperature previous studies have shown that the papain-like protease domains of mhv sars-cov and mers-cov antagonize the ifn response likely through the deubiquitinating activity of these enzymes 32 34 35 4346 in addition coronaviral macrodomains have been shown to suppress ifn production both in vitro and in vivo 20 21 24 25 we sought to determine whether the mutations in the macrodomain and plp2 modulate the type i interferon response during infection of macrophages as shown in fig 7a infection of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages bmdms with mutant viruses at the permissive temperature produced significantly more ifn- during infection than icwt virus infection at 12 h postinfection the macmut virus induced 2-fold more ifn- than icwt virus furthermore the level of n gene transcripts which reveals the abundances of all viral mrnas was reduced in the macmut-infected cells compared to that for the wild-type virus we found that the plp2mut virus elicited dramatically more ifn- than wt virus while the level of n gene expression was similar the macplp2mut virus exhibited the most robust ifn- response and the lowest level of n gene expression these results show that mutations in the macrodomain and the plp2 domain result in elevated levels of type i ifn mrna expression during infection of macrophages further supporting the role of the macrodomain and plp2 in modulating host innate immunity because the ts mutant viruses had reduced replication efficiency and elicited type i ifn production during infection of macrophages we were interested in evaluating the pathogenicity of these viruses to this end c57bl6 mice were intracranially inoculated with 600 pfu of virus and monitored for weight loss and mortality as shown in fig 7b all wt virus-infected mice lost weight rapidly and succumbed to infection by day 11 postinfection in contrast the mutant virus-infected mice exhibited transient or no weight loss during the infection period and all mice survived these results demonstrate that the ts mutant viruses are attenuated in vivo and those mutations adjacent to the catalytic sites of the macrodomains and plp2 domains can modulate viral pathogenesis identifying viral factors that modulate the immune response to viral infection provides new opportunities for developing novel antiviral interventions here we described an unanticipated interplay between two previously characterized virulence factors the macrodomain and the papain-like protease of coronaviruses the enzymatic activities of these domains have been implicated in removing posttranslational modifications macrodomains remove mono- or poly-adp-ribose from proteins 18 22 23 and the deubiquitinating activity of viral papain-like proteases removes mono- or polyubiquitin chains from signaling proteins 30 32 47 our study stems from characterizing a temperature-sensitive mutant virus that harbored mutations within both the macrodomain and the plp2 domain of nsp3 we found that the mutation within the macrodomain g554d was associated with the most significant temperature-sensitive phenotype but that this alteration of the macrodomain reverted to the wild-type phenotype at high frequency however viruses containing mutations in both the macrodomain and the plp2 domain reverted less frequently consistent with the plp2 domain having an enhancing effect on the ts phenotype although these two enzymes reside within the same nsp3 polypeptide fig 1a to our knowledge this is the first suggestion of an interplay between these domains by expressing the macrodomain and papain-like protease 2 domain on independent expression plasmids we were able to evaluate and detect coimmunoprecipitation of the proteins which is consistent with either a direct or an indirect interaction furthermore we report that the mutations identified in the macrodomain and plp2 domain destabilize the proteins as revealed by proteasome-dependent degradation lastly we demonstrated that these mutant viruses promote type i ifn production from macrophages in tissue culture and are attenuated in mice this study confirms and extends previous studies that independently identified the macrodomain and the papain-like protease 2 domain as modulators of the innate immune response and virulence factors reviewed in references 31 35 48 and 49 macrodomains have been shown to play a role in the virulence of positive-sense rna viruses including hev alphaviruses and coronaviruses reviewed in references 48 and 49 studies of the alphavirus chikungunya virus chikv revealed that the macrodomain at the n terminus of nsp3 hydrolyzes adp-ribose groups from monoribosylated proteins and that this deribosylating activity is critical for chikv replication in vertebrate and insect cells and for virulence in mice 50 interestingly viruses engineered to encode a mutation of the chikv macrodomain catalytic site rapidly reverted to the wild-type sequence 51 similar to the high-frequency reversion we reported for the mhv macmut virus fig 3 studies of the role of the macrodomain during coronavirus replication indicate that catalytic activity is not required for virus replication in interferon-nonresponsive cell lines 19 20 24 however catalytic activity is important for replication in primary cells and in mice implicating the macrodomain in evading the innate immune response and promoting viral pathogenesis 20 24 25 identifying the ribosylated substrates that are targeted by the viral enzymatic activity is an important future direction for this work our study implicated an adjacent viral domain the papain-like protein 2 domain as an interacting partner with the macrodomain interestingly the helicase domain adjacent to the macrodomain of hev was found to modulate macrodomain activity biochemical assays revealed that the presence of the hev helicase domain in cis enhanced the binding of the macrodomain to adp-ribose and stimulated the hydrolase activity 22 furthermore we previously found that mutations in the ubl2 domain could cause a ts phenotype and destabilize the plp2 domain 52 here we found that the mutations in the macrodomain and plp2 domain destabilized the replicase proteins as shown by the more rapid degradation of the proteins after temperature shift we speculate that there may be a dynamic interaction between adjacent domains within the nsp3 polyproteins as a multidomain protein nsp3 must hold a sophisticated architecture to function properly and precisely to date four essential functions have been documented for this multidomain protein i interaction of the ubl1 domain with the nucleocapsid n protein which is important for genomic rna synthesis and encapsidation 39 40 ii proteolytic processing of the n-terminal region of pp1a and pp1ab to release nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 26 27 iii hijacking of the cellular reticular network in concert with other membrane-associated proteins nsp4 and nsp6 to form virus-specific membrane structures for rna synthesis 11 12 and iv antagonizing of the innate immune response through the actions of the de-adp-ribosylating activity of the macrodomain and the deubiquitinating activity of the plp2 domain reviewed in references 31 and 48 the removal of posttranslational modifications such as adp-ribosylation and polyubiquitination could be directed at cellular proteins either to redirect them for use during viral replication or to subvert signaling of innate immune responses ultimately structural and biochemical studies will be needed to fully investigate the multiple cis and trans interactions of nsp3 and to determine whether there is a dynamic interplay that modulates the stability substrate specificity andor affinity of the enzymes and substrates we found that the macplp2mut virus recapitulated the ts phenotype of tsnc11 fig 1b however it is possible that some or all of the other mutations we identified by deep sequencing i4v and t543i in nsp2 and p23s in nsp10 may contribute in a subtle way to the phenotype of tsnc11 nsp2 was shown to be dispensable for mhv and sars-cov replication but deletion of the nsp2-coding sequence resulted in decreased viral replication and rna synthesis 53 for nsp10 previous studies revealed that this protein plays critical roles in 3c-like-protease-mediated polyprotein processing and viral rna synthesis 54 55 the results from these studies indicate that the mutations in nsp2 and nsp10 may also contribute to a ts phenotype while our study focuses on the contribution of the macrodomain and plp2 further studies are needed to fully evaluate the impact of other orf1a mutations on the replication and pathogenesis of coronaviruses in summary we report what is to our knowledge the first indication of an interplay between the macrodomain and papain-like protease 2 domain of cov nsp3 we found that this interplay impacts virus replication efficiency innate immune antagonism and virulence in mice a detailed understanding of the relationship between the macrodomain and the plp2 domain will require further structural and enzymatic studies we anticipate that the genetic analysis coimmunoprecipitation and in vivo pathogenesis outcomes reported here will facilitate these future studies human embryonic kidney 293t hek-293t cells crl-11268 atcc were cultured in dulbecco modified

analysis on the first 12 kb of the replicase gene since previous studies reported the ts phenotype was associated with changes in this region 36 57 all infectious clones were generated using the reverse genetics system previously established for mhv-a59 37 mutations identified by deep sequencing within the macrodomain and plp2 domain were introduced into plasmids a and b respectively and then

bhk-mhvr cells which were overlaid onto dbt cells in a t-75 flask these cells were incubated at the permissive temperature of 32c to facilitate the replication of ts mutant viruses supernatants were collected at the time when cytopathic effect was evident usually between 36 and 48 h postelectroporation all infectious clone mutant viruses were plaque purified propagated on dbt cells and subjected to full genome sequencing to validate the genotype these infectious clones were designated macmut plp2mut and macplp2 according to the locations of introduced mutations as shown in fig 1 to determine

supernatants were collected at the indicated time points and titrated on dbt cells incubated at 32c for 60 h to isolate ts revertants plaque assays were performed at 40c viruses from single plaques were isolated and propagated in dbt cells at 32c to obtain viral stocks to determine the ts phenotype of the isolates the isolates were titrated at both 32 and 40c and eop values were calculated as

when weight loss was 25 according to the protocol statistical analysis of the survival rate was evaluated using the log-rank test  a combination of mutations in the s1 part of the spike glycoprotein gene of coronavirus mhv-a59 abolishes demyelination li fu donna gonzales m jayasri das sarma ehud lavi  the a59 strain of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv produces acute hepatitis meningoencephalitis and chronic demyelination the authors have previously shown that the spike s glycoprotein gene of mhv contains determinants of virulence hepatitis and demyelination they then identified viruses containing mutations in the s gene that exhibit alterations in viral pathogenesis in the present study the authors produced new recombinant viruses with each one of these s gene mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and targeted recombination and studied the effect of each individual mutation on the pathogenesis of the virus they identified a combination of mutations in the s1 gene i375m and l652i that abolishes demyelination individual mutation and other combinations of mutations in the s gene only interfere with virulence and hepatitis and only reduce demyelination i375m but do not abolish demyelination completely thus demyelination determinants exist within genomic regions on both sides of the hypervariable region downstream from the receptor-binding domain in the s1 part of the mhv spike glycoprotein gene the structure and precise function of these regions awaits further investigation journal of neurovirology 2004 10 41-51  mouse hepatitis virus mhv is a member of the coronavirus genus which belongs to the coronaviridae family of the nidovirales order cavanagh 1997 lai and cavanagh 1997  nidoviruses pro-duce a variety of hepatic enteric and neurologic diseases in animals and upper respiratory and enteric diseases in humans lai and cavanagh 1997 lavi et al 1999 lavi and weiss 1989  infection of mhv-a59 in 4-week-old c57bl6 b6 mice produces a biphasic disease with acute hepatitis and meningoencephalitis followed by chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease lavi et al 1984 lavi et al  1986  mhv infection in mice with both a59 and jhm strains serves as an excellent laboratory model for virus-induced demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis ms in humans houtman and fleming 1996 knobler et al 1981 lavi et al 1984b perlman et al 1990 sorensen et al 1984 wege et al 1982 weiner 1973  because viral infection is considered as a potential trigger for demyelination in ms allen and brankin 1993  understanding the mechanism of mhv-induced demyelination and the upstream events that lead to the autoimmune phenomenon may provide important insight into the mechanism of interaction between viruses and the nervous system especially with respect to to understand the molecular basis of mhv neurotropism we investigated a strain of mhv mhv-2 that is closely related to mhv-a59 but is only weakly neurotropic hirano et al 1974 hirano et al  1981 wege et al 1981 yamada et al 1997 yokomori et al 1991  we sequenced the entire genome of mhv-2 and studied its detailed pathologic properties das sarma et al 2001b  we found that mhv-2 produces acute hepatitis and meningitis without encephalitis without demyelination and without persistence of virus in the central nervous system cns das sarma et al 2001b  we then replaced the s gene of a59 with that of mhv-2 by targeted recombination and produced recombinant viruses that have a persistence-positive demyelination-negative phenotype we concluded that demyelination determinants independent of viral persistence map to the s gene of mhv das sarma et al 2000  additional studies identified molecular determinants of pathogenesis in the s gene of mhv leparc-goffart et al 1998 navas et al 2001 phillips et al 1999 phillips et al  2001  to further explore which parts of the s gene are directly responsible for the demyelinating phenotype we studied a set of recombinant viruses that were produced by infection with both mhv-2 and la-7 a temperature-sensitive ts mutant of mhv-a59 keck et al 1988  these recombinant viruses were all found to be nondemyelinating sequencing the s genes of these recombinant viruses revealed that the recombinants s gene was either derived from mhv-2 or from mhv-a59 all the recombinant viruses with an s gene derived from mhv-a59 had three identical amino acid substitutions within the s gene das sarma et al 2001a  because these recombinant viruses were produced by dual infection of cultures with mhv-2 and la-7 we could not rule out that they also contained other mutations in addition to the mutations in the s gene we therefore used site-directed mutagenesis and targeted recombination to produce new recombinant viruses with selective s gene mutations that were associated with the demyelinationnegative phenotype we have previously identified three amino acid substitutions in the s gene  figure 1  that are potentially associated with demyelination i375m l652i and t1087n by using the site-directed mutagenesis kit see materials and methods we mutated three different sites individually or jointly targeted recombination was carried out between synthetic rnas transcribed from recombinant vectors and recipient virus alb4 penn99-1 2 or fmhv all other recombinants according to previously described methods peng et al 1995 das sarma et al 2000  alb4 is thermolabile and displays small plaque morphology at 39  c thus putative recombinants were selected as large plaque viruses after treatment for 24 h at 40  c and plating on l2 cell at 39  c the use of the virus with feline spike protein fmhv also provided a coronavirus s gene demyelination determinants l fu et al 43 useful method to select recombinant viruses against the background of parental viruses because fmhv does not grow in mouse cells the recombination process with the transfected plasmid could be achieved in feline cells fcwf recombinant viruses with s genes derived from mutated mouse s gene regained the ability to grow in mouse 17cl-1 cells by switching from feline cells to mouse cells that did not support the growth of parental fmhv we were able to select the recombinant viruses because only recombinant viruses with a mouse s gene were present in these cultures the potential recombinants were plaque purified twice and screened by using polymerase chain reaction pcr sequencing to detect the expected mutations made in the s gene to verify that no secondary site mutations had been introduced into the s gene we sequenced the entire s gene of the new recombinant viruses we analyzed the ability of the new recombinant viruses to grow in l2 cells by growth-curve kinetics analysis and compared it with the mhv-a59 kinetics we also performed growth analysis of the new viruses in different temperatures 33  c 37  c 39  c to rule out a ts phenotype the growth kinetics of the viruses at 37  c is shown in figure 2  it demonstrates that all viruses have similar growth properties in addition none of the viruses was ts we analyzed the virulence and pathologic properties of the new recombinant viruses and compared it to that of wtmhv-a59 and the control recombinant virus wtr-a59 the virulence of the viruses is shown in table 1  the t1087n mutation in s2 reduced viral virulence by fivefold however all other individual and combination of mutations in the s1 gene reduced  reduced virulence correlated with reduction in the amount of hepatitis mostly seen in the viruses that had mutations in the s1 gene the effect of the three mutations on the pathologic picture of encephalitis and hepatitis is shown in figures 3 and 4  generally none of the mutations or combination of mutations affected the extent of encephalitis hepatitis was abolished in all the viruses that contained the i375m mutation individually or with l652i penn01-1 2 penn2k-3 4 and penn2k-1 2 hepatitis was reduced in penn01-3 4 l652i individual mutation but interestingly hepatitis was not significantly changed in combinations of the t1087n mutation with each one of the other s1 mutations penn01-5 6 and penn01-7 8 the effect of the three mutations on viral replication in the infected organs brain and liver is shown in figure 5  viral titers in the brain and liver were consistent with the pathologic picture because viruses were injected into the brain the brain titers on day 1 generally represent residual injected virus the effect of the three mutations on demyelination is shown in table 2  demyelination was not affected by the reduced virulence and most nonlethal viruses were still able to cause demyelination only viruses containing both i375m and l652i mutations in the s1 gene were nondemyelinating therefore the two combinations that abolished demyelination were the one that included the i375m and l652i mutations penn2k-3 and penn2k-4 and the one that included all three mutations i375m l652i and t1087n penn2k-1 and penn2k-2 neither one of these individual mutations was able to abolish demyelination completely the i375m individual mutation and the combination of l652i and t1087n partially reduced demyelination especially at the lower doses of viral injections interestingly the combination of i375m and t1087n mutations did not reduce demyelination at the same level as the individual i375m mutation viral rna persistence of all recombinant and parental viruses in mouse organs brain spinal cord and liver was analyzed by reverse transcriptase l fu et al figure 3 pathologic analysis of recombinant viruses during acute infection mice were injected ic with 1000 pfu per mouse with each virus only one recombinant virus from each set of duplicate viruses is shown however similar findings were found for both viruses each time point represents the pathologic analysis of two to three mice dark bars represent encephalitis whereas white bars represent hepatitis the intensity of the pathologic damage of encephalitis was based on a 3-level scale 0  no inflammatory infiltrates in the brain 1  focal inflammatory infiltrate 2  multifocal inflammatory infiltrates 3  diffuse inflammatory infiltrates in the entire brain panencephalitis the intensity of the hepatitis was evaluated based on a 4-level scale 0  no hepatitis 1  one to two foci of necrosis in each section of liver 2  three to six necrotic foci in each liver section 3  more than six foci of nonbridging necrosis in each liver section 4  diffuse bridging necrosis of the liver with islands of preserved parenchyma rt-pcr the results of rna persistence in the spinal cord are shown in figure 6  both mhv-a59 and recombinant virus wtr-a59 showed a prominent band consistent with mhv rna similar bands were detected following infections with penn99-1 penn01-1 penn01-3 and penn01-5 all of which are demyelinating viruses the demyelinatingnegative virus penn2k-1 showed no rna persistence in the cord however the other demyelinatingnegative virus penn2k-3 showed a band similar to demyelinating-positive viruses the demyelinationpositive virus penn01-7 showed a weaker positive band thus although some degree of rna persistence may be required for demyelination the presence of persistence is insufficient for the development of demyelination rna persistence in the brain was similar to the spinal cords but with a slightly weaker signal rna persistence in the liver was minimal and was only detected in mhv-a59 and wtr-a59 infections data not shown mice were injected ic with 1000 pfu per mouse with each virus each time point represents the mean titer analysis of two to three mice data present log10 pfuml of wv organ homogenates only one recombinant virus from each set of duplicate viruses is shown however similar findings were found for both viruses samples of liver and brain from infected mice at different time points post infection were tested by plaque assay on l2 cells the mhv genome is the largest among rna viruses although the generation of an infectious mhv clone has been recently reported yount et al 2002  the new construct appears to be attenuated in vivo thus molecular pathogenesis studies continue to require a complex manipulation of the mhv genome in order to introduce targeted changes into specific locations to date the best technique available for this purpose is targeted 3 end heterologous recombination originally introduced by paul masters peng et al 1995  we used this technique in our previous studies in which we identified the demyelination determinants in the s gene das sarma et al 2000  we continued our investigation in the present study to better define the regions of genomic control of demyelination within the s gene although incidental mutations during coronavirus replication are not uncommon we used strict precautions to reduce the chance that incidental mutations might interfere with molecular pathogenesis studies we sequenced the entire s gene of each new recombinant virus immediately before it was used in pathogenesis studies to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and to exclude the possibility of incidental undesired mutations the pathogenesis of new recombinant viruses was tested immediately after the generation of the viruses to avoid unnecessary passages of the viruses in culture which tend to increase the chance for mutations we generated two identical recombinant viruses for each mutation in two independent recombination procedures both viruses were tested in mice to ensure an identical in vivo phenotype these precautions reduced the chance for incidental mutations to a negligible level using these principles we found that a combination of mutations in the s1 gene abolishes demyelination only when introduced simultaneously the i375m mutation which appears to be the dominant and the more important one reduces the amount of demyelination but does not abolish it completely however i375m in combination with l652i completely abolishes demyelination thus although this may not be the only genomic site that controls demyelination the region in the s1 gene downstream from the receptor-binding domain contains important determinants of demyelination figure 1  the coronavirus spike protein is a type i membrane protein with approximately a 1300-residue ectodomain an 18-residue transmembrane portion and a 38-residue cytoplasmic tail schmidt et al 1987  the full-length spike glycoprotein oligomerizes rapidly after synthesis and then cleaves by a furin-like protease into two similar-sized fragments a peripheral s1 and a membrane-anchored s2 sturman et al 1985  s1 and s2 are associated by noncovalent interactions s1 is responsible for binding to cellular receptors whereas s2 has the primary responsibility for membrane fusion the receptors for mhv are members of the family of carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules ceacam of the immunoglobulin superfamily dveksler et al 1991 dveksler et al  1993a dveksler et al  1993b  dimers of s1 bind to a single molecule of ceacam the binding sites on s1 are presumably juxtaposed causing a steric hindrance or global conformational changes that preclude additional interactions lewicki and gallagher 2002  after binding to receptor the spike protein undergoes conformational changes including alternative disulfide linkages and separation of s1 from s2 which may increase the propensity of s to fuse membranes taguchi and matsuyama 2002  we hypothesize that the i375m and l652i mutations mark potential s1 genomic sites that control demyelination these mutations are in the middle of two regions of yet undesignated name or function on either side of the hypervariable region of s1 as shown in figure 1  we provisionally labeled these regions as s demyelination region 1 sdr1 and s demyelination region 2 sdr2 there are no known t-or b-cell epitopes in these regions however these s1 regions may influence spike protein functions in several ways binding of s1 to receptor is unlikely to be significantly affected by sites outside the first 330 amino acids because the ceacam binding site can exist wholly in the amino terminal 330 residues of s1 however sdr1 and sdr2 may still have influence on s1-ceacam binding kinetics which may affect pathogenesis similarly the sdr1 and sdr2 regions may alter the kinetics andor extent of the fusion activity of the spike protein or the kinetics andor extent of separation of s1 from s2 either one of these changes may have an effect on the pathogenesis of the virus the fact that two mutations are necessary for the abolishment of demyelination may rely on the three-dimensional spatial structure and folding of the s1 part of the molecule and on potential chemical interactions between the two sites both i375m and l652i mutations also reduce hepatitis and therefore reduce the overall virulence of the viruses resulting in a nonlethal phenotype however the reduced virulence per se is not enough to abolish demyelination we have shown here and in a previous publications das sarma et al 2000 sarma et al  2001a sarma et al  2001b that viruses that lack the ability to produce demyelination can be either less virulent penn2k-1 and penn2k-2 or significantly more vir-ulent penn98-1 and penn98-2 and mhv-2 than mhv-a59 moreover the individual l652i mutation has a nonlethal phenotype but no effect on demyelination in addition ability of the virus to produce encephalitis may be a prerequisite but is insufficient for the development of subsequent demyelination for example penn2k-3 and penn2k-4 produce encephalitis similar to demyelinating viruses but do not produce demyelination this study therefore provides further evidence that the ability of a virus to produce chronic demyelination is not in direct correlation with the virulence of the virus similarly viral persistence may be a prerequisite but is insufficient for the development of demyelination the property of demyelination is therefore a unique additional neurotropic property which appears to be at least in part encoded by the s1 gene of the mhv genome the following plaque-purified viruses were used in this study mhv-a59 budzilowicz et al 1985 lavi et al 1984a lavi et al  1984b  alb4 obtained from paul masters albany ny and fmhv kuo et al 2000 obtained from paul masters albany ny stock viruses had titers of 10 7 to 10 8 pfuml viruses were propagated and titered on murine l2 cells 17cl-1 cells and feline fcwf cells in dulbeccos minimum essential medium dmem with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs the pmh54 plasmid obtained from paul masters contains the 11-kb 3 end of mhv-a59 genome from the he gene downstream das sarma et al 2000 kuo et al 2000  the sequence of the s gene in pmh54 is identical to that of mhv-a59 except for the introduction of avrii and sbfi restriction sites which allowed the insertion of different s genes into the background of pmh54 and enabled the identification of recombinant viruses containing full length recombinant s gene site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed using the stratagene quickchange kit cedar creek tx targeted rna recombinations were carried out between alb4 for penn99-1 2 fmhv for all other recombinant viruses and synthetic rnas alb4 is thermolabile and displays small plaque morphology at 39  c fmhv contains an s gene from fipv on an mhv-a59 background kuo et al 2000 and can only grow in feline cells fcwf the synthetic rnas were supplied by the pmh54 plasmid containing the entire 3 end of the mhv genome from gene 2 he to 7 n for recombination l2 cells spinner culture for penn99-1 2 only or fcwf all other recombinants coronavirus s gene demyelination determinants l fu et al 49 was harvested and infected at multiplicity of infection moi  1 of alb4 at 33  c or fmhv at 37  c respectively cells were then transfected by electroporation with the synthetic rna by using two consecutive pulses from bio-rad gene pulser apparatus set at 03 kv and 960 f infected and transfected cells were plated onto a monolayer of 17cl-1 cells and the released viruses were harvested at approximately 24 to 48 h post infection for selection of the recombinant viruses a two-step plaque purification was performed and pcr sequencing of the s gene was used to confirm the presence of the desired mutations for each mutation we produced two identical viruses in two independent recombination events this strategy was designed to reduce the possibility that random unrecognized mutations would affect the phenotype the new recombinant viruses were designated as the following also in table 1  1 penn2k1 and penn2k2 contain an mhv-a59 s gene with the i375m l652i and t1087n 3-point mutations 2 penn2k3 and penn2k4 contain an mhv-a59 s gene with the i375m and l652i 2-point mutations 3 penn99-1 and penn99-2 contain an mhv-a59 s gene with the t1087n single-point mutation das sarma et al 2001c  4 penn01-1 and penn01-2 contain an mhv-a59 s gene with the i375m single-point mutation 5 penn01-3 and penn01-4 contain an mhv-a59 s gene with the l652i single-point mutation 6 penn01-5 and penn01-6 contain an mhv-a59 s gene with the i375m and t1087n two-point mutations 7 penn01-7 and penn01-8 contain an mhv-a59 s gene with the l652i and t1087n 2-point mutations finally a control virus wtr-a59 was generated by targeted recombination in which the s gene of mhv-a59 was recombined back into the mhv-a59 background to eliminate the possibility that any changes in pathogenesis might derive from the recombination process itself for sequencing of the s gene rt-pcr was carried out on templates of cytoplasmic rna extracted from virus-infected l2 cells double-stranded pcr products were analyzed by automated sequencing using the taq dye terminator procedure with previously described primers according to the manufacturers protocol das sarma et al 2000  2001a  2001b  mice c57bl6 were infected intracerebrally with 1000 pfu of each of the recombinant viruses along with same dose mhv-a59 and wtr-a59 two mice per virus were analyzed independently 30 days post infection briefly mice were sacrificed and perfused intracardially with 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline pbs liver brain and spinal cord were removed cleaned with pbs then snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen tissue rna was isolated with rneasy mini kit qiagen after quantification 1 g of each rna sample was re-verse transcribed with superscript rt-pcr system invitrogen to synthesis first strand cdna pcr was performed with the oligonucleotide primers izj5 5 -gctccaacagttggtgcc-3  and izj6 5 -acgtaggaccttgctaacttc-3  the primers izj5 and izj6 were designed to detect the most conserved region of mhv-a59 n gene and the 3 untranslated region a 601-bp pcr product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis viral growth curves l2 cell cultures were prepared in 12-well plates in dmem with 10 fbs confluent monolayers were infected with each virus moi  1 in duplicate wells and incubated for 1 h at 37  c after adsorption the cells were washed with pbs three times and then fed with 15 ml medium at the indicated times the cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing and the supernatants were removed and titered by plaque assay on l2 cells as previously described lavi et al 1984b  all animal experiments used 4-week-old virus-free c57bl6 mice nci bethesda md mice were anesthetized with methofane the amount of virus inoculated by in each experiment was diluted in pbs containing 075 bovine serum albumin bsa and a total volume of 25 l was injected into the left cerebral hemisphere ic virulence assays ld50 dose were performed as previously described by ic inoculation of 10 mice per dilution with 10-fold serial dilutions of wild-type or recombinant viruses lavi et al 1984b  mice were examined for signs of disease or death on a daily basis for up to 30 days post infection for organ analysis mice were sacrificed at various time points post infection after perfusion with pbs brains and livers were removed half of the brain and a portion of liver were fixed in 10 buffered formalin paraffin-embedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin he for a blinded histologic analysis samples of brain and liver were frozen in 80  c to be used later for assessment of viral titers by plaque assays for assessment of demyelination mice were sacrificed at 30 days post infection mice were perfused with pbs followed by 10 buffered formalin spinal cords were removed formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded four to six transverse sections of cervical thoracic and lumbar levels of the cord were stained with luxol fast blue lfb and the number of quadrants of cord containing demyelination were counted as a fraction of the total number of cord quadrants evaluated in each individual mouse lavi et al 1984b lavi et al  1986 lavi et al  1988 lavi et al  1990   molecular evolution and emergence of avian gammacoronaviruses mark jackwood w david hall andreas handel   the majority of emerging infectious diseases are caused by rna viruses high rates of mutation short generation times and large population sizes drive their rapid evolution a wide variety of animals including humans are affected and examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov influenza virus human immunodeficiency virus poliovirus hepatitis a b and c virus yellow fever virus dengue virus west nile virus and many others lai and holmes 2001 understanding viral evolution is important because it can lead to outbreaks of known diseases eg the 2009 human pandemic h1n1 influenza virus host shifts and the emergence of new diseases eg hantavirus as well as escape from immune response and antiviral drugs eg human immunodeficiency virus because of their high mutation rates rna viruses exist as a genetically diverse population of related virus particles within a host genetic diversity defined as a measure of all the genotypes genetic variation as well as the frequency of those genotypes in the population is created by mutations including substitutions deletions and insertions and recombination events that occur when the viral genome is replicated viral evolution is the result of a combination of high mutational input and the forces that act on the genetic diversity selection both within and between hosts which will increase the frequency of adaptive mutations and decrease the frequency of deleterious ones and genetic drift during severe transmission bottlenecks which will stochastically and indiscriminately affect the frequency of all types of mutation elena and sanjuan 2007 manrubia and lazaro 2006 the processes involved in the emergence and spread of rna viruses can often be measured in real time making them perfect candidates for the study of the evolution of infectious diseases holmes 2009 coronaviruses are positive sense single stranded rna viruses their viral genome is approximately 2731 kb in length which is the largest of the positive sense single stranded rna viruses recently the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses reorganized the family coronaviridae httptalkictvonlineorgmediap1230aspx the coronaviridae in the order nidovirales are now divided into two subfamilies coronavirinae and torovirinae the coronavirinae are further subdivided into genus alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus based on genetic analysis of the conserved domains in the replicase protein pp1ab and on the structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n the alpha and betacoronaviruses infect and cause disease in mammals whereas the gammacoronaviruses are largely avian viruses the most infamous coronavirus is sars-cov which is currently placed in the betacoronavirus group however sars-cov and sars-cov-like viruses have a different gene order and sequence divergence distinct from many of the viruses in that group in only a few months the virus rapidly spread to over 24 countries infecting 8098 people and killing 774 wwwwhointcsrsarsen extensive testing and quarantine of infected individuals contained the outbreak although there are currently no known cases of sars surveillance continues and rapid recognition and response plans have been put into place the sars-cov emerged from a reservoir of coronaviruses in bats that transmitted to an intermediate host then to humans li et al 2005 thankfully it has not reemerged in humans gammacoronaviruses frequently emerge in avian species one example is turkey coronavirus tcov which emerged from a recombination event that replaced the spike gene of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv a virus of chickens with a spike from an as yet unknown source another example is the repeated emergence of new genetic and antigenic types of ibv in chickens fig 1
 which leads to multiple serotypes of the virus that do not result in immunological cross protection infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious upper-respiratory tract disease of chickens and a severe economic burden on the poultry industry worldwide cavanagh and gelb 2008 the causative agent ibv has also been found in peafowl galliformes and ibv-like viruses have been isolated from teal anas crecca geese anserinae pigeons columbiformes and ducks anseriformes cavanagh 2007 clinical signs of the disease in chickens are watery eyes mucus in the nares and trachea gasping coughing and tracheal rales the disease can also cause a decrease in egg production and egg quality and some strains of the virus can cause an interstitial nephritis when secondary pathogens like avian mycoplasmas escherichia coli ornithobacterium rhinotrachealie andor bordetella avium complicate the disease pneumonia airsaculitis and peritonitis can occur morbidity is almost always 100 whereas mortality can be quite variable depending on the age of the birds strain of the virus and secondary pathogens involved in the disease and can range from 14 to 82 cavanagh and gelb 2008 the virus replicates in epithelial cells causing lesions in the nasal turbinates trachea kidney gonads oviduct lungs and airsacs lesions can also be found in the gastrointestinal tract bursa of fabricius and cecal tonsils the ibv virion has a typical coronavirus pleomorphic shape with the characteristic club-shaped surface projections designated spikes perlman et al 2008 the enveloped virus particle is heat labile unstable at extreme ph and sensitive to most disinfectants the viral genome is 5 capped with a poly-a tail and the gene organization is 5utr-1a1ab-s-3a-3b-e-m-5a-5b-n-3utr the 5 and 3 utrs contain structural motifs that are involved with interactions between the utrs as well as with viral encoded replicase proteins and possibly host proteins li et al 2008 the utrs play a key role in viral rna transcription and replication the 1a and 1ab orfs encode polyproteins that are post-translationally cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins nsps by two viral proteases a papain-like protease plp and the main protease mpro or 3c-like protease van hemert et al 2008 in contrast to the alpha and betacoronaviruses which have 16 nsps nsp1 is lacking in gammacoronaviruses see table 1
 the 1ab polyprotein is translated through a  1 frame-shift at nucleotide position 12466 in ibvmass4141 ay851295 that occurs approximately 2040 of the time imbert et al 2008 the nsp 2 has been shown to play a role in facilitating de novo ibv protein synthesis by blocking protein kinase r pkr phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 eif-2alpha which shuts down protein synthesis in addition nsp 2 induces expression of gadd34 a component of the protein phosphatase 1 pp1 complex which dephosphorylates eif-2alpha wang et al 2009 the nsp 3 contains multiple domains including an acidic domain an adp-ribose 1 phosphatase the papain-like protease plp a y domain and a transmembrane domain imbert et al 2008 neuman et al 2008 the plp of ibv and interestingly also sars-cov is orthologous to plp2 of other coronaviruses like mouse hepatitis virus mhv the plp1 in ibv is truncated whereas in sars-cov it is missing altogether barretto et al 2005 ziebuhr et al 2007 the plp is responsible for cleaving between nsps 23 and 34 and has been shown to contain deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities clementz et al 2010 frieman et al 2009 lindner et al 2005 the nsp 4 is a membrane spanning protein and along with nsps 2 and 6 is thought to anchor the viral replication complex in double membrane vesicles at the golgi graham et al 2008 nonstructural protein 5 contains mpro a cysteine protease with a cys-his catalytic dyad ziebuhr 2006 the mpro is responsible for cleaving nsps 4 through 16 nonstructural proteins 6 through 10 are membrane-localized proteins some of which have rna binding activity and likely play a role in formation of the viral replication complex johnson et al 2010 kumar et al 2007 tangudu et al 2007 zhai et al 2005 ziebuhr 2006 nonstructural protein 1112 is the rna-dependent rna-polymerase rdrp nsp 13 contains the rna helicase nsp 14 contains an exoribonuclease domain nsp 15 has an endoribonuclease domain and nsp 16 is a methyltransferase graham et al 2008 ivanov et al 2004 ziebuhr 2005 ziebuhr 2006 structural protein genes are located at the 3 end of the genome the s glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved in ibv into s1 and s2 subunits the s1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain responsible for virus attachment to host cells and the s2 subunit which is noncovalently attached to s1 has a trans-membrane domain that spans the viral membrane and anchoring the spikes to the virion the s glycoprotein is also involved in virus and cell membrane fusion and entry into the host cell and it contains epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies variability in the s1 gene is responsible for the multiple different genetic and antigenic types of the virus see fig 1 the e protein is an integral membrane protein and the m protein is a membrane spanning protein both are involved with virus assembly the n protein binds to the viral genome plays a role in viral rna replication and in virion assembly it is well documented that multiple serotypes of ibv exist that do not cross-neutralize fabricant 1998 genetic information for the s gene strongly suggests that different serotypes as defined by neutralizing antibodies exist for many other coronaviruses however they have only been reported for feline coronavirus fcov types i and ii and there is some evidence that two serotypes may exist for sars-cov decaro et al 2009 hohdatsu et al 1991 in addition to multiple serotypes of ibv there are countless variant viruses some of which may also fail to cross react in a virus neutralization test multiple different serotypes with little or no cross protection makes control of ibv which is primarily through the use of attenuated live vaccines extremely challenging the average rate of synonymous mutation in all coronaviruses including ibv is approximately 12  103 substitutionssiteyear hanada et al 2004 holmes 2009 the rate of other rna viruses with smaller genomes can be as high as 1  101 substitutionssiteyear the difference is presumably due to the presence of a 3 to 5 exoribonuclease exon domain in nsp 14 which contains similarities to host proteins involved in proofreading and repair minskaia et al 2006 snijder et al 2003 using an nsp 14-exon mutant sars-cov eckerle et al 2010 showed impaired growth and a 21-fold increase in mutation rate for the mutant virus compared to wild type that data and their previous work with a mouse hepatitis virus coronavirus mhvcov exon mutant eckerle et al 2007 confirms that exon which is conserved in all coronaviruses does contribute to the fidelity of the viral rdrp high fidelity of the polymerase results in a higher error threshold and likely permits the virus to maintain a large genome size holmes 2009 the emergence of new strains and serotypes of ibv is largely due to the accumulation of mutations in the s gene over time as opposed to recombination events this is thought to be the primary method of cross-species transmission and was shown to lead to the emergence of sars-cov holmes and rambaut 2004 hon et al 2008 recombination can reduce mutational load create genetic variants that may be very

 tend to lie immediately upstream of the s glycoprotein gene as well as in nsp 2 nsp 3 and nsp 16 armesto et al 2009 hagemeijer et al 2010 thor et al 2011 recombination in the nonstructural proteins associated with the rdrp can alter replication efficiency of the virus which can in turn affect pathogenicity because the s glycoprotein gene is involved in host cell attachment and contains viral neutralizing epitopes recombination in the s glycoprotein gene can result in the emergence of new strains or serotypes of the virus as well as new viruses capable of causing disease in other host species the emergence of new variants and serotypes of ibv whether the result of mutations or recombination occurs continuously jackwood et al 2005 recombination directly leading to the emergence of a new avian coronavirus in turkeys tcov was recently documented the s gene of ibv recombined with an unknown virus which altered its pathotype respiratory to enteric and host specificity chicken to turkey resulting in the emergence of tcov jackwood et al 2010 data from that study showed that the full-length genomes of ibv and tcov are greater than 86 similar whereas the spike glycoproteins are less than 36 similar with clear recombination break points at the 3 end of gene 1ab nucleotide position 20173 immediately upstream of the s gene and in the 3 end of the spike gene nucleotide position 23849 jackwood et al 2010 it is likely that the unknown virus contributing s gene sequences in the emergence of tcov is another avian coronavirus since the only evidence of a gamma coronavirus recombining with either an alpha or beta coronavirus is the mosaic composition reported for the sars-cov zhang et al 2004 control of infectious bronchitis virus in commercial poultry is through the use of live attenuated and killed vaccines since little or no cross-protection occurs between different serotypes or different variants of the virus a variety of different virus antigenic types are used in vaccines typically more than one immunization is given and multivalent vaccines containing two or more antigenic types are used in an attempt to provide broad protection it is not uncommon for vaccines to induce only partial protection against varied antigenic types of the virus which allows some viruses to continue to replicate and persist in a flock presumably replication of the virus in a vaccinated host provides it with an opportunity to further adapt and evade the immune response gandon and day 2008 gandon et al 2001 the use of modified live vaccine can result in faster evolutionary rates in ibv mutation rates for the 793b ibv type where vaccines against that specific serotype were not used have been estimated to be 3  103 substitutionssiteyear cavanagh et al 1998 whereas the ga98 virus which emerged in the face of vaccination with the closely related de072 type was reported to have a mutation rate of 15  102 substitutionssiteyear lee and jackwood 2001 however caution must be exercised when estimating mutation rates of ibv antigenic types when live attenuated vaccines against that same virus type are used mutation rates for mass and conn ibv types where live vaccines against those types are commonly used were estimated to be 19  103 and 15  104 nucleotide changessiteyear respectively mckinley et al 2011 reisolation of vaccine viruses that are continuously introduced into the field and circulating in birds for a relatively short period of time likely contributed to the apparently low mutation rates emergence of new variants or serotypes of ibv is dependent on the ability of existing strains to be transmitted from one individual to another the average number of new infections caused by one infected individual reproductive number r is a measure of the sustainability of a virus in the host population for r
  1 the chain of transmission is not sustainable and the disease slowly dies out for r
  1 the number of infected hosts increases which in some cases can result in an epidemic eventually the pool of susceptible hosts is sufficiently depleted or intervention measures are implemented and r drops to below 1 the reproductive number for the situation where all hosts are susceptible basic reproductive number r
0 is a measure of the transmissibility of a given pathogen the r
0 value for ibv has been estimated to be 1995 which is extremely high comparable to highly transmissible human diseases such as measles and reflects the highly infectious nature of this virus de wit et al 1998 vaccination with a homologous antigenic type of the virus was found to reduce r
0 to 069 indicating that proper and careful vaccination with a well-matched vaccine is an effective control strategy for ibv de wit et al 1998 transmission of a virus from one individual to another individual often involves a bottleneck where only a small number of virions are transmitted severely restricted transmission bottlenecks have been predicted for hiv where studies suggest that new infections are started by a single virion abrahams et al 2009 in contrast a more recent study on equine influenza virus showed that although the consensus sequence did not vary genetically distinct subpopulations of the virus were transmitted to a new susceptible host suggesting a somewhat less restrictive transmission bottleneck murcia et al 2010 theoretically transmission through a restrictive bottleneck followed by rapid expansion of the number of virus particles in the host can take a rare virus subpopulation and make it the predominant type potentially leading to the emergence of a new genotype whether this is the mechanism behind the emergence of new types of ibv is not known because there exists little in vivo experimental data on bottlenecks and expansion of viruses transmitting and replicating in their natural animal host there is a substantial body of experimental studies in the laboratory especially using bacteriophages that have addressed a variety of evolutionary factors including transmission bottlenecks and the dynamics of adaptation reviewed in elena and sanjuan 2007 however in vivo experiments in animal hosts have usually involved only two or a few individuals which makes predicting viral evolution as a virus is transmitted through several hosts ie over many transmission events extremely difficult bouma et al 2009 coffey et al 2008 hoelzer et al 2010 van der goot et al 2005 while studies are being performed to try to bridge the gap between the laboratory and nature it is a challenging task consequently there is a critical need for studies that utilize multiple-host chains of transmission similar to those used in vitro but where host to host transmission events involve natural infections in an experimental setting that allows for accurate measurements of viral evolution at critical time points understanding transmission and development of viral genetic diversity in a natural setting will hopefully elucidate the mechanisms behind the emergence of different genetic and antigenic types of ibv allowing us to prevent or at least to better predict the emergence of new coronavirus diseases the rapid evolution of ibv makes this virus an excellent model to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host mathematical models on their own or in combination with experimental data have proven to be useful for understanding various aspects of viral dynamics and evolution examples of topics that have received significant modeling attention are the estimation of transmissibility r

reservoir song et al 2005 other coronaviruses including ibv have to our knowledge not been modeled but a combination of the experimental approaches outlined above with appropriate models seems to be a promising direction to gain general insights into evolutionary dynamics as well as to help with the further development of effective ibv control strategies the recent availability and reduced cost of quantitative deep-sequencing methods should aid in providing data in the future that will be ideally suited for mathematical and statistical modeling to estimate relevant parameters and predict transmission dynamics compared to other coronaviruses multiple serotypes and variant viruses that continue to adapt and change appears to be unique to ibv and makes diagnosis and control of ibv extremely challenging traditional virus neutralization tests conducted in embryonated eggs are expensive and time consuming taking weeks or months to type only a few viruses currently molecular typing tests that involve rt-pcr amplification of the s1 gene followed by nucleotide sequence analysis is being used to inexpensively determine the genetic type of a number of viruses in a short period of time in addition since the s1 gene of inactivated viruses can be amplified and sequenced viruses can be imported with the proper permits from abroad this along with an explosion of genetic data available in genbank httpwwwncbinlmnihgov has allowed genetic comparison of ibv isolates from all over the world significantly improving epidemiological data and attempts to control the disease callison et al 2001 identification of the ibv type causing an outbreak in commercial poultry is necessary to be able to choose the appropriate vaccines capable of inducing a protective immune response because only a few vaccine types and in many countries only one vaccine mass type h120 can be used variant viruses persist and outbreaks continue to occur gelb et al 1991 ignjatovic et al 2006 jackwood et al 2005 jackwood et al 2009 evolutionary rates for ibv are so rapid that even live attenuated vaccines undergo selection and mutation following only a single round of infection in the host one study compared reisolated vaccine viruses with the original vaccine virus administered to the bird and found that selection of subpopulations as well as mutations were occurring in the s1 gene mckinley et al 2008 another study found distinct virus subpopulations in the s1 gene were selected when chickens were vaccinated with the ark-dpi strain of ibv van santen and toro 2008 further analysis found that virus subpopulations were different in the microenvironment of distinct tissues of the host gallardo et al 2010 these data indicate that different selection pressures leading to evolution of the virus during replication in the host can result in an even higher degree of virus diversity a wide variety of genetic and antigenic variants of avian coronavirus ibv coupled with continuous emergence of new types make this virus an ideal model to study viral evolution multiple infected hosts high replication within hosts and high mutation rates lead to an extraordinarily diverse population of virus particles which facilitates the evolution of the virus determining the size of bottlenecks during transmission and the changes in virus genetic diversity during single and multiple infection cycles and how these affect transmission is important for evaluating the role of drift and selection on evolution which is critical for the control of outbreaks of infectious bronchitis as well as other known coronaviral diseases in addition that knowledge is an important step in understanding the evolution of rna viruses which will make it possible to take a proactive approach to preventing the emergence of new coronaviral diseases  post-translational modifications of coronavirus proteins roles and function to fung sing ding liu xiang   disulfide bonding contributes to the folding of mhv s proteins when mhv-infected cells were briefly exposed to reducing agent dithiothreitol added to culture medium newly synthesized mhv s protein was completely reduced as indicated by a shift of mobility in nonreducing gel 20 reduction of mhv s protein was associated with a loss of conformation as the protein could no longer be recognized by a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody when dithiothreitol was withdrawn the s protein folded aberrantly into disulfide-linked aggregates from which properly folded s protein subsequently dissociated 20 therefore disulfide bond formation is essential for the correct folding trafficking and trimerization of mhv s protein in another study the recombinant s1 domain of sars-cov s protein was used to study the redox state of the 20 cysteine residues 23 interestingly four cysteines remained unpaired in mature s1 and chemical reduction using -mercaptoethanol did not impair the binding of s1 to the cognate receptor ace2 furthermore treatment of sulfhydryl-blocking agent dtnb or the oxidoreductase inhibitor bacitracin did not inhibit the fusion of sars-cov pseudotyped particles while the fusion of hiv- or mlv-pseudotyped virus was significantly affected 23 these data suggest that the s1 domain of sars-cov s protein exhibits a high level of insensitivity to redox state n-linked glycosylation of coronavirus s protein was first described for mhv in the 1980s 21 mhv s protein in the rough er was found to acquire high mannose oligosaccharides treatment of the golgi transport blocker monensin inhibited the transport of mhv s protein from trans-golgi network to the cell surface 21 later studies demonstrated that s proteins of ibv 24 tgev 2526 bovine coronavirus bcov 27 were also modified by n-linked glycosylation using pulse-chase experiments coupled with fractionation it was found that high mannose glycans were acquired by monomer of the tgev s protein followed by the rate-limiting assembly of monomers into a trimeric structure and terminal glycosylation of the newly assembled trimers 28 similarly sars-cov s protein was found to acquire high mannose oligosaccharides and trimerize as early as 30 min postentry into er prior to the acquisition of complex glycans in the golgi complex 29 the maturation status of sars-cov s protein can thus be monitored by its sensitivity to endoglycosidase h endo h which hydrolyzes high mannose glycans but not complex glycans 30 using mass spectrometry the structure of n-linked glycans on sars-cov s protein was determined which were composed of high mannose hybrid and complex glycans with and without bisecting n-acetyl-galactosamine galnac and core fucose 31 with the advent of molecular cloning technologies the coding sequences of s proteins from numerous coronaviruses were cloned and the putative n-linked glycosylation sites were predicted from the sequence information for instance 20 32 or 21 33 glycosylation sites were predicted in the s protein of mhv 19 in bovine enteric coronavirus 3435 30 in hcov-229e 36 33 in tgev 37 20 38 or 22 39 in hcov-oc43 29 40 or 27 41 in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv 33 in feline enteric coronavirus 42 29 or 33 in canine coronavirus 43 20 or 21 in canine respiratory coronavirus 44 however it should be noted that not all of the putative glycosylation sites are functional in fact among the 23 putative glycosylation sites in the sars-cov s protein only 12 sites were actually glycosylated as determined by mass spectrometry following peptiden-glycosidase f pngase f digestion 45 recently we have used in solution deglycosylation combined with mass spectrometry to determine the n-linked glycosylation sites in the ibv s protein 46 as deglycosylation was carried out in the h2o18 environment incorporation of o18 to asp resulted in a mass increment of 298 da leading to a more robust identification of glycosylated sites by mass spectrometry among the 29 predicted n-linked glycosylation sites only eight sites were confirmed using this method therefore majority of the predicted n-linked glycosylation sites on coronavirus s protein may not be modified possibly due to the massive amount of s protein produced during infection and the limited capacities of the cellular glycosylation enzymes some sites may be preferentially modified due to their relatively better spatial availability while some inefficiently andor partially glycosylated sites may not reach the detection limit for mass spectrometry 46 thus the predicted glycosylation sites are not fully utilized in coronavirus s protein preferential glycosylation on certain critical sites such as those located within or near the rbd may be of particular importance in the functionality of s protein n-linked glycosylation contributes significantly to the conformation of coronavirus s protein and therefore profoundly affects the receptor binding and antigenicity of s protein for example early studies showed that the binding of ibv neutralizing antibodies was dependent on the glycosylation of the ibv s protein 47 consistently mutations that introduced new n-linked glycosylation sites in the s1 domain were shown to contribute to antigenic shifting of ibv 48 also when the s1 domain of bcov s protein was cloned and expressed in insect cells the mature protein was glycosylated and bound by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 49 in contrast when cells were infected with tgev in the presence of tunicamycin an inhibitor of n-linked glycosylation the antigenicity of both s and m protein was significantly reduced 50 similarly when the overexpressed full-length homotrimeric sars-cov s protein was treated with pngase f under a native condition the protein was no longer recognized by neutralizing antisera raised against purified virions 51 this finding suggests that n-linked glycosylation may play an important role in constituting the native structure of coronavirus s protein thereby affecting its antigenicity during its maturation in the er sars-cov s protein binds to the molecular chaperone calnexin 52 compared with control sars-cov s-pseudotyped virions produced in calnexin-knockdown cells contained s protein with aberrant n-glycans and exhibited significantly lower infectivity 52 as for ibv we recently showed that n-d or n-q mutations at the n-linked glycosylation site n212 or n276 abolished the function of s protein to induce cellcell fusion and the infectivity of corresponding recombinant viruses 46 nonetheless in some instances the antigenicity of coronavirus s protein does not depend on its glycosylation status for example when the s protein of tgev was expressed by recombinant baculovirus in insect cells the recombinant s protein acquired high mannose glycans but the complete processing into complex glycans was not efficient however the recombinant tgev s protein still exhibited antigenic properties and induced a high level of neutralizing antibodies 53 similarly a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody against the s1 protein of sars-cov could bind to the deglycosylated s1 protein suggesting that the epitope was not glycosylation-dependent 54 in one early study the rbd of sars-cov s protein was mapped to amino acid residues 319518 which contained two potential glycosylation sites n330 and n357 however mutation of n330 or n357 to either alanine or glutamine did not affect the binding ability of rbd-containing fragment to the cognate receptor ace2 55 later the structure of rbd of sars-cov s protein complexed with human ace2 was determined and both n330 and n357 were not positioned in the interface where the two proteins interacted 56 it was thus concluded that glycosylation did not always constitute neutralizing epitopes within the rbd a later study exploring recombinant rbd of sars-cov s protein as a vaccine candidate found that yeast-expressed recombinant rbd spanning amino acid residues 318536 with glycosylation sites removed indeed induced a higher level of neutralizing antibody in immunized mice compared with wild type rbd 57 although not essential for its binding to the cellular receptor ace2 n-linked glycosylation of sars-cov may still contribute to efficient attachment of virions to the host cells the c-type lectin dc-sign was shown to facilitate cell entry of sars-cov 5859 the dc-sign binding region was mapped to amino acid residues 324386 of sars-cov and pseudotyped viruses with mutated n-linked glycosylation sites n330q or n357q had significantly reduced dc-sign-binding capacity 60 in a separate study seven glycosylation sites n109 n118 n119 n158 n227 n589 and n699 in sars-cov s protein were also shown to be critical for virus entry mediated by the dc-sign andor l-sign 61 the interaction between n-linked glycans and lectins can also negatively affect receptor binding of coronavirus for example mannose-binding lectin was shown to interact with sars-cov s-pseudotyped virus and block viral binding to dc-sign and n-linked glycosylation at n330 was found critical for the specific interaction between mannose-binding lectin and sars-cov s protein 62 since n330 is also critical for dc-sign-binding competitive binding between the two lectins to n-linked glycans on sars-cov s protein may have some implications in the attachment and entry of virions at last lsectin a lectin coexpressed with dc-sign on sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver and lymph node was also shown to interact with sars-cov s-pseudotyped virus 63 n-linked glycosylation may also contribute to the activation of innate immune response in coronavirus-infected cells pretreatment of tgev-infected cells with the plant lectin concanavalin a before exposure to porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells led to a dose-dependent reduction in the induction of ifn- also inhibition of n-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin or removal of n-linked glycans by pngase f reduced tgev-induced ifn- production 64 therefore n-linked glycans on coronavirus s protein may be a pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognized by host pattern recognition receptors which in turn activate downstream antiviral innate immune response however compared with the parental pedv strain the more effective host immune response against the cell attenuated zhejiang08 strain was associated with the lack of a potential glycosylation site in its s protein 65 thus the effect of s protein glycosylation on the immune response is complex which may vary depending on the specific coronavirus and host system in question caution should also be taken regarding the biological systems used to express the coronavirus s protein for example a recent study evaluated the antigenicity of recombinant ibv s1 protein expressed in mammalian cells the result showed that the recombinant s1 protein was highly glycosylated and was able to induce the production of antibodies against s1 in immunized chickens however these antibodies had lower neutralizing activity compared with those generated by chickens immunized with inactivated ibv 66 therefore the glycosylation pattern of ibv s protein synthesized in mammalian cells may differ from those produced in avian cells thereby affecting its antigenicity in vivo similarly the glycosylation pattern of other coronavirus proteins may also be differentially affected by the expression systems thereby changing their behaviors in relevant functional assays interestingly some of the known cellular receptors for coronavirus have also been shown to be modified by glycosylation n-linked glycosylation of ceacam1 the cellular receptor protein of mhv was found essential for its binding to mhv-a59 virions 67 although recombinant proteins with mutations in the three n-linked glycosylation sites in the n-terminal domain were still functional 68 on the other hand insertion of an n-linked glycosylation site into human apn the receptor for hcov-229e abolished its activity to bind hcov-229e virions 69 similarly n-linked glycosylation of dpp4 the cognate receptor of mers-cov dramatically affects its binding to mers-cov s protein normally mouse dpp4 does not support mers-cov entry however when the n328 glycosylation site was mutated in the presence of a secondary mutation a288l the binding affinity of mouse dpp4 to mers-cov was significantly increased 70 conversely when the corresponding glycosylation site was introduced to human dpp4 the binding of mers-cov was significantly reduced 70 therefore glycosylation of coronavirus receptors contributes significantly to the host tropism of coronavirus infection although additional sequence and structural determinants of s protein are also involved 71 palmitoylation of coronavirus s protein was initially identified in cells infected with mhv-a59 as 3h-palmitate was found to be incorporated in unglycosylated s protein in mhv-infected cells treated with tunicamycin 22 treatment of palmitoyl acyltransferase inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate at a nontoxic dose reduced palmitoylation of mhv s protein and led to a significant reduction in the infectivity of mhv 72 reduction of s palmitoylation correlated with a decreased level of s associated with m protein and subsequent exclusion of s from virions however underpalmitoylated s protein could still be expressed on the cell surface to induce cellcell fusion the c1347fc1348s mutant virus harboring mutations in the putative palmitoylation sites exhibited reduced infectivity further supporting the importance of palmitoylation in virion assembly and infectivity 72 using antiviral heptad repeat peptides that only bind to folding intermediates of the fusion process it was found that mhv s mutants lacking the palmitoylated cysteines were trapped in translational folding states almost ten-times longer than wild-type mhv s protein leading to slower cell entry and reduced infectivity 73 in a later study using reverse genetics the nine cytoplasmic cysteines in mhv s protein were singly or doubly substituted to alanine 74 interestingly no single specific cysteine in the mhv s endodomain was essential for viral replication but a minimum of three cysteines within the motif independent of position was required for the recovery of viable recombinant mhv 74 the cytoplasmic portion of sars-cov s protein contains four cysteine-rich clusters mutational analysis showed that cysteine clusters i and ii were modified by palmitoylation although cell surface expression of sars-cov s protein was not significantly affected by mutations in cysteine clusters i and ii s-mediated cell fusion was markedly reduced compared with wild-type protein suggesting that palmitoylation in the endodomain may be required for the fusogenic activity of sars-cov s protein 75 in a later study a recombinant nonpalmitoylated sars-cov s protein was generated by mutating all nine cytoplasmic cysteines to alanines 76 using this nonpalmitoylated mutant it was shown that similar to mhv s protein palmitoylation of the sars-cov s protein was required for its partitioning into detergent-resistant membranes and for cellcell fusion however unlike mhv s protein palmitoylation of sars-cov s protein was not required for sm interaction 76 interestingly treatment of nitric oxide or its derivatives led to a reduction in the palmitoylation of sars-cov s protein which affected its binding to the cognate receptor ace2 77 the s protein of the alphacoronavirus tgev is also modified by palmitoylation and inhibition of palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate treatment reduced tgev replication in cell culture 78 although palmitoylation of tgev s protein was essential for its incorporation into virus-like particles vlp the interaction between tgev s and m proteins was not affected by the lack of palmitoylation 78 therefore dependent on the coronavirus in question palmitoylation may differentially affect the folding fusogenic activity andor proteinprotein interaction of s protein palmitoylation of s protein has not been characterized for other coronaviruses based on sequence prediction sars-cov e protein contains two potential n-linked glycosylation sites on n48 and n66 whereas ibv e contains one potential site on n5 although topological study demonstrated that ibv e protein spanned the membrane once with a luminal n-terminus and a cytoplasmic c-terminus the glycosylation site on n5 was not functional 7980 on the other hand sars-cov e protein in transfected cells seemed to adopt two distinct membrane topologies 80 in one form both the n- and c-termini were exposed to the cytoplasmic side and the protein was not modified by glycosylation in an alternative minor form sars-cov e protein was shown to be glycosylated on n66 with the c-terminus exposed to the luminal side 80 a later study using transfected sars-cov e protein with an n-terminal myc-tag confirmed that sars-cov e protein was glycosylated co-translationally 83 although the two putative tm domains were required for its interaction with the sars-cov m protein the hydrophilic region 6076 flanking the n66 glycosylation site was dispensable as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiment 83 the glycosylation of sars-cov e protein during actual infection and its biological function remain to be further investigated all the three cysteine residues c40 c43 and c44 in sars-cov e protein are also modified by palmitoylation 82 which may regulate its subcellular trafficking and association with lipid rafts in fact when the homologous cysteine residues in the e protein of mhv-a59 c40 c44 and c47 were doubly or triply mutated to alanine its ability to induce vlp formation was significantly reduced 8485 moreover mhv e protein carrying triple mutations c40ac44ac47a was prone to degradation and the corresponding recombinant mhv had significantly reduced yield compared with wild-type 85 while wild-type mhv e protein mobilized co-expressed m protein into detergent-soluble secreted forms in cells expressing the triple c-to-a mhv e protein the co-expressed m protein accumulated into detergent-insoluble complexes that were not secreted 84 therefore palmitoylation of mhv e protein contributes to its stability and biological activity during assembly of mature virions on the other hand palmitoylation of sars-cov e protein is not required for its association with n protein and vlp production and thus possibly dispensable for sars-cov assembly 86 o-linked glycosylation of the mhv m protein was first discovered in 1981 90 it was found that in the presence of tunicamycin an inhibitor of n-linked glycosylation synthesis of the s protein was completely inhibited but m protein was still normally produced and glycosylated resulting in the formation of noninfectious virions containing normal amounts of n and m protein but lacking s completely 90 when it was expressed from transfected cdna m protein of mhv-a59 also underwent o-linked glycosylation and was localized in the golgi region 92 the structures of the o-linked glycans of mhv-a59 m protein were characterized 93 and pulse-chase labeling experiments showed that the o-linked glycans were acquired in a two-step process galnac was added before the addition of galactose and sialic acid 94 after the sequential acquisition of galnac galactose and sialic acid the m protein of mhv-a59 was further modified in the trans-golgi network 95 apart from mhv o-linked glycosylation was also found in the m protein of two other lineage a betacoronaviruses bcov 2796 and hcov-oc43 97 since its discovery o-linked glycosylation has been used as a marker to study the maturation membrane insertion and intracellular trafficking of mhv m protein 9899 in fact due to its high expression level in transfected or mhv-infected cells the m protein of mhv has also been used as a model protein to study o-linked glycosylation and vesicular trafficking between er and the golgi compartments 100 initial studies proposed the four highly conserved hydroxyamino acids s2 s3 t4 and t5 at the extreme n terminus of mhv m protein as the putative o-linked glycosylation sites 93 follow-up investigations further pinpointed t5 as the functional acceptor site and the downstream p8 was also required for efficient o-linked glycosylation 101 however the hydroxylamino acid cluster per se was not sufficient as downstream amino acids must also be included to introduce a functional o-linked glycosylation site into a foreign protein 101 interestingly in the highly virulent strain mhv-2 the s-s-t-t sequence was mutated to n-s-t-t and n-linked glycosylation was shown to be added to the n2 residue 102 however whether the presence of extra sugars would affect the function of mhv-2 m protein has not been fully understood o-linked glycosylation is not essential for the assembly of mhv virions as mutations that abolished the normal o-linked glycosylation site did not inhibit the budding of infectious virions 103 or growth kinetics in cell culture 104 however it was found that recombinant mhv containing n-linked glycosylated m protein induced a higher level of type i interferon compared with the wild-type mhv with o-linked glycosylated m protein whereas mhv with nonglycosylated m protein was a poor interferon inducer in cell culture 104 the in vitro interferongenic capacity also correlated with the abilities of these viruses to replicate in the liver of infected mice suggesting that glycosylation status of m protein might affect the induction of innate immune response by mhv infection 104 distinct from the o-link glycosylation observed in the m protein of mhv bcov and hcov-oc43 the m protein of alphacoronavirus tgev 105 and pedv 106 as well as gammacoronavirus ibv 91 and turkey enteric coronavirus 107 are all modified by n-linked glycosylation which is sensitive to endo h and can be inhibited by tunicamycin the n-linked glycosylation sites were mapped to n3 and n6 of ibv unpublished data from this group within the betacoronavirus genus m protein of coronaviruses in other lineages is also n-linked glycosylated for example sars-cov m protein contains a single n-glycosylation site at n4 108109 when transiently transfected as a c-terminally flag-tagged protein sars-cov m protein was found to obtain high-mannose n-glycans that were modified into complex n-glycans in the golgi 29 however in a later study using sars-cov infected cells and purified sars-cov virions glycosylated m protein was shown to remain endo h sensitive suggesting that trimming and maturation of n-linked glycans were inhibited during actual sars-cov infection 109 similar to o-linked glycosylation of mhv n-linked glycosylation of sars-cov m protein is not essential for viral replication as recombinant sars-cov with glycosylation-deficient m protein had normal virion morphology and retained its infectivity in cell culture 110 however unlike o-linked glycosylation that conferred ifn antagonism to the mhv m protein the ifn-antagonizing activity of sars-cov m protein was independent of n-linked glycosylation and might be mediated through its first tm domain 111 phosphorylation of coronavirus n protein was first described in ip60k cells infected with mhv-jhm where a protein kinase associated with purified virions was shown to transfer the -phosphate of atp to serine residues to the mhv n protein 118 a later study showed that the mhv-jhm n protein was synthesized initially in a nonphosphorylated 57-kda form detected exclusively in the cytosol while the subsequent phosphorylated 60-kda form was associated with the cellular membrane fraction and mature virion 123 similarly 32p-orthophosphate labeling showed that the phosphorylation level of ibv n protein was significantly higher in the virion than in the infected cell lysates 124 in sharp contrast only the phosphatase insensitive nonphosphorylated form of n protein was detected in extracellular virions of bcov-infected cells suggesting that dephosphorylation of bcov n protein may facilitate its specific assembly 125 therefore the phosphorylation status of n protein may differentially regulate coronavirus assembly for different viruses in question phosphorylation sites and the corresponding protein kinases have been identified for some coronaviruses for the alphacoronavirus tgev four phosphorylation sites have been identified in the n protein namely s9 s156 s254 and s256 126 using mass spectroscopy two clusters of phosphorylation sites were identified in ibv namely amino acid residues s190s192 and t378s379 127 importantly although both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ibv n protein bound to viral rna with the same affinity phosphorylated n protein bound to viral rna with higher affinity than nonviral rna compared with the nonphosphorylated ibv n protein 127 this suggests that n phosphorylation may facilitate the differential recognition of viral rna consistently using a reverse genetic system based on vaccinia virus spencer et al showed that ibv n protein was essential for the recovery of recombinant ibv and that phosphorylated ibv n protein was more efficient than partially or nonphosphorylated n protein 128 phosphorylation at t378 and s379 of ibv n protein was shown to be dependent on atr a kinase activated during ibv replication 119 however recombinant ibv harboring alanine substitutions at all four putative phosphorylation sites s190as192at378as379a could still be recovered and grew at a similar growth rate as wild-type ibv suggesting that atr-dependent phosphorylation of n protein is not essential for ibv replication in vitro 119 as for betacoronavirus the n protein of sars-cov can be phosphorylated by multiple host kinases including cyclin-dependent kinase glycogen synthase kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase and casein kinase ii 129 using mass spectrometry analysis six phosphorylation sites s162 s170 t177 s389 s424 and t428 on the mhv-a59 n protein were identified 130 phosphorylation of the n protein of sars-cov and mhv-jhm by the host protein gsk-3 was precisely mapped to s197 and s177 in the serine arginine-rich region respectively 131 moreover inhibition of gsk-3 by kenpaullone significantly reduced the phosphorylation level of n protein as well as the supernatant virus titer and cytopathic effects on veroe6 cell-infected sars-cov 131 therefore phosphorylation of the n protein appears to be essential for the replication of some betacoronaviruses in fact a recent study showed that phosphorylation of the mhv-jhm n protein by gsk-3 allowed the recruitment of rna helicase ddx1 to facilitate template read-through enabling the synthesis of genomic rna and longer sgrnas 132 on the other hand when n protein was not phosphorylated template switching was favored during transcription leading to the preferential generation of shorter sgrnas but not genomic rna or longer sgrnas 132 therefore the phosphorylation status of mhv-jhm n protein acts as a switch to regulate the process of genome replicationtranscription phosphorylation of the sars-cov n protein may also affect its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling which is mediated by its interaction with the host adapter protein 14-13-3 129 additionally sars-cov n protein was shown to translocate to cytoplasmic stress granules in response to cellular stress while phosphorylation in the serine-arginine rich region inhibited this translocation 133 since stress granules play important roles in translation control and antiviral immune response phosphorylation of n protein may be a strategy used by sars-cov to antagonize host antiviral mechanisms 134 at last compared with sars-cov n protein expressed in escherichia coli recombinant sars-cov n protein produced by the baculovirus system in insect cells showed significantly higher immunoreactivity and antigenic specificity 135 as dephosphorylation by pp1 also reduced the immunoreactivity of sars-cov n protein it was proposed that phosphorylation might also contribute to the antigenicity sars-cov n protein 135 one early study shows that the n protein of tgev was cleaved at d359 during the late stage of infection presumably by the activated caspase-6 and -7 during tgev-induced apoptosis 136 similarly the n protein of sars-cov was also cleaved at d400 and d403 by caspases during lytic infection in vero e6 and a549 cells but not during persistent infection in caco-2 and n2a cells 137 cleavage of the sars-cov n protein was mediated by caspase-6 andor caspase-3 and was dependent on the nuclear localization of the n protein 137 we have also observed cleavage of the ibv n protein during late stage ibv infection 138139 thus proteolytic cleavage of the n protein may be a common outcome associated with coronavirus-induced apoptosis in the infected cells although the biological significance is not known presumably coronavirus n protein may compete with other caspase substrates for cleavage so as to promote cell survival in order to prolong the duration of virion release yeast two-hybrid screen identified ubc9 a host protein involved in sumoylation as an interacting partner of sars-cov n protein 140 biochemical analysis confirmed that sars-cov n protein was modified by sumoylation at lysine 62 which significantly promoted homo-oligomerization of the n protein 120140 the biological significance of this modification on the viral replication and coronavirushost interactions remains to be investigated a novel form of ptm known as adp-ribosylation was recently recognized in which single or multiple adp-ribose moieties are covalently attached to a protein this process is catalyzed by enzymes called poly-adp-ribose polymerases and utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as the adp-ribose donor interestingly n proteins of mhv pedv sars-cov and mers-cov were all shown to be adp-ribosylated in the infected cells while adp-ribosylated mhv n protein was also detected in the purified virions 121 notably mhv n protein expressed from transfected plasmids was only adp-ribosylated in the context of virus infection suggesting that enzymes catalyzing this modification are activated by coronavirus infection and additional viral components may be involved among all the coronavirus nsps three of them are known to contain tm domains that facilitate their insertion into er membrane nsp3 and nsp4 have two and four tm domains respectively 141 while nsp6 contains six tm domains with a hydrophobic c-terminal cytosolic tail 142 these three nsps are proposed to reorganize er membrane to form dmvs and to facilitate the assembly and anchorage of the replicationtranscription complex to the dmvs in fact co-expression of sars-cov nsp3 nsp4 and nsp6 induced dmv formation in the transfected cells 143 a more recent study showed that for both mers-cov and sars-cov co-expression of nsp3 and nsp4 was already sufficient to induce dmv formation 144 on the other hand overexpression of coronavirus nsp6 induced the formation of autophagosomes 145 but at the same time restricted its expansion 146 therefore nsp3 nsp4 and nsp6 are closely associated with cellular membrane dynamics in coronavirus-infected cells given their membrane multispanning nature it is not surprising that some of the luminal domains undergo n-linked glycosylation in the er figure 6 for example mhv nsp3 is inserted into er co-translationally and glycosylated at n1525 147 glycosylation of nsp4 was first identified in ibv lim et al 2000 by glycosidase digestion and site-directed mutagenesis the glycosylation site of ibv nsp4 was confirmed to be at n48 148 as for the nsp4 of mhv two glycosylation sites were predicted at n176 and n237 in one early study using reverse genetics it was found that whereas recombinant mhv harboring nsp4-n176a mutation replicated identically to the wt control nsp4-n237a was lethal and no recombinant virus could be recovered 149 in a later study using identical infectious clone system based on mhv-a59 gadlage et al successfully recovered recombinant mhv with n176a n273a or n176an273a mutation in nsp4 150 interestingly all nsp4 glycosylation mutants exhibited aberrant morphology of dmvs and were defective in viral rna synthesis and virus growth supporting a critical role of n-linked glycosylation in the dmv formation activity of mhv nsp4 150 in a recent follow-up study other mutations distinct from glycosylation sites were introduced in mhv nsp4 similar to the glycosylation mutants some of these mutants also exhibited altered dmv morphology however only mutations in the nsp4 glycosylation sites resulted in a loss of fitness in the recombinant mhv 151 therefore apart from dmv formation n-linked glycosylation of mhv nsp4 may serve other critical roles during viral replication coronavirus nsp9 has been characterized as an ssrna binding protein 152 the colocalization of nsp9 with other replicase proteins 153 and its interaction with the coronavirus rdrp 154 suggested that the ssrna-binding activity of nsp9 might play a role during coronavirus genome transcriptionreplication crystallography studies showed that sars-cov nsp9 formed homodimer 154 and higher oligomers could be observed in solution using glutaraldehyde cross-linking 155 surprisingly in spite of 45 sequence homology nsp9 of hcov-229e but not sars-cov was shown to form homodimer linked by a disulfide bond figure 6 155 mutation of the disulfide bond forming cysteine 69 to either alanine or serine significantly reduced the binding affinity of hcov-229e nsp9 to ssrna or ssdna as determined by surface plasmon resonance experiments although disulfide bonds are rare in cytosolic proteins a disulfide-bonded form of nsp9 may be correlated with oxidative stress induced by hcov-229e infection 155 coronavirus nsp16 has been identified as a nucleoside-2o-methyltransferase 2-o-mtase 156 by modifying the cap-0 structure at the ribose 2-o position of the first nucleotide to form cap-1 structures nsp16 enables the viral rna to avoid detection by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor mda5 in fact compared with wild-type control recombinant virus lacking the nsp16 2-o-mtase activity induced a high level of type i interferon in the infected cells and viral replication was highly sensitive to the antiviral function of exogenous interferon 157 using yeast two-hybrid screening a component of e3 ubiquitin ligase  von hippel lindau vhl was found to interact with sars-cov nsp16 158 overexpression of vhl promoted the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of sars-cov nsp16 while knockdown of vhl increased the protein stability of nsp16 158 however the precise ubiquitination site in sars-cov nsp16 has not been mapped and similar modifications of nsp16 in other coronaviruses have not been characterized also the physiological significance of nsp16 ubiquitination remains to be investigated using recombinant viruses under the setting of actual coronavirus infection apart from the structural and nonstructural proteins coronavirus genome also encodes various accessory proteins most of which share no homology to any known proteins these accessory proteins are dispensable for viral replication in cell culture in fact when the coding sequences of accessory proteins were deleted by reverse genetics the resulting recombinant viruses still replicated similarly to wild-type virus 159 however some of the coronavirus accessory proteins are incorporated in mature virions while others have been implicated in the modulation of host immune response and in vivo pathogenesis 159 only a few coronavirus accessory proteins are known to be modified by ptms figure 6  table 1 apart from the s protein some betacoronaviruses also encode the he protein which forms homodimers and constitutes a second type of shorter projections on the virion surface 10 similar to s protein the he protein of mhv was also found to be modified by n-linked glycosylation which was inhibited by tunicamycin but not monensin 160 the he protein of bcov was also shown to be glycosylated when expressed using a human adenovirus vector 161 the importance of n-linked glycosylation for the function of coronavirus he protein has not been fully characterized interestingly although sars-cov m protein is n-linked glycosylated its accessory protein 3a is o-linked glycosylated 162 the sars-cov protein 3a and m share the same n-exoc-endo membrane topology and both proteins contain three tm domains 163 o-linked glycans of the sars-cov protein 3a were resistant to the treatment of pngase f and pulse-chase analysis suggested that the oligosaccharides were acquired post-translationally 162 protein 3a has been implicated in modulating host immune response such as upregulating fibrinogen expression 164 and production of proinflammatory cytokines 165 however whether o-linked glycosylation contributes to the immune-modulating activities of sars-cov protein 3a is not known in animal isolates and early human isolates the sgrna8 of sars-cov encoded a single protein 8ab however in later human isolates during the peak of sars-cov epidemic a 29-nt deletion in the center split orf8 into two smaller orfs encoding proteins 8a and 8b respectively 166 whereas protein 8ab is co-translationally imported into the er and is n-linked glycosylated at n81 protein 8b is synthesized in the cytosol and not modified 167 both proteins 8b and 8ab were shown to interact with mono-ubiquitin and polyubiquitin and both were also modified by ubiquitination however whereas glycosylation at n81 stabilized protein 8ab and protected it from proteasomal degradation protein 8b was highly unstable and underwent rapid proteasomal degradation 168 the ubiquitinated 8b and 8ab may mediate rapid degradation of irf3 and regulate host antiviral innate immunity 169 the accessory protein 3b of tgev is encoded between the s and m genes in the purdue strain but it is truncated in some lab-passaged strains tgev 3b protein is translated via an internal entry mechanism possibly in conjunction with leaky scanning 170 in cells infected with the purdue strain of tgev two forms of 3b protein were detected a 31 kda n-glycosylated membrane-associated form and a 20 kda nonglycosylated soluble form 171 the tgev 3b protein was not essential for viral replication and was not incorporated in mature virion its role in pathogenesis is not completely understood although deletion of orf3b was found in some naturally attenuated tgev strains such as miller m60 172 coronavirus encodes one or two plpro in the nsp3 which carry out the proteolytic cleavage that releases nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 from the polyprotein 15173174 apart from its protease activity sars-cov plpro was also shown to possess deubiquitinating dub activity 175176 which was also identified later for plp2 of hcov-nl63 177 and mhv-a59 178 as well as plpro of mers-cov 179180 and ibv 181 structural studies revealed that sars-cov plpro shared similar fold with known dub enzymes but exhibited several distinct features 182 later studies showed that apart from ubiquitin the plpro of sars-cov and mers-cov also recognized another ubiquitin-like modifier interferon-stimulated gene 15 isg15 and served as a deisgylating enzyme 179180183 interestingly the dubdeisgylating activity of coronavirus plpro could be separated from its protease activity the crystal structure of sars-cov plpro in complex with human ubiquitin analog has been determined and certain mutations in the interacting regions were shown to compromise ubiquitin binding without affecting the protease activity of plpro 184 similarly using the structure of mers-cov plpro in complex with ub as a guide mutations were introduced into plpro that specifically disrupted the dub function without affecting its proteolytic activity unlike wild-type plpro the dub lacking variants were deficient in suppressing ifn promoter activation 185 in terms of biochemistry plpro from different coronaviruses seems to have slightly different substrate specificities and enzyme properties sars-cov plpro greatly prefers k48-linked to k63-linked ubiquitin chains the specificity of sars-cov plpro toward polyubk48 was proposed to be determined by its extended conformation and binding via two contact sites 186 in contrast the plpro of mers-cov cleaves polyub chains with broad linkage specificity also whereas mers-cov plpro cleaves polyub chains one ub at a time sars-cov plpro cleaves k48-linked polyub chain in a di-distributive manner  that is removing a di-ub moiety at a time 187 since ubiquitination and isgylation are critical for signaling transduction of innate immunity the dub and deisgylating activities of coronavirus plpro are well characterized as antagonists of host antiviral response figure 7 188 initial studies identified sars-cov plpro as a potent ifn antagonist by interacting with irf3 and inhibiting its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation thereby blocking type i ifn production 189 subsequently it was found that sars-cov plpro could also inhibit tnf-induced nf-b activation 190 and blocked the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in activated cells 179 the ifn antagonist activity of coronavirus plpro can be mediated by multiple mechanisms which may or may not involve its protease and dub activities 191 plp2 of mhv-a59 was found to directly deubiquitinate irf3 and prevent its nuclear translocation 178 it also deubiquitinated upstream tbk1 and reduced its kinase activity thereby inhibiting ifn signaling 192 plpro of sars-cov was shown to remove k63-linked ubiquitin chains from traf3 and traf6 thereby suppressing the activation of tbk1 in cells treated with tlr7 agonist 193 alternatively membrane-anchored sars-cov plpro might physically interact with the sting-traf3-tbk1 complex to inhibit the phosphorylation and dimerization of irf3 thereby suppressing the stingtbk1ikk-mediated activation of type i ifn 194195 at last using a constitutively active phosphor-mimetic irf3 it was recently shown that the dub activity of plpro also inhibited irf3 at a postactivation step 196 apart from the most well-characterized dubdeisgylation activities of coronavirus plpro other coronavirus proteins have also been implicated in regulating ptms of host proteins figure 7 for example in addition to the dub activity encoded in the nsp3 of sars-cov its sars-unique domain sud can also enhance a cellular e3 ubiquitin ligase called ring-finger and rchy1 which leads to proteasomal degradation of p53 197 cellular p53 inhibits replication of sars-cov and hcov-nl63 presumably by activating genes involved in innate immunity thus by targeting p53 for rchy1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation the sud of nsp3 may contribute to the pathogenesis of sars-cov 197 similarly sars-cov orf9b was found to localize to mitochondria and induce ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of drp1 leading to the elongation of mitochondrial it might also hijack a ubiquitin e3 ligase called aip4 to trigger the degradation of mavs traf3 and traf6 thereby significantly suppressing ifn responses 198 on the other hand ubiquitination of some cellular proteins is suppressed by coronavirus proteins trim25 is an e3 ubiquitin ligase that associates with and activates rig-i by mediating its ubiquitination the n protein of sars-cov was found to bind to the spry domain of trim25 and inhibit trim25-dependent rig-i activation thereby suppressing the type i ifn production induced by polyic or sendai virus 199 similarly the accessory protein 6 of sars-cov was shown to interact with the ifn-signaling pathway-mediating protein nmi and promote its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation thereby potentially modulating the virus-induced innate immune response 200 the enzymatic activity of some nonstructural proteins can directly modify some host proteins for example porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov nsp5 was shown to mediate the cleavage of nf-b essential modulator at glutamine 231 thereby significantly inhibiting ifn- production induced by sendai virus infection 201 later it was shown that the nsp5 of pdcov also cleaved stat2 and impaired its ability to induce the expression of isgs 202 therefore pdcov nsp5 mediates the cleavage of key players to inhibit both the production and signaling of type i interferons accumulating evidence suggests that coronavirus proteins are subjected to various ptms by the host cells transmembrane structural proteins s e and m nonstructural proteins nsp3 and nsp4 and accessory proteins sars-cov 3a are modified by glycosylation although glycosylation of coronavirus s protein is essentially n-linked the m proteins of lineage a betacoronavirus adopt the special o-linked glycans while the m proteins of other coronaviruses are modified by n-linked glycosylation some coronavirus s and e proteins acquire palmitoylation in the cytosolic cysteine residues while the n protein is mainly phosphorylated by multiple host kinases the conserved types and sites of ptms on these proteins suggest that co-option of ptms to regulate coronavirus proteins has a long evolutionary history while the diversity of ptms on numerous coronavirus proteins highlights their important implication in viral replication and pathogenesis ptms contribute significantly to the functions of coronavirus proteins apart from facilitating the folding and intracellular trafficking of the coronavirus s protein n-linked glycans also constitute a significant part of the protein mass and profoundly affect the conformation of the mature s protein and its binding to surface receptors n-linked glycans may play a role in the antigenicity of s protein and glycosylation may also contribute to the induction of innate immune response thereby affecting the viral pathogenesis phosphorylation of coronavirus n protein improves its selective binding to viral rna and may regulate the uncoating and assembly process during replication importantly the phosphorylation status of mhv-jhm n protein controlled by the host kinase gsk-3 acts as a switch to regulate genome replicationtranscription although a similar mechanism has not been described for other coronaviruses coronavirus also employ multiple mechanisms to interfere with ptms of host proteins in particular the dub and deisgylating activities encoded by nsp3 suppress the induction and signaling of type i interferons the functional implication of ptms on many coronavirus proteins has not been fully characterized and their biological significance requires further investigations combining reverse genetics and suitable in vivo models however the presence of multiple modification sites on some functionally important domains of a protein as examplified by the presence of more than 20 predicted n-linked glycosylation sites on various functional domains of coronavirus s protein and multiple phosphorylation sites in coronavirus n protein and the absence of sensitive and specific methods for detection of individual ptms in live cells and infectious particles have hindered further investigation into the function of ptms at a specific site of a coronavirus protein in virus replication and pathogenesis in addition it appears that the functional effect of mutation at a canonical site can be compensated by the same ptm at an alternate site this is especially true for proteins with multiple sites for a certain ptm such as n-linked glycosylation of s protein and phosphorylation of n protein with the advent of innovative labeling techniques such as h2o18 labeling and the ever-growing capacity of mass spectrometry systematic identification of conventional and novel ptm will be greatly accelerated over the next decade also as we better understand the detailed molecular mechanisms behind ptms functional studies will shift from relying on less specific inhibitors to targeted depletion of key modifying enzymes using gene knockdownknockout approaches based on crispr technologies assisted by the exquisite structural and biochemical investigation of plpro and other coronavirus proteins future studies will further reveal the mechanisms of how these proteins interfere with host ptms and modulate viral pathogenesis undoubtedly coronavirus reverse genetics will remain the cornerstone for characterizing the biological significance of ptms in coronavirus proteins which will also be facilitated by the recent development of various transgenic in vivo models in terms of translational applications ptms of coronavirus proteins and the interference of ptms of host proteins by coronavirus proteins may be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention for instance carbohydrate binding agents that directly interact with glycans on the virion surface may be able to suppress virus attachment and entry as more than one n-linked glycosylation sites are present multiple mutations will be required for the virus to develop drug resistance on the other hand recombinant coronaviruses with the dubdeisgylation activity specifically deleted from plpro may be desirable vaccine candidates as these viruses will retain the protease activity required for replication but become substantially attenuated as they are defective in subverting the host innate immune response given its importance in both veterinary setting and public healthcare a better understanding of the ptms of coronavirus proteins will provide new insights into the development of more efficient vaccines and novel antivirals  antigenic evolution on global scale reveals potential natural selection of sars-cov-2 by pre-existing cross-reactive t cell immunity chengdong zhang xuanxuan jin xianyang chen qibin leng tianyi qiu  the mutation pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is constantly changing with the places of transmission but the reason remains to be revealed here we presented the study that comprehensively analyzed the potential selective pressure of immune system restriction which can drive mutations in circulating sars-cov-2 isolates the results showed that the most common mutation sites of sars-cov-2 proteins were located on the non-structural protein orf1ab and the structural protein spike further analysis revealed mutations in cross-reactive epitopes between sars-cov-2 and seasonal coronavirus may help sars-cov-2 to escape cellular immunity under the long-term and large-scale community transmission meanwhile the mutations on spike protein may enhance the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter the host cells and escape the recognition of b-cell immunity this study will increase the understanding of the evolutionary direction and warn about the potential immune escape ability of sars-cov-2 which may provide important guidance for the potential vaccine design  the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epidemic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was stated in late december 2019 and now become worldwide pandemic 1 2  the whole-genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was first released on jan 2020 3 4 and followed by massive strain isolates derived from human patients shared in global initiative on sharing all influence data gisaid 5  coronaviruses covs are naturally host in vertebrate including birds swine cat multiple bats and human 6  based on our best knowledge there are 7 human-susceptible covs and among them hcov-229e hcov-hku1 hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 could only cause slight respiratory infections 7  on the contrary other three covs including mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 could cause serious clinical symptoms of fever cough dyspnea and pneumonia further may results in progressive respiratory failure and even death 3 8  previous research indicated that sars-cov-2 share only 50 identity with the mers-cov and 79 identity with the sars-cov 19  but share over 90 similarity with a bat sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov ratg13 collected in yunnan china 3 10  the rapid accumulation of the whole-genome sequence 1 5 illustrated that the mutations are already observed in both structure and non-structure proteins including orf1ab envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n spike s orf3a orf6 orf7a and orf7b on sars-cov-2 even though the isolates share with over 99 identity 2  the mutations could lead to not only the occurrence of different subtypes 2  but also impact the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 11  however the driver of the mutations is still un-revealed and comprehensive investigation is needed to reveal the evolutionary pressure and virulent of the future types of sars-cov-2 the evolution of viruses was mainly affected by the population-level of epidemics which could allow the opportunities for viruses under evolutionary selective pressure by the immune system of its host 12  for example the new antigenic variants could be observed in every 3 to 5 years for influenza ah3n2 viruses under the selective pressure of the antibody mediated humoral immunity 12  on the other hand as an essential part of human immune system cellular immunity could response to the viral infectious through t-cell and human leukocyte antigen hla 13  unlike humoral immunity which is majorly targeting the main antigen protein the viruses the hla could recognize the t-cell epitope of the whole genome including structure and non-structure proteins moreover hla could present the t-cell epitope to the surface of the antigen presenting cell apc and further binding with the t-cell receptors tcrs to trigger the immune response 13  the long-term symbiosis of virus and its host will lead to hla mediated cellular immunity and accelerate the evolution of virus in multiple cases such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis d virus hdv 14 15  although sars-cov-2 is a new emerging pathogen seasonal hcovs had been circulating in community for a long time currently multiple works suggesting the existence of cross-reactive t-cell recognitions between circulating seasonal hcovs and sars-cov-2 16 17 18  thus the long-term community transmission of seasonal hcovs may also drove the rapid evolution of sars-cov-2 under the selective pressure of the immune system in this work a comprehensive analysis of the sars-cov-2 mutants and the potential binding affinity of t-cell epitopes were provided based on current released mutation strains especially for the mutations on orf1ab which could alter the binding affinity of cross-reactive peptides between seasonal hcovs and sars-cov-2 and the mutations on s protein which could enhance the binding affinity of ace2 and decrease the binding affinity of antibody the study presented in this work could not only provides a new insight into the factors driving the evolution of sars-cov-2 and its evolutionary pattern but also provide theoretical guidance for the vaccine and therapeutic antibody design till now the worldwide community spreading of sars-cov-2 could lead to the monitoring and responding of human immune system including hla mediated cellular immunity and b-cell receptor bcr mediated humoral immunity consistently to escape the acquired immune system the virus will be mutated under the selective pressure for cellular immunity both hla-i and hla-ii molecules presenting multiple alleles in different ethnicities the diversity of alleles will lead to the presentation of different peptides thus the hla mediated selective pressure is closely related to the spreading among various human races by taking benefit from the worldwide spreading of sars-cov-2 it is a great opportunity for us to reveal the immune system mediated selective pressure and the potential evolutionary direction of sars-cov-2 here we provided a comprehensive analysis in four levels including 1 mapping the mutations on the whole genome sequence of sars-cov-2 and deriving all potential t-cell epitopes ptes involving mutation sites figure 1a  2 analyzing the potential peptides based on the circulating regions of viruses worldwide and the local dominant alleles figure 1b  3 revealing the selective pressure of hla through cross-reactive peptides crps between seasonal hcovs and sars-cov-2  figure  1c  and 4 evaluating the binding affinity of s protein mutants against human ace2 and binding antibody figure 1d  results indicated that 1 the mutations were occurred in the whole genome of sars-cov-2 including all structure and non-structure proteins the most frequent mutation sites are in the structure protein of spike s and the non-structure protein of orf1ab 2 the frequent mutation sites and strains were discovered in countries such as the united states the united kingdom which have suffered from long-term and large-scale community transmissions 3 the crps between seasonal hcovs and sars-cov-2 on orf1ab trend to mutate towards the direction of escape from immune response by reducing the binding affinity against both hla-i and hla-ii and 4 the mutations of spike protein could enhance the ability to enter the host cells by increase the binding affinity of ace2 moreover escape the surveillance of humoral immunity by decrease the binding affinity of binding antibody  till may 20 th  2020 we observed 4420 mutation sites on 10 structure and non-structure proteins including orf1ab spike s orf3a envelope e membrane m orf6 orf7a orf8 nucleocapsid n and orf10 figure 2a  the conserved regions of all above proteins could be determined by the identify conserved domains icd tools in ncbi 19  results showed that orf1ab s orf3a m orf7a orf8 and n contain both conserved and non-conserved area among them orf1ab and s protein contains the most frequent mutation sites with mutation frequency over 06 figure 2a  which indicating the potential immune pressure mediated evolution the mutation frequency and counts of each residues could be found in supplementary table 1  it can be noted that orf1ab is the largest non-structural polyprotein of sars-cov-2 which could trigger the cellular immunity by divided peptides presented by hla molecules s protein is the major protein target in humoral immunity which is mutated under the pressure of bcr or antibodies further we counted the continent-specific mutation sites and found the most frequent mutations occurred on s protein orf1ab n protein and orf3a with 9 sites mutated over 200 times 5 sites mutated over 800 times and 2 sites mutated over 9000 times among top 5 mutations d614g on s protein is counted for 9780 times followed by p4715l on orf1ab 9745 times r203k on n protein 2866 times p5828l on orf1ab 1021 times and g251v on orf3a 859 times detailed information of all mutation sites can be found in supplementary table 2  more interestingly the most frequently mutated sites were detected from strains circulating in northern america and the europe which are two major epidemic regions with long-time and large-population transmission of sars-cov-2 for example d614g mutations on s protein were counted for 2950 times and 3071 times in the united states and the united kingdom respectively as well as the p4715l mutations on orf1ab which were counted for 2958 and 3070 times in the united states and the united kingdom respectively supplementary table 3  the frequent mutations on s protein and orf1ab might be caused by the selective pressure of humoral immunity and cellular immunity after the long-term large-scale community transmission of covid-19 results illustrated that most of the mutations on potential t-cell epitopes ptes didnt shift the predicted binding affinity supplementary table 4   supplementary table 5  for mutations which alter the binding affinity weak to strong peptides wsps are significantly higher than strong to weak peptides swps as been illustrated in figure 2a  the number of wsps are higher than swps for both hla-i and hla-ii ptes on most of the non-structure and structure proteins contains on the contrary for s protein the number of swps are 22 times and 18 times higher than wsps for both hla-i and hla-ii ptes respectively hla mediated immune pressure could promote the evolution of cross-reactive epitopes between seasonal covs and sars-cov-2 moreover we derived the cross-reactive epitopes cres between seasonal human coronavirus hcovs and sars-cov-2 for further analysis see methods the infection of seasonal hcovs are ubiquitous and could cause slight symptoms such as common cold 7 22 23  epidemiological data indicating an average of two episodes of common cold per year in the adult population which extrapolated that hcovs could infected adults in every two to three years 24  the consistent transmission of hcovs in human population could maintain the immune memory and produce selective pressure for the cres between hcovs and sars-cov-2 here we detected the cres between hcovs and sars-cov-2 which might already be circulated across the community before the epidemic of covid-19 by matching the information of original infectious regions with the dominant hla-ihla-ii alleles 197358 alleles and 9327943 peptides which covering 1311 nations in 74 continents were derived for further analysis for each cres the binding affinity of hla-ihla-ii with the corresponding alleles were predicted by iebd it can be found that the number of wsps is 16 times than swps on orf1ab for all peptides involving mutations supplementary table 6  however the number of cres illustrated opposite results in which cross-reactive swps are significantly higher than those of wsps on all 6 continents including north america europe south asia east asia southeast asia and oceania figure 2c  for example the results in north america showed that cross-reactive hla-i swps 34800 are 201 times than wsps 1733 similar results could also be found for europe south asia east asia southeast asia and oceania in which the number of cross-reactive hla-i swps are 175 to 4 times than those wsps the swps with counting number of 10 can be found in supplementary table 7  for hla-ii cres could only be detected in north american europe east asia and south asia which illustrated the same phenomenon here 2206 cross-reactive hla-ii swps were detected 4 times than those wsps 546 for north america europe and east asia the number of cross-reactive hla-ii swps are 24 times to 194 times than those wsps on the contrary we detected 13 cross-reactive hla-ii wsps in the data of south asia which is higher than the number of swps as 2 this might be due to the fact the small amount of sequence submitted from south asia in current time the s protein of the sars-cov-2 is the major target for the humoral immunity and the receptor-binding domain rbd of s protein could mediate the attachment of viruses to the surface receptors in host cell 25 26 27  thus under the selective pressure of both sides the s protein was mutated frequently here we evaluate the mutations on s protein specifically on the ace2 binding domain and the epitopes for antibody the 3-d structures of three mutants with mutation in ace2 binding domain including r408i n439k g476s  figure xx  and four mutants with mutation in epitope regions including k378r h519p h519q r408i figure 2d were constructed by homology modeling 28  further the binding affinities between corresponding mutants and ace2 29 or antibody cr3022 30 were calculated through molecular docking 31  the rbd region of sars-cov-2 isolate wuhan-hu-1mn9089473 was selected as reference for control as been illustrated in figure 2d  the mutants of r408i n439k and g476s could promote the binding capacity between rbd region and ace2 compared with reference among them arginine r and lysine k are alkaline amino acids the mutations of r to isoleucine i and asparagine n to k involving significant property changes further investigation illustrated the potential binding site for n439k is the acidic amino acids glutamicacid in 329e which could form an ionic bond to increase the binding capacity between rbd and ace2 figure 2d  moreover the potential binding site for r408i is the alkaline amino acid of histidine h the mutations of r408i might reduce the repulsive force between two alkaline amino acids of h and r figure 2d  on the contrary the mutations of k378r h519p h519q r408i could decrease the binding capacity of antibody cr3022 among them only k378r didnt involving huge property changes since k and r are both alkaline amino acids other three are both alkaline amino acids mutated to uncharged residues it could be observed that 408r could form an ionic bond with the asparticacid d in 54d on the h chain after r mutated to i the ionic bond will be broken to reduce the binding capacity of the antibody above results indicated that the mutations on the rbd of s protein might enhance the ability of virus to target the ace2 receptor and further promote the capacity of virus to invade host cell moreover the mutations on rbd hold the potential to decrease the binding ability of antibodies and lead to immune escape of the virus at present the global pandemic of sars-cov-2 immeasurably impact the human health and economic development worldwide thus revealing the evolutionary pattern would be extremely helpful for the disease prevention and vaccine design in this article we comprehensively analysis the mutation pattern based on the largest available dataset of mutations to reveal the evolution direction and potential drivers of sars-cov-2 results showed that the mutations could cause more wsps than swps on the whole genome however for cross-reactive peptide between seasonal hcovs and sars-cov-2 the number of swps are significantly higher than wsps on orf1ab indicating the potential natural selection of sars-cov-2 by pre-existing cross-reactive t cell immunity further the analysis on s protein illustrated that the evolution of sars-cov-2 was more likely to be more infective by increase the binding affinity of ace2 and escape the surveillance of the immune system by reduce the binding affinity of the corresponding antibody since dec 2019 the sars-cov-2 has spread to over 200 countries or regions in six months and maintained the continuous transmission so far the long terms community transmission in different regions and races will make sars-cov-2 under different the types of immune pressure as a typical rna virus those selective pressure will drove the frequent mutations of sars-cov-2 moreover according to our results this evolution may have certain directionality towards immune escape currently nations such as united states united kingdom and china are suffering from the epidemic and are the high incidence areas of sars-cov-2 it can be observed that the long-term and large-scale community transmission in these countries makes the existential time of weak binding peptides longer than strong binding peptides it is suggested that the sars-cov-2 in those countries may have the evolutionary direction of reducing the immunogenicity of t-cell epitopes furthermore we systematically analyzed the mutation of cres between sars-cov-2 and seasonal hcovs the results showed that although the number of swps and wsps in the mutations of whole genome peptides are not significantly different from each other however swps in the mutations of cres had an overwhelming number over wsps in tens or even hundreds of times since adults will be infected with seasonal hcovs every two to three years 7  seasonal hcovs have already been spread with in large-scale of population in a long-term therefore the mutations of cres in sars-cov-2 will evolved towards the direction of immune escape finally we analyzed the target protein spike of the b-cell immunity and found that the s protein of sars-cov-2 can not only enhance the binding affinity with human receptor ace2 by form a new ionic bond through mutation such as n439k but also reduce the binding affinity of antibody cr3022 by destroying the ionic bond through mutation r408i this result suggests that s protein has an evolutionary trend to increase infectious ability and escape immune monitoring under b-cell immune pressure according to a latest research of the sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics 18  sars-cov-2 is more likely to spread much longer than we expected this research points out that if the immune response for sars-cov-2 infections are long-term or even life-time effective the epidemic may end in year 2021 however if the immune memory is short-term effective such as 40 weeks to 104 weeks the risk of annual or periodic eruption in every two or three years is existed like the seasonal hcovs consistently our research indicated that rapid mutations of sars-cov-2 may trend to escape from the monitoring and recognition of the immune system this means that even if the effective vaccine could be developed for current circulating sars-cov-2 the rapid immune escape trend mutations will cause the ineffective of vaccine in a short time thus we may expect the vaccine development become a cyclical work for sars-cov-2 in the future just like the case of influenza virus in this circumstance monitoring the mutations and antigenic evolution of sars-cov-2 timely will be a very important task the reference amino acid sequences of sars-cov-2 mn9089473 and four human susceptible seasonal covs including hcov-229e nc0026451 hcov-hku1 nc0065772 hcov-nl63 nc0058312 and hcov-oc43 nc0062131 were derived from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi 32  the mutant information gff3 files of 10 structure and non-structure proteins including spike protein envelope protein nucleocapsid protein membrane protein orf1ab protein orf3a ofr6 orf7a orf8 and orf10 were derived from the national genomics data center 33 till may 20 th  2020 for mutation analysis of the whole protein sequence we extended the indel positions to the reference sequence to obtain a more precise mutation frequency for each amino acid point for ease of k-mer analysis all non-mismatch mutations are excluded which left 4420 mutation sites for downstream analysis frequency of alleles in different countries and regions were obtained from allele frequency net database afnd 34  for each country and region only those alleles with frequency over 005 and population over 25 were retained mutant peptide preparation for each mutation site  compared with reference sequence wuhan-hu-1mn9089473 the sequence from site   1 5 to  1 5 was derived from the corresponding protein sequence of the mutants further it will be divided into peptides with the sliding windows of 8-mer to 15-mer and searching step of 1-mer among all peptides those contain the mutation site  was retained as the mutant epitopes cross-reactive epitope preparation each of the mutant peptide of sars-cov-2 was compared against all four seasonal covs using in-house python script the cross-reactive epitopes were defined as those peptides that are identical to the k-mer sequence in at least one of the seasonal covs both the hla-i and hla-ii binding affinities between hla alleles and k-mer peptides were predicted by the t cell epitope prediction tools standalone version 2223 with iedb immune epitope database recommended methods 21 20  for hla i alleles 8-14 mer peptides were analyzed and were considered strong binding peptides with a cutoff  001 35  for hla ii alleles only 15 mer peptides were analyzed and a consensus percentile rank of the top 10 was considered strong binding peptide 36  the allele-peptide pairs with prediction score lager than the cutoff was considered weak binding peptides the total number of strong or weak binders were determined by the combination of strains and alleles  evolving geographic diversity in sars-cov2 and in silico analysis of replicating enzyme 3clpro targeting

january 2020 the world health organisation who reported cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause in wuhan city hubei province of china and by 30 january 2020 who escalated the warning to public health emergency of international concern by 12 march 2020 the novel coronavirus ncov outbreak achieved a global pandemic status and was recognised as novel covid-19 disease ncovid-19 1 the present coronavirus outbreak is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 sars-cov-2 phylogeny and taxonomy designated 2 worldometer reported the total sars-cov-2 infected cases on 31 may 2020 as 6238550 and deaths 374374 worldwide httpswwwworldometersinfocoronaviruscountries the pathogen has been established to transmit from human to human contact and has quickly spread to more than 187 countries across the globe httpsgisanddatamapsarcgiscom coronaviruses are single and positive stranded rna viruses belonging to the genus coronavirus of the family coronaviridae that can cause acute and chronic respiratory and central nervous system illnesses in animals including in humans 3 4 the infection can also cause mild episodes of follicular conjunctivitis in certain patients in animal models the infection has been shown to induce anterior uveitis retinitis and optic neuritis like symptoms 5 recent study has shown formation of hyper-reflective lesions in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers of the retina particularly around the papillomacular bundles 6 the disease has also been shown to affect sense of smell and taste bud sensitivity in patients 7 all coronaviruses have a minimum of 3 basic viral proteins i an envelope protein e which is a highly hydrophobic protein involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle such as assembly and envelope formation 8 ii a spike protein s a glycoprotein involved in receptor recognition and membrane fusion 9 and iii a membrane protein m which plays a key role in virion assembly 10 fig 1 the viral genome also encodes two open reading frames orf orfa and orfb that activate intracellular pathways and triggers the host innate immune response 11 the polyprotein encoded by the virus are initially processed by two main viral proteases which include a papain-like cysteine protease plpro and chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known as 3c-like protease 3clpro into intermediate and mature non-structural proteins 12 the main proteinase 3clpro is one of the primary targets for development in an antiviral drug therapies as it plays a critical role in the viral replication 13 k11777 camostat and est are cysteine protease inhibitors which have been shown to inhibit sars-cov 3clpro replication in cell culture conditions 14 15 recent release of the high-resolution crystal structure for the main proteinase 3clpro protein data bank pdb id 6y2g describing an additional amide bond with the -ketoamide inhibitor pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma 16 is suggested to accelerate the targeted drug discovery efforts two hiv-1 proteinase inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir have been considered to target sars-cov 17 interestingly the substrate binding cleft is located between domains i and ii of both sars-cov 3clpro and sars-cov-2 3clpro enzymes 16 18 since the initial stages of the sars-cov-2 outbreak laboratories and hospitals around the world have sequenced viral genome data with unprecedented speed enabling real-time understanding of this novel disease process which will hopefully contribute to the development of novel candidate drugs the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 from all over the world have been deposited at the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid 19 database and more sequences continue to be deposited with the passage of time development of a novel vaccine against sars-cov-2 so far remains elusive and requires a thorough understanding of molecular changes in viral genetics this may be attained by freely accessing the gisaid database and processing the data to enhance our understanding of the fine biochemical and genetic differences that differentiate this virus from the previously known strains 20 it is well known that viruses are non-living and that they require host cells to survive and to reproduce with the sole aim to perpetuate themselves when a virus jumps from animal to human it is termed a zoonotic virus this occurred during the sars outbreak of 2002 when a new coronavirus spread around the world and resulted in death of hundreds of people 21 in 2012 another novel coronavirus outbreak termed middle east respiratory syndrome mers caused over 400 fatalities and spread to over 20 different countries 22 there are currently many circulating viruses but why sars-cov-2 has achieved such a devastating pandemic status and whether this pandemic will subside remain unanswered the purpose of this study is to characterise known viral variants that have spread across different countries especially hot-spot regions with a focus on recurrent mutations in south american and african geographical regions we also focused on the sars-cov-2 main proteinase 3clpro which is highly conserved in most of the coronaviruses and has been suggested to be a potential drug target to fight against ncovid-19 repurposed drugs such as flavonoids and biflavanoids known anti-malarial and anti-viral drugs and the inhibitory effects of vitamins could selectively inhibit this enzyme and can be used either alone or in combination with other disease management approaches to suppress the virulence of sars-cov-2 these bioinformatics computational modelling and molecular docking approaches using repurposed drugs could be particularly useful in the current ncovid-19 outbreak the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data gisaid is headquartered in munich germany and is a publicprivate partnership project between german government and the non-profit organization founded by leading medical researchers in 2006 since december 2019 gisaid has become a repository storage database for ncovid-19 genome the genome analysis was carried out for data deposited up to 31 may 2020 httpswwwgisaidorg severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 wuhan genome was collected from ncbi nc0455122 multiple sequence alignment msa of all nucleotide sequences were carried out in the embl-ebi clustal omega server to investigate sequence conservation 23 24 the newick format for the multiple align sequence was used to generate phylogeny 25 the phylogenetic tree was constructed in the interactive tree of life itol online tool 26 the itol server generate phylogeny trees in a circular radial and normal standard trees the circular trees can be rooted and displayed in different arc sizes 2729 crystal structure of sars and sars-cov-2 3clpro with bound inhibitors were collected from the protein data bank pdb 30 pdb id 3tnt sars main protease was selected as reference to analyse the variants in sars-cov-2 3clpro pdb id 6y2g all the pdbs were visualised using ucsf chimera software 31 multiple alignment ribbon surface and superimposition module in chimera software were used for analysis and image generation 24 32 the dataset comprises of flavones and biflavanoids anti-viral anti-malarial and vitamins as sars-cov-2 3clpro inhibitors 16 in total 17 repurposed drugs were collected from the pubchem database 33 two-dimensional 2d structures were downloaded from the pubchem database insdf format the inhibitor energies were minimized using the austin model-1 am1 until the root mean square rms gradient value became smaller than 0100 kcalmol  and later re-optimization was done by mopac molecular orbital package method 34 35 later all the inhibitors were converted topdb format in open babel software 36 and submitted to molecular docking studies crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 3clpro was retrieved from pdb pdb id 6y2g the protein macromolecule sars-cov-2 3clpro optimization was carried out in ucsf chimera software 31 37 38 by adding polar hydrogen atoms removing water molecules implying amber parameters followed by minimization with the mmtk method in 500 steps with a step size of 002  sars-cov-2 3clpro contained chain a and b of 306 amino acids sequence length chain a of pdb id 6y2g containing alpha-ketoamide o6k inhibitor was used for identification of substrate binding site the docking of sars-cov-2 3clpro specific pharmacological inhibitors into the catalytic site was performed by the autodock 42 program 39 the alpha-ketoamide o6k inhibitor was extracted from the sars-cov-2 3clpro protein the polar hydrogen atoms were added the non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged gasteiger charges were assigned and solvation parameters were added to the protease sars-cov-2 3clpro protein the protonation state for all inhibitors and o6k were set to physiological ph and rotatable bonds of the ligands were set to be free the autogrid program was also used to generate grid maps cys145 residue in the sars-cov-2 3clpro protein was selected with grid box dimensions of 40  40  40  formed around the cys145 protease residue which is present in the substrate binding site protein rigid docking was performed using the empirical free energy function together with the lamarckian genetic algorithm lga 40 lga default parameters were used in each docking procedure and 10 different poses were calculated chimera and discovery studio ds visualizer25 31 software were used for visualisation and calculation of proteinligand interactions a total of 9761 sars-cov-2 genomes were retrieved from the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg that contain 3 sequences from bat betacoronavirus and 9 sequences from malayan pangolin manis javanica additional file 1 table s1 out of 9761 genome sequences 2301 complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were selected randomly aligned and compared with wuhan sars-cov-2 nc0455122 reference genome we have divided our dataset into 6 different geographic areas europe 2031 north america 2113 asia 3537 oceania 2086 south america 1663 and africa 1035 the european group comprises of sars-cov-2 infected patient data from the following countries austria belgium czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany greece hungary iceland ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg netherlands poland portugal slovakia slovenia spain sweden switzerland and united kingdom the north american group contains genomes from the united states and canada the asian group comprises genomes obtained from patients located in china indonesia pakistan philippines taiwan turkey kuwait georgia south korea japan iran india thailand hong kong malaysia singapore and vietnam the oceanian group comprises genomes from australia and new zealand south america includes brazil peru chile colombia argentina and ecuador fig 2ac sequences from bat-sars-cov and pangolin-sars-cov were aligned and compared to the wuhan sars-cov-2 nc0455122 as a reference genome to determine the evolutionary relationship among bat-cov pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 we estimated a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence bat-sars-cov and sars-cov-2 were grouped together and were observed to share  96 similarity whereas the pangolin-sars-cov was closest evolutionary ancestor fig 2d isolate of human wuhan sars-cov-2 nc0455122 shared 8598 identity with pangolin-sars-cov which suggests that pangolin may be associated with sars-cov-2 evolution or subsequent outbreak 41 42 recently pachetti et al 43 has reported eight novel recurrent mutations of sars-cov-2 that have been identified in positions 1397 2891 14408 17746 17857 18060 23403 and 28881 in asian oceanic european and north american outbreaks however sars-cov-2 mutations from south american and african patient isolates are not yet reported we confirmed the occurrence of these mutations in south americans and africans located at positions 3036 8782 1108314408 23403 28144 and 28881 as reported in previous literature 43 our study highlights the presence of additional conserved mutations in the south american and african communities considering only those occurring  5 times in our database we report here 12 new mutations that have evolved in the sars-cov2 sequence in south american and african populations these are located at positions 14805 25563 26144 28882 28883 9477 28657 28863 1059 15324 28878 and 29742 sites the high tendency of the virus to demonstrate genetic variability is evident from the fact that even within these variants three variations 9477 nsp4 28657 and 28863 orf9 structural protein were uniquely identified in isolates from south american patients while four novel mutations viz 1059 nsp2 15324 rdrp 28878 orf9 structural protein and 29742 stem-loop ii-like motif were detected only in isolates from african patient samples fig 3b interestingly some mutations were identified to be common between these two separate sets of sequences that have been reported from the two distinct geographical locations viz 14805 25563 26144 28882 and 28883 belonging to gene orf1ab 14805 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp orf3a 25563 and 26144 orf3a protein and orf9 n gene 28882 and 28883 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein sequences respectively fig 3a an interesting finding of this analysis is the concurrence of 14805 mutation with 14808 mutation in the same locus this double point mutation was observed in rdrp genome from isolates of both south american and african patients in contrast 2888228883 mutation locus corresponded with another previously reported mutation 28881 and this triple point mutation was also present in both the south american and african genomic sequences identification of point mutations at the same locus indicates the high susceptibility of these genetic regions to change as the virus evolves for its actions single-stranded sars-cov-2 rna viral genome encodes two protease polyproteins i papain-like cysteine-protease plpro and ii the chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known as 3c-like protease 3clpro 3clpro which is a main protease and therefore important in order to examine the incidence of any mutation in sars-cov-2 3clpro multiple sequence alignment of the sars-cov-2 genome collected from patients in six different geographical locations exhibited 100 similarity and no discernible variations in sequences obtained from diverse geographical regions for this enzyme sars and sars-cov-2 complete genomes were collected from ncbi genbank database nc004718 and nc045512 protease nucleotide sequences were extracted from sars nc004718 and were aligned with sars-cov-2 nc045512 clustal omega alignment of 918 sars nucleotides showed around 95 similarity with sars-cov-2 additional file 2 table s2 higher amino acid sequence identity was also observed in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 main protease 3clpro derived from wuhan and us patients sars-cov and sars-cov-2 3clpro showed highly conserved region in both the catalytic sites his41 and cys145 44 and substrate binding region of the enzyme 163-167 and 187-192 45 fig 4a inferring that these proteases exhibit high similarities furthermore 12 variant positions thr35val ala46ser ser65asn leu86val arg88lys ser94ala his134phe lys180asn leu202val ala267ser thr285ala and ile286leu were observed in sars-cov-2 3clpro fig 4b c the effects of mutations and potential resultant amino acids on sars-cov-2 3clpro structure are expected to conserve the polarity and hydrophobicity except when the resulting amino acid is leucine at 286 position however it is important to mention that these 12 variants are not present in catalytic and substrate binding regions which are involved in critical proteolytic activity of the sars-cov-2 protease molecule the sars-cov-2 3clpro receptor binding pocket was determined by superimposing sars and sars-cov-2 3clpro with their respective inhibitors fig 4 interestingly needleman-wunsch alignment algorithm and blosum-62 matrix analysis revealed 9444 sequence identity between sars fig 5a grey and sars-cov-2 3clpro fig 5a cyan cys-his catalytic dyad cys145 and his41 comprises the active catalytic binding site in sars-cov-2 3clpro fig 5a b and indicated the strong possibility that intended pharmacological inhibitors of sars-cov-2 3clpro may also suppress the activity of sars-cov-2 3clpro viral enzymes docking protocol for the autodock 42 program was optimized by extracting and re-docking the alpha-ketoamide inhibitor named o6k in the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 3clpro the lowest binding energy  645 kcalmol and 1872 m inhibitory constant ki was predicted for alpha-ketoamide inhibitor shown in table 1 re-docking of o6k inhibitor occupied the similar docking pose in the sars-cov-2 3clpro catalytic dyad active site as previously reported in the crystal structure pdb id 6y2g fig 5c d seven flavonoids and biflavonoid three anti-malarial compounds seven anti-viral drugs and three vitamin molecules were subjected to automated docking within the active site of sars-cov-2 3clpro catalytic-dyad the superimposition of all docked flavones and biflavones fig 6a anti-malarial drugs fig 6b anti-viral drugs fig 6c and vitamins fig 6d are shown in fig 6 and various binding parameter have been tabulated in detail in table 2 amentaflavone a biflavonoid showed the highest binding energy  849 kcalmol implicating a strong affinity with sars-cov-2 3clpro this corresponded with previously reported enzyme inhibitory assays with amentaflavone that showed the highest ic50 value at low concentrations of the molecule 83  12 m 46 however bilobetin demonstrated the lowest ic50 value at a higher concentration of 723  45 m in sars-cov enzyme activity assays 46 in contrast our docking studies revealed that bilobetin predicted almost comparable binding energy with that of amentaflavone  829 kcalmol suggesting that mutation in sars-cov-2 3clpro could potentially disrupt hydrogen bonding or induce some conformational change that could result in alterations in the binding site thus affecting inhibitor interactions with the enzyme active site residues amentaflavone showed h-bond interactions with the catalytic dyad residues cys145 and his41 as well as noteworthy interactions with the sars-cov-2 3clpro residues thr26 ser46 ser144 and glu166 whereas his164 and gln189 amino acids contributed to the hydrophobic interactions for the sars-cov-2 3clpro inhibitors fig 7a three antimalarial drugs were then selected to study their inhibitory actions on sars-cov-2 3clpro we found artemisinin a natural compound derived from chinese herb artemisia annua produces the highest docking score  640 kcalmol as compared to o6k chloroquine -495 kcalmol and hydroxychloroquine  577 kcalmol anti-malarial molecules importantly artemisinin has demonstrated broad anti-viral activity against human cytomegalovirus herpes simplex virus type 1 epstein-barr virus hepatitis b virus hepatitis c virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus 47 artemisinin was shown to exhibit hydrogen bonding with his41 leu141 asn142 gly143 ser144 and glu166 sars-cov-2 3clpro amino-acid residues fig 7b amongst the seven antiviral drugs ritonavir showed the highest binding energy -745 kcalmol and lowest inhibitory constant ki value 349 m ritonavir produced hydrogen bond interactions with thr26 his41 and cys145 sars-cov-2 amino acids fig 7c a combination of two hiv-1 protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir were given to critically ill sars-cov 2 infected patients 48 however the combination therapy of lopinavir and ritonavir was also stopped early in 13 patients total recruitment 99 patients due to associated gastrointestinal adverse events 48 the severity of antiviral therapy adverse events has led researchers to explore the potential of macro- micro- and phytonutrients that can potentially promote an immune response and suppress viral induced effects vitamins are known to modulate the host immune functions by providing anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory activity 49 50 therefore we selected vitamins ascorbic acid vitamin c cholecalciferol vitamin d and alpha-tocopherol vitamin e to investigate their potential interactions with the enzyme sars-cov-2 3clpro our docking results interestingly showed that vitamin d has the lowest binding energy and ki  775 kcalmol and 208 m respectively as compared to vitamin c and vitamin e amino acid residues thr24 thr26 his41 and cys145 of sars-cov-2 3clpro showed hydrogen bond formation with vitamin d fig 7d amino acid thr is extensively involved in intracellular signalling changes through phosphorylation changes and here we observed that cholecalciferol formed a strong hydrogen bond with thr residues and could potentially block the phosphorylation of thr residue in sars-cov-2 3clpro enzyme there is evidence that serious sars-cov-2 infected cases have reported severe vitamin d deficiency and thus therapeutic concentrations of this molecule could potentially be used clinically in sars-cov-2 cases 51 52 the novel coronavirus termed ncovid-19 is now known as the third large-scale epidemic coronavirus introduced into the human population in the twenty-first century at the time of writing more than 367 million confirmed cases globally with nearly 250000 deaths had been reported by who clinically ncovid-19 is similar to sars regarding its presentation however the sheer capacity and speed of which ncovid-19 has spread to global pandemic levels have left researchers asking what makes this outbreak so similar in presentation yet so different in its virulence to previous coronaviruses genome sequence analysis has looked to investigate similarities in the phylogeny of sars-cov-2 which like sars and mers have now placed it in the betacoronavirus genus 53 the known severe and often fatal pathogenicity of betacoronaviruses has been highlighted in these previous epidemics and has reported higher transmission and pathogenicity than the milder and lesser known a-covs which are often compared to the common cold 54 our study further compares the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 using clustal omega alignment to show that of 918 sars nucleotides there was a similarity of approximately 95 furthermore we report high amino acid sequence identity in both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 main protease 3clpro which regulates coronavirus replication complexes 55 such highly conserved regions in both catalytic sites and the substrate binding regions of the enzymes has also been validated previously in studies by huang et al and muramatsu et al 44 45 while this region provides an attractive target for anti-viral drug design it also can begin to elucidate on viral origins and uncover its ease in transmission based on more recent virus genome sequencing results and evolutionary analysis the origins and transmission of ncovid-19 have uncovered bats as the natural host of the virus origins 42 as such studies earlier this year queried the unknown intermediate host between bats and humans and recent studies have pointed this to pangolins 41 42 to determine the extent of the evolutionary relationship between bat-cov pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 we corroborate that based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence bat-sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are grouped together and share  96 similarity with pangolin-sars-cov as the closest evolutionary ancestor 41 42 furthermore we report that in isolates of human wuhan sars-cov-2 there is an 8598 similarity in identity to pangolin-sars-cov which suggests that pangolin may be associated with the evolution of subsequent outbreaks of covid-19 regarding ncovid-19 and its similarity in transmission to sars-cov recent studies have also demonstrated that transmission occurs via the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 42 this may indicate why sars-cov-2 has often led to severe and in many cases fatal respiratory tract infections like its two sar-cov predecessors since the sars-cov epidemic of 2002 was also known to use the ace2 receptor to infect humans 56 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from ncovid-19 patients have shown that ace2 is widely distributed in the lower respiratory tracts of humans 42 furthermore the virion s-glycoproteins expressed on the surface of coronaviruses adhere to ace2 receptors on human cells 57 this location provides a target for uncovering the mechanistic insights into the severity of the disease and how this region has assisted in the zoonosis of sars-cov-2 specifically additionally mutations in the genomic structure of sars-cov-2 also might elucidate on the aggressiveness and pathogenicity of the viruses which may in turn help to explain why some strains are evolutionarily much more virulent and contagious angeletti et al have described mutations in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 and nsp3 proteins the former possibly accounting for the high virulence and contagion while the latter suggesting a mechanism that differentiates ncovid-19 from sars-cov 58 our studies build on this knowledge and assist to begin to identify the sub-clinical causes for the virulence and unique pandemic pattern of this outbreak by identifying the evolving mutations from region to region additionally previous studies by pachetti et al have reported novel recurrent mutations of the sars-cov-2 and our study corroborates these mutations in south america and africa regions 43 drug discovery and vaccine development against sars-cov-2 infection require time and lengthy processes however drug repurposing represents an alternative strategy in the current scenario some of these antivirals are currently being used clinically in sars-cov-2 treatment including lopinavir 59 ritonavir 60 remdesivir 61 and oseltamivir 62 however in the clinical setting lopinavirritonavir a 3clpro and rdrp inhibitors showed no benefit in covid-19 adult patients 48 the double point mutation in rdrp gene identified in our study can potentially lead to a drug-resistance event moreover other classes of drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown antiviral properties by blocking viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors 63 we observed no differences in the sars-cov-2 main proteinase 3clpro genome sequences but important differences in sars-cov-2 3clpro with sars-cov protein underlining the extreme need for identification of inhibitors to target the viral life cycle it is not known whether these mutations induce any alterations in the gene transcription or localisation of affected proteins which can be investigated in near future using biochemical and immunological approaches 64 65 various theories have been proposed regarding the origin of highly virulent sars-cov-2 particle our analysis shows that bat-sars-cov shares  90 similarity with the sars-cov-2 however it is possible that the bat coronavirus infected another intermediate host such as pangolin which subsequently transmitted the virus to humans pangolin isolates do share sequence identity with sars-cov-2 genomes and could be an intermediate host we identified novel mutation hotspot regions from south american and african isolates of sars-cov-2 genome sequences interestingly double point mutations in rdrp at position 14805 and 14808 and triple point mutations in nucleocapsid protein at position 28881 28882 and 28883 were identified in both south american and african genomic sequences suggesting the vulnerability of these genetic loci to undergo change in addition a novel mutation pattern specifically oriented towards nucleocapsid phosphoprotein in both south american and african sequences was noted while novel orf3a and rdrp specific variants were observed particularly from african genomic sequences the potential effects of double and triple point mutations on translated proteins and the virulence of sars-cov-2 requires further investigations sars-cov-2 main proteinase 3clpro genome was observed to be conserved across all collected genomic sequences despite significant similarities in the sars-cov 3clpro structure with sars-cov protein sars-cov-2 3clpro revealed certain key differences which highlight the extreme need for identification of novel mechanism-based drugs to target the virus processing repurposed drugs including natural flavonoids and bioflavonoids antimalarial antiviral and vitamins-based compounds have previously been shown to be beneficial in several viral infections and outbreaks the novel data generated from this study enhances our knowledge of the fine molecular differences that differentiate sars-cov-2 virus sars-cov it also highlights the emerging variations in the viral genome across different populations as the virus evolves to local genetic and environmental factors these findings will likely play a key role in the development of mechanism-based and targeted therapeutic strategies to treat sars-cov-2 infection and reduce its virulence  the structure and functions

et al 1999 zuniga et al 2004 in turn full-length negative-strand rnas serve as templates for the synthesis of genome rna and negative strand subgenomic rnas serve as the templates for subgenomic mrna synthesis in this discontinuous transcription model negative-strand subgenomic rnas are transcribed from a genome-length template and leader-body joining is accomplished during the synthesis of negative-strand subgenomic rnas through a copy-choice like mechanism involving trs-b and trs-l sequences pasternak et al 2003 sawicki and sawicki 1990 sawicki and sawicki 1998 van marle et al 1999 zuniga et al 2004 in an elaboration of this model viral andor cellular factors binding to cis-acting rna elements in the genomic rna 5 untranslated region 5utr and 3utr might circularize the genome promoting template switching by topologically enabling base pairing between trs-l and the nascent complementary trs-bs by the viral transcriptasereplicase complex trc sola et al 2005 zuniga et al 2004 recently mateos-gomez et al 2013 characterized a long-distance rnarna interactions within the genomic rna of tgev that serves as a transcriptional enhancer by bringing the trs-l and trs-b controlling n gene transcription into close proximity raising the possibility that other similar long range rnarna interactions might be present in other abundantly transcribed subgenomic rnas the 5-most 140 nts of the mhv genome have been predicted to contain three conserved stem-loops sl 1 2 and 4 based on a consensus secondary structural model from nine representative coronaviruses using phylogenetic analysis viennarna mfold and pknots kang et al 2006a liu et al 2007 the nine coronaviruses modeled include five beta-covs bcov human coronavirus hcov-oc43 hku1 sars-cov mhv-a59 three alpha-covs hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and tgev and one gamma-cov ibv the secondary structural models of the 5 140 nts of these coronaviruses are remarkably similar and all contain three conserved helical stems sl1 sl2 and sl4 sars-cov and bcov are also predicted to contain an additional stem-loop sl3 which folds the leader trs trs-l sequences into a hairpin loop for mhv a similar base pairing scheme for sl3 can be drawn chen and olsthoorn 2010 but the sl3 stem is not predicted to be stable at 37 c liu et al 2007 the secondary structures of the 5utr and adjacent coding sequences in all covs predicted by a structural-phylogenetic analysis chen and olsthoorn 2010 are largely consistent with the models by kang et al 2006a and liu et al 2007 in a recent study yang et al 2015 shape technology was utilized to determine the secondary structures formed by the 5 most 474 nts cis-acting region required for replication of mhv-a59 di rna the structure generated fig 1a was in excellent agreement with our previous characterization of sl1 li et al 2008 sl2 liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a and the correct structure for sl4 at position nts 80130 yang et al 2011 these stem-loops serve as cis-acting elements required for driving subgenomic rna synthesis interestingly the stem predicted for sl3 by phylogenetic algorithms chen and olsthoorn 2010 in the trs region was single-stranded with relatively high shape reactivity consistent with the prediction of liu et al 2007 that this region was weakly paired or unpaired the structure was also in good agreement with the two recent models of mhv-a59 rna secondary structure guan et al 2011 guan et al 2012 that identified two additional cis-acting replication elements required for optimal viral replication s5 fig 1 which contains a long-range rnarna interaction nts 141167 base paired with nts 363335 was equivalent to the base pairing nts 141170 paired with nts 363332 predicted by guan et al 2012 with the exception of nts 332334 which are unpaired in the guan model but are part of the sl5c stem in the shape-informed model fig 1a sl5a nts 171225 was identical to the stem-loop designated as sliv previously brown et al 2007 guan et al 2011 furthermore sl5a is remarkably similar to a stem-loop predicted and designated sl5 by chen and olsthoorn 2010 based upon a structural-phylogenetic analysis of the 5utrs of betacoronaviruses shape analysis has also provided biochemical support for sl5b sl5c sl6 and sl7 which in mhv previously lacked support from genetic or biochemical studies previously the brian lab defined four stem loops sli ii iii and iv within the 210 nts 5utr of bcov using the mfold algorithm and their existence is supported by enzymatic probing and mutational analysis in di rna replication assays chang et al 1994 raman et al 2003 raman and brian 2005 it should be noted that the four stem loops defined by the brian lab differ from the structures predicted by our group except that sliii in the brian model is almost identical with the predicted sl4b in mhv kang et al 2006a 
fig 1 shows a comparison of the secondary structure of mhv-a59 informed by shape analysis fig 1a with the most thermodynamically stable models of the 5 most 474 nts of bcov-mebus fig 1b sars-cov fig 1d and mers-cov fig 1c generated by rnastructure software without incorporating any shape reactivity data in general the overall configuration of the three models is similar despite the relatively high divergence of the nucleotide sequence a core feature is a conserved sl5abc four-helix junction a finding strongly consistent with a conserved core architecture laing and schlick 2009 the initiation codon for nsp1 is in a similar position in sl5a in the two lineage a beta-covs mhv and bcov whereas the initiation codon for sars-cov lineage b nsp1 and mers-cov lineage c are in more 3 positions in the first part of the 3 side of s5 for sars-cov and in sl5b for mers-cov as shown in fig 1 all four models contain the long-range base-pairing between 5utr sequences and the nsp1 coding region that make up the s5 stem the lengths of connecting single-stranded junctions between the helices are also generally similar or identical although the single stranded junctions between sl5a and the other two helices s5 and sl5b see fig 1 are shorter for bcov than they are in mhv or sars-cov the majority of the rnastructure-based model for bcov-mebus fig 1b is in good agreement with the model for the 5utr and n-terminal nsp1 coding region of bcov generated by mfold modeling phylogenetic covariation and biochemical and genetic studies brown et al 2007 chen and olsthoorn 2010 guan et al 2011 guan et al 2012 kang et al 2006a liu et al 2007 raman et al 2003 raman and brian 2005 although the nomenclature is not equivalent parts of the rnastructure-based model for sars-cov fig 1d are also similar to the model for the 5 proximal sequence of sars-cov developed through structural-phylogenetic analysis especially the presence of the substructures sl5a 5b and 5c which have been proposed to function in genome packaging chen and olsthoorn 2010 following the s5 helical stem the structures generated by rnastructure are more divergent among the four viruses with mhv-a59 and bcov-mebus being relatively similar although sl6 and sl7 are predicted to be in a forked stem-loop structure for bcov whereas for mhv they form separate stem loops and for sars-cov three stem-loops sl6 sl7 and sl8 are predicted in mers-cov this region is predicted to fold into two bulged stem-loop structures although their structure and position differs from that of mhv shape analysis for in vitro transcribed and refolded rna and ex virio genomic rna in the 5 cis-acting region generated identical secondary structures yang et al 2015 and was generally consistent with previous studies of rna secondary structure in this region this gives us confidence that this methodology will be useful to explore the fine and long range secondary structures in the context of genomic rna from authentic viral particles particularly to determine the interactions of the intergenic regions and their flanking sequences which are likely to play a role in regulating template switching in mhv sgrna synthesis the four betacoronavirus rnastructure-based models described above share the conserved sl1 sl2 sl4 and sl5abc secondary structure elements with the sequence covariation-based models of the cov 5utr chen and olsthoorn 2010 kang et al 2006a liu et al 2007 this conservation of sl1 sl2 sl4 and sl5abc among the betacoronaviruses and sl1 sl2 and sl4 among alpha beta and gamma coronaviruses suggests that these secondary structures serve as common cis-acting signals important in covs replication and viral rna synthesis functional analyses of individual structural elements described below suggest that the structural features of sl1 sl2 and sl4 are more important than the precise nucleotide sequences in these stem-loops however it should be noted that in bcov and sars-cov sl3 overlaps trs-l which defines the leader-body junction region for discontinuous sgrna synthesis while shape analysis indicates that the corresponding region is single-stranded in mhv consistent with the prediction of liu et al 2007 thus for this region primary sequence is the functionally important feature the mhv 5utr sl1 has been shown to be functionally and structurally bipartite by a detailed mutational and biophysical study li et al 2008 two pyrimidinepyrimidine non-canonical base pairs divide the sl1 helical stem into upper and lower parts the upper part of sl1 is required to be base-paired for efficient virus replication mutations that destroy base pairing of this region are lethal or generate viruses with impaired phenotypes compensatory mutations introduced in both sides of the stem that restored the base pairing produce viable viruses with phenotypes similar to wild type virus in contrast the viruses containing mutations that destroy base pairing in the lower region of sl1 are viable and the compensatory mutations predicted to restore base pairing are lethal suggesting that the sequences rather than base pairing in the lower portion of the sl1 stem are required genomes carrying lethal mutations in sl1 fail to direct the synthesis of minus-sense subgenomic rna implying that this element has a crucial role in this process possibly related to template switching events during leader-body joining li et al 2008 deletion of a bulged a35 in the lower portion of the stem increases the thermal stability of the helix recovered viruses all contained destabilizing second-site mutations near the a35 deletion suggesting that structural lability of the lower region of sl1 is important for virus replication the recovered viruses also contain additional mutations a29g or a78g in the 3utr providing genetic evidence supporting an interaction between the 5 and 3utrs as hypothesized in one model of coronavirus subgenomic mrna synthesis zuniga et al 2004 a dynamic sl1 model is proposed in which the base of sl1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5utr and the 3utr that stimulates subgenomic rna synthesis li et al 2008 sl2 is the most conserved secondary structure in the coronavirus 5utr with a 5 nt long stem capped with a cuuuguc pentaloop being the single most conserved sequence in the 5utr liu et al 2007 replacing u48 with c or a is lethal but the virus containing a u48g mutation is viable and grows with nearly a wt phenotype initial nmr studies of sl2 suggested that the imino proton of u48 in the wt sequence or g48 in a u48g mutant donates a hydrogen bond suggesting that it might stabilize a u-turn like conformation which is consistent with the genetic results liu et al 2007 however further nmr study showed that mhv sl2 takes on a structure incompatible with a canonical u48-u49-g50 u-turn loop structure but better fits with an uynmgua-like or ucuygua-like tetraloop structure with u51 flipped out and g50 stacked on a52 liu et al 2009a furthermore the structure of the sars-cov sl2 has been determined at atomic resolution showing that the sl2 pentaloop is stacked on 5-bp stem and adopts a canonical cuyg tetraloop fold with u51 flipped out of the stack lee et al 2011 making it likely that mhv sl2 has a similar structure further mutational studies of the loop demonstrate that any nucleotide replacement at c47 u49 and u51 can function and produce viable mutant viruses whereas the g at position 50 is required liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a mutational analysis of the sl2 stem demonstrates that the stem is required for viral viability whereas its nucleotide sequences are not important rt-pcr analyses of the genomes containing lethal mutations in sl2 indicate that sl2 is required for subgenomic rna synthesis liu et al 2007 the trs regions of some coronaviruses sars-cov and bcov for example are predicted to fold the leader trs sequences into a hairpin loop designated sl3 for the related betacoronavirus mhv a similar base pairing scheme for sl3 can be drawn chen and olsthoorn 2010 but the sl3 stem is not predicted to be stable at 37 c liu et al 2007 structural probing of mhv suggests that the trs region is single stranded yang et al 2015 the leader trs has a key role in subgenomic mrna synthesis the discovery and cloning of di rnas enabled a series of experiments using in vitro transcribed di rnas containing a reporter gene under the control of either mutant and wild type trs sequences to probe the sequence requirements for leader-body joining during subgenomic rna synthesis hiscox et al 1995 makino et al 1991 van der most et al 1994 these experiments demonstrated that there is a requirement for a minimum degree of sequence similarity between the trs-l and trs-b for transcription to proceed however the relationship between the level of sequence similarity between trs-l and trs-b and the transcriptional activity at a trs was not entirely straight-forward and thus additional factors are thought to play a role in two elegant mutational studies employing a tgev reverse genetic system this question was re-investigated in the context of infectious virus sola et al 2005 zuniga et al 2004 extending the region of potential base pairing between trs-l and the complement of trs-b to include 4 nts of trs 5 and 3 flanking sequence allowed sola et al to predict the ability of each trs sequence to promote transcription based on the gibbs free energy of the base pairing of this region sola et al 2005 previously the brian lab showed a bcov stem-loop they designated as sliii mapping at nts 97 through 116 in the bcov 5utr which must be base-paired for bcov di rna replication raman et al 2003 later chen and olsthoorn chen and olsthoorn 2010 employed a phylogenetic approach to predict the existence of sl4 downstream of the trs-l nts 80 through 130 in mhv which differs primarily from sl4 in the model predicted by leibowitzgiedroc group in that the proximal 6 nts at left side nts 7479 and right side nts 139134 of sl4 are base paired kang et al 2006a liu et al 2007 for mhv sl4 was predicted by the leibowitzgiedroc group kang et al 2006a liu et al 2007 to be positioned just 3 to the leader trs and is the first proposed structural rna element of the 5utr 3 of the leader fig 1a it is predicted to contain a bipartite stem-loop sl4a and sl4b separated by a bulge kang et al 2006a liu et al 2007 sl4b in this model corresponds to sliii in bcov 5utr raman et al 2003 mutations that disrupt the helix in the sliii in bcov 5utr raman et al 2003 led to loss of rna accumulation of mutant di rna whereas compensatory mutations that restore the structure result in some level of rna accumulation of double mutant di rna progeny the brian group also tested the functional role in viral replication of a short aug-initiated intra-5utr orf this is represented by the heavy line in fig 1 that is present in bcov potentially encoding an eight-amino-acid peptide which is phylogenetically conserved especially among betacoronaviruses they reported that the amino acid sequences of the intra-5utr orf are important for bcov di rna accumulation and there is a positive correlation between the maintenance of the short orf and maximal di rna accumulation raman et al 2003 the mhv 5utr also contains an eight-amino-acid small orf in sl4b identical to that present in the corresponding region of bcov raman et al 2003 yang et al 2011 performed an extensive mutational analysis of mhv sl4 and as part of that study demonstrated that the eight amino acid small orf did not have a critical role in mhv replication this is contrary to the finding in bcov di rna replication assays that these elements are necessary to continually passage bcov di rna raman et al 2003 raman and brian 2005 but is consistent with a later study by the brian group which demonstrated that there is positive selection for the small upstream orf but it is not essential for mhv replication in cell culture wu et al 2014 the likely explanation for the conflicting results from di assays and assays done with similar mutants in the context of a complete viral genome is that by their very nature di replication assays are competition assays with helper wild type virus and recombinant wt di rnas that arise during the experiment thus the di experiments may have detected subtle decreases in relative fitness in the bcov di rna replication that are not detected in straight forward viral replication assays that focus on recovering viable viruses the mutational study of sl4 by yang et al 2011 also indicates that for sl4b neither the structure nor the sequence have a critical role in viral replication the parallel analysis of sl4a was consistent with the chen phylogenetic based model of sl4 chen and olsthoorn 2010 leaving nts 7479 and 131139 unpaired however deletion of the entire mhv 5utr sl4 is lethal and the genome carrying this deletion is defective in directing subgenomic rna synthesis a viable mutant in which sl4 was replaced with a sequence unrelated stem-loop supports the hypothesis that sl4 functions in part as a spacer element and this spacer function plays an important role in directing subgenomic rna synthesis during virus replication yang et al 2011 the brian group determined that a stem loop that they designated sliv corresponding to sl5a in fig 1 spanning nts 171225 and thus extending into the nsp1 coding sequence was required for optimal replication of mhv guan et al 2011 nucleotides 238262 and nts 284309 make up a segment of the bulged stem-loop designated sl5b in a shape-generated model fig 1 and correspond to an identical stem-loop structure that was predicted as the basal segment of slv nts 238262 and nts 284309 for betacoronavirus by mfold and by covariation analysis brown et al 2007 and as part of an unnamed stem-loop by a structural-phylogenetic analysis of betacoronavirus chen and olsthoorn 2010 the shape-generated model differs from earlier models in that nts 234237 are base-paired with nts 314310 in the base of sl5b but these nucleotides are not included in slv brown et al 2007 or the corresponding region in chen model chen and olsthoorn 2010 moreover the structure predicted by shape analysis for nts 263283 in the terminal part of sl5b agrees with that predicted by the chen model chen and olsthoorn 2010 but is different from the stem-loop predicted for the terminal portion of bcov slv by brown et al 2007 bcov slv nts 239310 is also supported by rnase structure probing brown et al 2007 sl5c nts 315334 is similar to the distal part of slvi predicted by brown et al 2007 and to the corresponding region in the chen model chen and olsthoorn 2010 bcov slvi has been identified as a cis-acting element required for di rna replication brown et al 2007 in a recent study yang et al 2015 disruption of sl5c by four nucleotide substitutions while maintaining the wt amino acid sequence resulted in viable recombinant viruses with only moderate impairment of virus replication compared to that of the wt virus suggesting that the cis-acting sl5c is not required for viral replication this contrasts to the data obtained with a bcov di rna model replicon where the destruction of the distal helix that corresponds to sl5c resulted in a failure of di rna replication brown et al 2007 we have previously found similar discordant results with mhv di rnas and recombinant viruses containing identical mutations in their 3utrs johnson et al 2005 and subsequently with recombinant mhvs containing sl4b mutations yang et al 2011 when compared with a bcov di rna containing similar mutations raman et al 2003 currently we reason that the nature of di replication assays in which a mutant di rna must compete with helper wild type virus and recombinant wt di rnas that arise during the experiment allow di replication experiments to magnify modest decreases in fitness observed in straight forward viral replication assays that focus on recovering viable viruses making them much more severe or lethal in di rna replication assays sl6 spans nts 376446 in mhv-a59 and encodes nsp1 amino acid positions 5679 the shape-generated sl6 nts 376446 fig 1 is remarkably similar to slviii predicted by mfold for betacoronavirus brown et al 2007 but no structural or functional evidence supported the slviii prediction a mutational study yang et al 2015 demonstrates that mhv sl6 is not essential for viral replication in a previous study by brockway and denison 2005 a genome designated vusb5 containing nsp1 charge-to-alanine mutations in the base of the sl6 helix nts 399401 cgg  gca r64a and at nts 414416 gaa  gca e69a was not viable these mutations are predicted to destabilize the distal stem of sl6 a second mutation vusb6 includes substitutions at nts 441446 cgugau  gcagca r78a d79a was also not viable because the rna secondary structure in these putative cis-acting regions was not known at the time brockway and denison 2005 could not unequivocally assign the functional effects of these mutations on replication to the amino acid alterations in nsp1 modeling the effects of these mutations on the secondary structure of sl6 indicates that vusb5 would destabilize the distal portion of sl6 and vusb6 is predicted to completely open up the bottom of sl6 in light of the viability of the mutations that destabilize the distal region of sl6 sl6-b yang et al 2015 and the ability of brockway and denison 2005 to recover viable viruses containing mutations vusb4 in nsp1 that are predicted to destabilize the base of sl6 very much as did the lethal vusb5 it is very likely that the lethality of vusb5 and vusb6 are due to their effects on nsp1 rather than due to effects on rna secondary structure sl6 and sl7 in mhv-a59 diverge somewhat from the corresponding structures in bcov-mebus and are quite different from sl6-8 in sars-cov and sl6 and sl7 in mers-cov fig 1 this is consistent with functional studies of sl6 which demonstrate that sl6 is not essential for mhv replication yang et al 2015 in contrast to structural elements that are entirely within the 5utr sl1 sl2 sl4 or to the trifurcated sl5 stem-loop which extends from the 5utr into the nsp1 coding sequence which are lethal or result in viruses that are crippled for viral replication guan et al 2011 guan et al 2012 li et al 2008 liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a yang et al 2011 the coronavirus 3utr consists of 300500 nts plus a polya tail depending upon the particular coronavirus examined initial replication assays with mhv di rnas indicated that the minimal length of 3 sequence required for mhv di rna replication was 436 nts including part of the n gene and the entire 3utr 301 nts lin and lai 1993 luytjes et al 1996 the minimal sequences that support tgev and ibv di rna replication are 492 nts and 338 nts respectively neither region includes any part of the n gene dalton et al 2001 mendez et al 1996 and the presence of an accessory gene 3 of the n gene in the alphacoronaviruses suggested that at least for these coronavirus genera the 3utr contains all of the signals needed for replication subsequent experiments in which the mhv n gene was separated from the 3utr in recombinant mhvs suggested that the 3utr contained all of the cis-acting sequences needed for replication in betacoronaviruses as well de haan et al 2002 in a di replication assay the minimal cis-acting signal essential for negative-strand rna synthesis was only the 3 most 55 nts of the genome plus the polya tail lin et al 1994 the polya tail has been identified as an important cis-acting signal required for bcov di rna replication although as little as five as sufficed to initiate replication spagnolo and hogue 2000 the polya tail has also been shown to be necessary for mhv minus-strand rna synthesis lin et al 1994 a series of studies utilizing rna folding algorithms biochemical studies and functional studies have been used to investigate the structure and function of various cis-acting elements present in the 3utr goebel et al 2004a goebel et al 2007 hsue et al 2000 hsue and masters 1997 liu et al 2001 liu et al 2013 stammler et al 2011 williams et al 1999 zust et al 2008 and the current best model of the 3utr is shown in fig 2
zust et al 2008 the 5-most secondary structure is a 68 nts bulged stem-loop just downstream of the n gene stop codon and it is essential for mhv di rna and viral replication hsue et al 2000 hsue and masters 1997 this bulged stem-loop is predicted to be conserved among the betacoronaviruses and the pairing but not the primary sequence of the four covariant base pairs is critical for the function of the secondary structure goebel et al 2004b hsue and masters 1997 3 to the 68 nts bulged stem-loop is a hairpin stem-loop which can form a 54 nts hairpin-type pseudoknot which is required for bcov di rna replication williams et al 1999 the pseudoknot is phylogenetically conserved among coronaviruses both in location and in shape but only partially in nucleotide sequence indicating that it may function as a regulatory control element computer assisted inspection of the mers-cov sequence indicated it is present in this newly recognized betacoronavirus as well although in this virus the pseudoknot may contain a non-canonical base pair fig 2 goebel et al 2004a demonstrated that in mhv and bcov the bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot are in part mutually exclusive structures because they partially overlap and cannot be formed simultaneously see fig 2 the authors proposed that the bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot are the components of a molecular switch which has the potential to regulate a transition occurring during viral rna synthesis and supported this hypothesis by a series of reverse genetic experiments goebel et al 2004a computer assisted modeling and biochemical probing of the rna secondary structure of the last 166 nts of mhv downstream of the pseudoknot predicted a long multi-branch stem loop in this region of the genome liu et al 2001 di replication assays suggested that several of the stems in this region were functionally important paul masters group subsequently employed a reverse genetic approach and showed that for mhv the long hypervariable bulged stem-loop structure between nts 46156 is not essential for viral replication even though it contains an octanucleotide sequence 5-ggaagagc-3 which is highly conserved in the 3utr of coronaviruses goebel et al 2007 based on a reverse genetic study combined with a phylogenetic comparison of the 3utrs of a number of coronaviruses zust et al 2008 developed an improved model for the 3utr which is shown in fig 2 this model contains a triple helix junction in which stems designated s3 and s4 flank the hairpin stem-loop s2-l2 in fig 2 which participates in the pseudoknot stammler et al 2011 performed a series of biophysical studies demonstrating that the pseudoknotted conformation is much less stable than the double-hairpin conformation but suggest that stacking of the pseudoknot with the s3 helix can stabilize the pseudoknotted conformation allowing it to form consistent with the biophysical studies a reverse genetic study of this three helix junction region suggested that s3 is essential for viral replication liu et al 2013 however mutations disrupting the s4 helix of the triple helix junction or deleting most of the l3 loop are tolerated for the alphacoronaviruses although the pseudoknot is conserved the bulged stem loop bsl in fig 2 that is 5 to the pseudoknot is absent dye and siddell 2005 in the gammacoronaviruses a stem-loop located at the upstream end of the 3utr is required for viral replication dalton et al 2001 although a nearby pseudoknot is present in gammacoronavirus its functional importance has not been established williams et al 1999 only in the betacoronaviruses are both the pseudoknot and the bulged stem-loop closely overlapped although the primary sequences diverge among the betacoronaviruses the secondary structures are highly conserved and functionally equivalent goebel et al 2004b hsue and masters 1997 wu et al 2003 mhv and bcov 3utrs are interchangeable although the nucleotide sequences diverge by 31 hsue and masters 1997 and the sars-cov 3utr can replace its mhv counterpart without affecting viral viability goebel et al 2004b kang et al 2006b however the viable chimeras could not be recovered when the mhv 3utr was replaced with either the tgev 3utr or the ibv 3utr goebel et al 2004b hsue and masters 1997 kang et al 2006b in the negative-strand discontinuous rna synthesis model proposed by zuniga et al 2004 viral andor cellular factors binding to cis-acting rna elements in the genomic rna 5utr trs-l and 3utr might circularize the genome through rnarna or rnaprotein and proteinprotein interactions and thus produce a topology enabling base pairing between trs-l and the nascent complementary trs-bs during synthesis of minus strand rna a fair number of host proteins have been reported to interact with these cis-acting signals and these are reviewed below it should be noted that majority of this work has been performed with mhv and although it is likely that functionally important host proteins and the elements that they recognize are likely to be conserved it is possible that there might be some differences among the four coronavirus genera two viral proteins have been shown to bind to the coronavirus 5utr the n protein and nsp1 table 1
 the mhv n protein binds with high affinity and specificity to the trs-l and possesses helix unwinding properties that suggest a role in template switching baric et al 1988 grossoehme et al 2009 keane et al 2012 nelson et al 2000 consistent with the demonstration that the tgev and sars n proteins have rna chaperone activity zuniga et al 2007 it has also been suggested that n protein binding to trs-l favors translation of viral rnas tahara et al 1998 the n binding site in the leader rna sequence in mhv is specifically localized to nts 5672 uaaaucuaaucuaaacu and this interaction plays an important role in the discontinuous rna transcription unique to nidoviruses baric et al 1988 grossoehme et al 2009 keane et al 2012 nelson et al 2000 stohlman et al 1988 n protein contains two structurally independent rna-binding domains an n-terminal rna binding domain ntd and a c-terminal dimerization domain ctd hurst et al 2010 linked by a serarg sr-rich linker the n-terminal domain ntd of the cov n protein functions as an rna chaperone in vitro zuniga et al 2007 binds to the trs and the ntdtrs interaction is critical for efficient sgrna synthesis in mhv grossoehme et al 2009 keane et al 2012 the mhv ntd forms a high affinity k

 m1 11 complex with a trs-containing rna 5-gaaucuaaac and its complement ctrs grossoehme et al 2009 a recent study showed that the ntdtrs interaction involves n residues r125 y127 and y190 and anchors the adenosine-rich region in the 3 end of the trs rna to the -platform of n and that this interaction is critical for efficient sgrna synthesis keane et al 2012 this same study also showed that the ibv and sars-cov n protein ntd shows limited binding specificity for their cognate trs sequences keane et al 2012 thus it is not clear that the specific binding of n protein to the trs over and above its general rna binding activity plays a role in sgrna synthesis for all coronaviruses the second viral protein that has been shown to bind to the 5utr is nsp1 gustin et al 2009 the bcov nsp1 protein has been determined to bind to three cis-acting stem loops in the 5utr including sliii which corresponds to sl4b in our model and to regulate viral rna translation and replication gustin et al 2009 it is likely that the closely related mhv nsp1 protein has a similar function a number of host proteins have been shown to bind to the 5utr as well table 1 the pyrimidine tract-binding protein ptb has been reported to bind to the pentanucleotide repeat ucuaa in the positive-strand mhv rna leader trs and a role in subgenomic mrna synthesis was suggested based on a correlation between binding efficiency to different di rna constructs and the expression of a reporter under the control of a body trs choi et al 2002 li et al 1999 for tgev ptb was also identified as binding to the genomic 5utr using an rna affinity-mass spectroscopy approach galan et al 2009 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 hnrnp a1 binds to the complement of the 5 leader sequence negative-strand leader and to the complement of the trs-b sequences choi et al 2002 li et al 1997 li et al 1999 the functional importance of this binding has been controversial shen and masters 2001 tested the role of hnrnp a1 in mhv replication by investigating the ability of mhv to replicate in cells lacking a functional hnrnp a1 the infected cells supported viral replication and synthesized normal levels of genome and subgenomic rnas suggesting that hnrnp a1 is not required for mhv discontinuous transcription or genome replication however it has been shown that multiple other type hnrnps including hnrnp a2b1 hnrnp ab and hnrnp a3 bind to the negative strand complement of the mhv leader trs shi et al 2003 and that overexpression of hnrnp ab resulted in a 45 fold enhancement of viral rna synthesis suggesting that these proteins might also facilitate rna synthesis and be able to substitute for hnrnp a1 another member of the hnrnp family synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic rna-interacting protein syncrip similarly binds to the mhv 5utr and to its negative strand complement choi et al 2004 the l-trs sequence has been shown to be necessary but sufficient for syncrip binding and sirna knockdown of syncrip delayed the time of peak viral rna synthesis in mhv infected cells choi et al 2004 similarly to the 5utr multiple proteins have been demonstrated to bind to the 3utr a reverse genetic study by zust et al 2008 revealed that a 6 nt insertion between the 3utr pseudoknot and the s3 helix see fig 2 crippled mhv replication but they identified second site mutations in nsp8 and nsp9 which restored viral replication to near normal levels based on this genetic result they suggested a model in which a complex of the nsp8 primase plus the associated proteins nsps 7 9 and 10 binds to the double hairpin conformation of the 3utr just adjacent to s3 to initiate minus strand rna synthesis the nascent newly synthesized minus strand rna would displace the 3 half of the s3 helix and permit the formation of the rna pseudoknot also allowing binding of the main replicase complex containing nsp12 the main coronavirus rdrp nsp13 helicase plus the associated rna modification enzymes nsp 1416 bhardwaj et al 2004 decroly et al 2008 ivanov and ziebuhr 2004 minskaia et al 2006 snijder et al 2003 a number of host proteins have been reported to interact with the 3utr yu and leibowitz reported four host proteins binding to the mhv 3-most 42 nts rna probes using rnase protectiongel mobility shift and uv cross-linking assays and a conserved 11 nts ugaaugaaguu sequence spanning position 2636 in the 3utr note that in this numbering system position 1 is the first nt upstream of the polya tail was necessary for protein binding activity and for efficient di rna replication yu and leibowitz 1995a yu and leibowitz 1995b a second protein binding region was similarly mapped within a 38 nucleotide nt sequence 166129 nucleotides upstream of the 3 end of the mhv genome and was also found to be necessary for efficient di rna replication liu et al 1997 subsequent studies determined that the proteins binding to the mhv 3-most 42 nts element include mitochondrial aconitase and the chaperones mitochondrial hsp70 hsp60 and hsp40 nanda et al 2004 nanda and leibowitz 2001 ptb has been shown to bind to a negative-strand rna complementary to the mhv 3utr at position 53149 and less strongly at positions 270307 huang and lai 1999 deletions in the 53149 binding site that abolished ptb binding also strongly inhibited subgenomic mrna synthesis in an mhv di construct containing a reporter gene under the control of a trs sequence huang and lai 1999 in addition to binding to the 5utr hnrnp a1 has two binding sites in the mhv 3utr and these binding sites are complementary to the ptb binding sites in the negative sense 3utr enumerated above huang and lai 2001 di rnas containing a mutated hnrnp a1-binding site had reduced rna transcription and replication activities using an rna affinitymass spectroscopy approach galan et al 2009 identified nine host proteins including several hnrnps a1 a0 a2b1 q and u the glutamyl-prolyl-trna synthetase eprs arginyl-trna synthetase polya binding protein pabp and the p100 transcriptional co-activator that bound to the tgev 3utr a possible role for these proteins in tgev replication was suggested by the sirna-mediated knockdown of pabp hnrnp q and eprs expression with a concomitant 23-fold decrease in tgev rna synthesis and viral titer in infected cells spagnolo and hogue 2000 demonstrated an interaction of pabp with the polya tail is required for bcov and mhv di rna replication and a tail length of 5 is sufficient to support di replication the widely accepted model of coronavirus discontinuous transcription of subgenomic rna postulates that leader body joining occurs during the synthesis of minus strand rnas baric and yount 2000 sawicki and sawicki 1990 sethna et al 1989 zuniga et al 2004 have provided strong support for this model by showing that in tgev the body trs sequences upstream of each gene signal template switching to the trs 5 leader trs-l and proposed a refinement of the model in which the 3 and 5utrs interact through rnarna andor rnaprotein plus proteinprotein interactions to promote circulization of the coronavirus genome to place the elongating minus strand in a favorable topology for leader-body joining several candidate rnaprotein interactions have been identified and proposed to contribute to circulization of the genome spagnolo and hogue 2000 suggested that the interaction of pabp bound to the coronavirus 3 polya tail might result in the circularization of the coronavirus genome through its ability to interact with eif-4g a component of the three-subunit eif-4f cap binding protein that binds to mrna cap structures during translation sonenberg 1996 sonenberg et al 1978 an interaction between ptb bound to leader and body trs has also been postulated to play a role in coronavirus transcription by mediating an interaction between the trs and the 3utr by binding to hnrnp a 1 bound to its protein binding sites in the 3utr lai 1997 lai 1998 although this is an attractive model the fact that a deletion encompassing the high affinity hnrnp a1 binding site in the 3utr is able to replicate and direct normal synthesis of subgenomic mrnas makes the ptb-hnrnp a1 association less likely to have a crucial role in leader-body rejoining goebel et al 2007 although the possibility that other members of the hnrnp family could substitute for hnrnp a1 remains a possibility see section 5 for a discussion of this li et al 2008 reported that viruses recovered after deletion of a bulged a35 in the lower portion of the 5utr sl1 stem contain additional second site mutations a29g or a78g in the 3utr providing genetic evidence in support of an interaction between the 5 and 3utrs they proposed a dynamic sl1 model in which the base of sl1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5utr and the 3utr that stimulates subgenomic rna synthesis in unpublished work p liu and leibowitz identified a potential base pairing between nucleotides 824 in the mhv 5utr sl1 and two discontinuous sequences in the 3utr nts 16 and 218228 note that the 3utr sequences are numbered with position 1 corresponding to the first nucleotide 5 of the poly a tail an extensive mutational analysis of these sequences failed to provide genetic support for a functional role for this potential 53utr interaction in mhv replication thus the precise mechanism by which the 5 and 3utrs associate during viral replication remains to be functionally defined a series of studies utilizing consensus covariation modeling chemical probing nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and shape analysis have identified and characterized individual or small numbers of rna secondary structures in the cis-acting region containing the mhv 5utr and extending into the n-terminal nsp1 coding sequence trs 3utr and polya tail and many of the studies have examined their functional roles in viral replication chen and olsthoorn 2010 guan et al 2011 guan et al 2012 kang et al 2006a li et al 2008 liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a yang et al 2011 a detailed understanding of the rna structures within the cis-acting sequences in the 5utr and 3utr and eventually the entire mhv genome and of the rnarnas rnaproteins interactions that direct viral rna synthesis and virus replication will assist our understanding of these processes understanding these interactions in highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov may enable the design of small molecule inhibitors of these replicative processes  genome-wide identification and characterization of point mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome jun-sub kim jun-hyeong jang jeong-min kim yoon-seok chung cheon-kwon yoo myung-guk han   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in late december 2019 since then it has rapidly spread across the world and was finally declared as a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization on january 30th 2020 1 sars-cov-2 is taxonomically classified under nidovirales order coronaviridae family coronavirinae subfamily and betacornoavirus genus it is an enveloped virus with non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded rna although sars-cov-2 presents with a lower pathogenicity than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which emerged in 20022003 and middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which emerged in 2012 it reveals more rapidly human-to-human transmission 2 the genome of sars-cov-2 consists of non-segmented rna that includes a 5 untranslated region utr structural proteins non-structural proteins several accessory proteins open reading frames and a 3 utr the orf1ab of several orfs is proteolytically cleaved into 16 putative non-structural proteins nsp116 for genome maintenance and replicase complex formation in viral replication the structural proteins essential in viral particles include the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s protein is crucial for binding directly to the human receptor ace2 inducing viral entry and determining host tropism and transmission capacity 35 the s protein is cleaved into 2 subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit directly recognizes and attaches to human receptor ace2 while s2 fuses the host cell membrane with viral membranes allowing entry of sars-cov-2 6 in general rna viruses like sars-cov-2 undergo rapid mutation enabling evolutionary and genetic diversity which result in alterations such as viral transmissibility receptor affinity host tropism and pathogenicity in recent years several studies based on mutation analysis of sars-cov-2 genome have attempted to understand phylogenetic relationships host infectivity human-to-human transmission viral tropism and pathogenicity of sars-cov in humans firstly the comparative evolutionary diversity in point mutations synonymous-non-synonymous mutations are suggestive that sars-cov-2 should to be classified into 3 major clades s g and v and other clades according to amino acid changes 79 secondly the high affinity and stable structure of rbdace2 have been associated with amino acid variations in the rbd such as the high affinity group n354d d364y v367f and w436r 10 and the high ace2-binding affinity and stability group 484-ngvegfn-490 q496n and q496y 11 thirdly the deletion of 382 nucleotides towards the 3 end of the viral genome may have an impact on viral phenotype 12 and the qtqtn motif adjacent to the polybasic cleavage site rrar chain of amino acids at the bridge between s1 and s2 may be related to host adaptation 13 in addition insertion of the rrar which has been well known to determine high or low pathogenicity in avian influenza virus may be important in determining transmissibility and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 14 finally primer-template mismatch has been known to affect the stability and functionality of polymerase in particular the primer-template mismatch located in the primer 3 end region can interfere with polymerase active sites and this may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the molecular diagnosis using primers or probes 15 therefore we analyzed the mutations of the sars-cov-2 genome by focusing on phylogenetic evolution rbd region deletion mutations in polybasic cleavage site and primer-template mismatches in the genome although the mechanisms responsible for rapid transmission pathogenicity and tropism in sars-cov-2 remain unclear identification of mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome may help to interpret the high infectivity of the virus with the host the set of 4254 sars-cov-2 genome sequences and acknowledgment files were

bootstrap 1000 replications for the phylogeny test kimura 2-parameter as a substitution model and pairwise deletion as gapmissing data treatment for identifying the types of point mutation synonymous and non-synonymous mutation from 4254 sequences we separately extracted 12 fully coding sequences cdss determining the sequence of amino acids in a protein from the genomes and then conducted an in-house program based on perl computer programming language to analyze mutations among the cdss and the reference genome in nomenclature for the replacement from one amino acid to a different amino acid in a gene we illustrated it as the gene name surrounded by parenthesis after the substitution of amino acids for example d614g s means that an aspartic acid is converted into a glycine at amino acid position 614 of the s gene in comparison with the reference strain hcov-19wuhan-hu-12019 for the comparative analysis of primer- and probe-template mismatches we referred several lists published

phylogenetic analysis was carried out with 178 representative strains to comprehend monophyletic distribution of the sars-cov-2 population the phylogenetic tree showed 3 major clades s g and v clades similar to previous reports by gisaid these clades s g and v clades were determined by the mutations l84s orf8 g251v orf3a and d614g s respectively figure 1 of the three mutations determining the clades the significant d614g s in g clade is located in the adjacent polybasic cleavage site but its actual function on rdbace2 affinity is unclear in addition to the three clades two subclades belonging g clade were observed and they were named g1 and g2 clades referring to their parent clade name the g1 and g2 subclades were determined by three mutations g204r n r203k n and p214l orf1b and one mutation q57h orf3a respectively figure 2 in this respect the derivation of g1 and g2 subclades from the g clade shows that a clade can be also determined by one or more mutations to identify the number and the types of mutation across a total of sars-cov-2 strains the 12 different types of cds from the 4254 strains were completely extracted in accordance with the genomic positions presented by the ncbis genbank format file sequence id nc0455122 the unsuitable sequences with base calling errors unsolved nucleotides as n and undefinable gaps were excluded a total of 47176 cdss were gathered from orf1a orf1b s m e n orf3 orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 we identified 767 types of synonymous and 1352 types of non-synonymous mutation from them genes with high frequency mutations were orf1a orf1b s n and orf3a orf1a showed the highest frequency mutations containing 302 types of synonymous and 530 types of non-synonymous mutation table 2 figure 3 the non-synonymous mutations with high frequency in the genes were representative mutations in the clades l84s orf8 in s clade d614g s in g clade g251v orf3a in v clade p214l orf1b r203k n and g204r n in g1 clade and q57h orf3a in g2 clade figures 4 and 5 orf1a and orf1b encode replicase polyproteins essential component of the viral rna replication therefore conserved structure of them have been the focus of antiviral drugs 18 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp located between orf1a and orf1b is an important component for application and translation and has a functionally conserved region known as high sequence similarity 19 the conserved region of rdrp has been widely used as a target for designing primers and probes based on rt-pcr technology in genetic diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in this regard the mutations from orf1a and orf1b were analyzed and we identified 302 types of synonymous and 530 types of non-synonymous mutation in orf1a and 179 types of synonymous and 305 types of non-synonymous mutation in orf1b also a total of 144 types of mutation were identified in the rdrp region corresponding to the 13442 to 16236 genomic position of which 56 types of synonymous and 88 types of non-synonymous mutation were detected figure 6 since the non-synonymous mutation with the highest frequency of in the rdrp region was p214l which determines the g1 subclade together with g204r and r203k of the n gene it was necessary to further study the functional interaction amongst these mutations of the orf1a and n gene on one hand 9 types of primer-template mismatch were identified in the rdrp region although it is not understood how these mismatches affect the stability of primer-template complexes it is necessary to determine the interrelationships the s gene of sars-cov-2 plays an important role in escaping the immune system of host the rbd in the s gene is directly or indirectly concerned with the binding and affinity to ace2 the strong binding between rbd and ace2 may have led to the worldwide transmission and rapid infectivity of sars-cov-2 on the other hand the rrar which is located between s1 and s2 681685 amino acid position of the s gene may be related to the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 therefore it is might be inferred from the mutations in the rbd and the polybasic cleavage site in the s gene that the mutations will provide important clues to understanding immunity and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 we identified 109 types of synonymous and 182 types of non-synonymous mutation in the s gene figure 7 d614g is a major non-synonymous mutation in g clade and accounts for 1764 130 in a total of 13537 non-synonymous mutations above all it is located in the s1s2 junction region near the polybasic cleavage site but its biochemical and structural relationships with ace2 has been unclear so far in the rbd region 2247823191 genomic position we found 12 types of synonymous and 27 types of non-synonymous mutation among them the d467v i468f i468t i472v g476s s477g v483a p491r y508h r509k and v510l were located within the zone 443510 amino acid position of the s gene adjacent to ace2 in particular the v483a and g476s mutations have previously been reported to be related to human receptor-binding affinity in mers and sars-cov research 20 21 we detected a r682q mutation from the rrar where arginine residue was replaced by glutamine residue the arginine residue is not only electrically charged but also strongly basic while the glutamine residue is polar uncharged therefore it is necessary to study how this biochemical difference may affect functional and structural changes of the proteins of s1 or s2 according to a recent study the fact that a deletion of the qtqtn amino acid motif near the polybasic cleavage site is related to adaptation of sars-cov-2 has been reported hence we tried to confirm whether some deletions occurred in this region 675679 amino acid position of the s gene we identified no deletion of qtqtn in this region but confirmed 5 types of non-synonymous mutation type 1 with n679y and s680p type 2 with n679k type 3 with q677h type 4 with q675h and type 5 with q675r except for type 1 type 2 to 5 had a common feature where glutamine and asparagine with a polar uncharged side chain were converted into lysine histidine or arginine with basic property although deletion of the qtqtn motif was not identified near the polybasic cleavage site it may be informative to study the functional significance of the five mutations in this region the e m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 are less frequent mutations than other genes orf3a is a novel short positive protein essential to viral adaptation in vitro and is involved in the viral pathogenicity the major types of synonymous mutation of orf3a are q57h and g251v which are significant mutations in determining g2 clade and v clade respectively it is inferred from this result that q57h and g251v may have a positive effect on viral adaptation in the e gene known to be involved in viral budding along with the m gene we confirmed a relatively small number of mutations in it this means that there are high conserved regions so it seems reasonable to infer that the preserved sequence is important to encode protein participating in viral reproduction like the region of rdrp the e gene has been also used to design primers and probes for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 we identified 10 types of synonymous and 12 types of non-synonymous mutation in the e gene figure 8 of these mutations 7 primer-template mismatch mutations 3 types of synonymous and 4 types of non-synonymous mutation occurred the m gene which is associated with cellular immunogenicity showed 28 types of synonymous and 21 types of non-synonymous mutation of which mutations with high frequency were observed as t175m and d3g several types of synonymous mutation in orf6 orf7 and orf10 were identified but mutations with high frequency were not observed however l84s in orf8 was identified as a mutation with high frequency the n gene packaging of the viral rna genome into the medical ribonucleocapsid has been regarded as a candidate target region for primers and probes like the e and rdrp genes in the n gene we detected 63 types of synonymous and 119 types of non-synonymous mutation among them r203k and g204r showed high frequencies in g2 clade together with p214l orf1b in addition 51 primer-template mismatch mutations 17 types of synonymous and 34 types of non-synonymous mutation occurred from the non-synonymous mutation is overall more frequent than the synonymous mutations in the set of 4254 sars-cov-2 genome sequences it is inferred from this results that the evolution of the sars-cov-2 has been accepted to be positive selection in consequence several point mutations may directly or indirectly influence the interaction between sars-cov-2 and human and the diversity of mutations in sars-cov-2 may enhance the evolution of the virus towards rapid transmission based on our analysis the d614g s mutation of g clade which revealed the highest frequent in our phylogenetic analysis may have a positive advantage in natural selection according to the frequency of mutations within sars-cov-2 strains orf1a orf1b s and n genes were shown at high frequency and they may advantageously evolve to adapt to not only external interactions with host cells such as recognizing a cell surface receptor attaching to the host receptor and fusing with cellular membranes but also internal interactions in host cells such as replicating and transcribing viral genome and budding by cellular exocytosis although d614g in the s gene is not a mutation within rbd the fact that it occurred as the highest frequency in all sars-cov-2 genomes suggests it may be related to host infection and transmission therefore we believe that it is necessary to continuously monitor the accumulation of mutations and to further study how these mutations affect receptor affinity propagation ability and pathogenicity on the other hand rdrp e and n genes are the target genes for designing primers and probes in rt-pcr-based sars-cov-2 diagnosis owing to their high sequence conservation it has not been known how the primer-template mismatches affect the accuracy and precision of the genetic diagnosis of covid-19 but we suggest that it is desirable to avoid the variable hotspot regions as much as possible our results about genomic mutations of sars-cov-2 strains may be helpful for interpreting the potential relationships of pathogenicity infectivity and transmission between sars-cov-2 and human host  overwhelming mutations or snps of sars-cov-2 a point of caution naveen vankadari   the pandemic corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is an urgent public health emergency and made a serious impact in global health and economy httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncov the sars-cov-2 pandemic is the most serious hit in the last 10 years and caused more than 170500 deaths globally and the morbidity of this viral infection reaching 3 million landmark wwwcoronavirusgov epidemiologists predict the several more spike in the coronavirus infection could rise in different countries with higher density in population verity 2020 online since the initial reports on this pneumonia-causing novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 in wuhan china huang 2020 mortality and morbidity are increasing exponentially around the globe despite several antiviral treatments with the drastic increasing number of the positive cases around the world the world health organization who raised the importance in the assessment of the risk of spread and understanding genetic modification that could have occurred in the sars-cov-2 wwwcoronavirusgov hence it is worthwhile to look for any mutations or snps in sars-cov-2 alone that could the cause for the constant change and virulence causing increase in continuing mortality and morbidity to this end we aimed to look for mutations and snps in the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 worldwide where the sequencing data was collected using the next generation sequencing and deposited in the ncbi and all other repository as of 24th march 2020 out of 172 countries with confirming positive cases only 12 countries have sequenced the complete genome of sars-cov-2 httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenbanksars-cov-2-seqs fig 1
 furthermore there are about 106 complete and validated sequence data sets available in the ncbi database httpswwwncbinlmnihgovlabsvirusvssi and httpsbigdbigaccnncov surprisingly we noticed several hundreds of point mutations or snps among the different isolates from all over the world with different sequence data sets fig 1a and b and fig s1a and s2 and 47 key point mutations or snps were located along the entire genome in the sequence just in 12 different countries single sequence comparison these mutations involved in the different protein-protein recognition fig 1c point mutations or snps have great implications for the target drug binding and receptor binding puty 2019 the overall mutations phylogeny shows the 3 groups httpswwwgisaidorg of mutations which are evolved in these 3 months predominantly the mutations were also found in the different vital proteins of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein nsp1 rdrp and others fig s1 and s2 and warrants epidemiologists and medical fraternity for the use of drug treatment options this also suggests that sars-cov-2 is highly venerable to have quick changes and mutate even during the person-to-person transmission this also helps to overcome the previous misconception of sars-cov-2 may not get mutated during person-to-person transmission andersen 2020 the rate and number of snps or mutations in sars-cov-2 within three months of outbreak underlines the complexity of virus to handle and corroborate the quick evolution of sars-cov-2 fig s3 we next looked at individual mutations that occurred in the three different prime proteins i outer membrane spike glycoprotein ii non-structural protein nsp1 and iii rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp vankadari and wilce 2020 wrapp 2020 narayanan 2008 miller 2020 fig 1b-d foremost in spike glycoprotein the mutations or snps occurred are surface exposed and in the solvent-accessible regions some involved in the host receptor ace3 and cd26 binding and furin cleavage site fig s1c and d vankadari and wilce 2020 wrapp 2020 coutard 2020 these mutations could make the virus more resistant to receptor binding inhibitors and some of the antibodies these warrants epidemiologists medical fraternity and pharmacologists to use the antivirals and antibodies which are compatible and promising to their strain of sars-cov-2 and not to be generalised in some cases furthermore we also noticed a number of mutations or snps in other key proteins nsp1 and rdrp fig 1b and s1a and s2 interestingly most mutations were also surface exposed and show the high possibility to impede the antiviral drugs although there was only 12 out of 172 countries complete genome sequence is available for now genome analysis data is adequate to prove the rapid rate of mutations and snps striking in sars-cov-2 the rate at which sars-cov-2 getting mutated and evolved was least noticed till date and it needs further attention and research for the cause for the rapid genetic alterations and how it can be regulated which is a serious concern the notable mutations in the viral vital proteins spike glycoprotein nsp1 and rdrp and at the host or drug integration region raise the speculation on the changes in the cell entry and response to the different antiviral treatments besides several snps were also noticed in the other regions such as orf-1ab codes for 17 structural proteins and orf-810 fig s1a furthermore nsp1 and orf8 are two the particular hot spot area where the mutations and deletions were noticed in the early onset of infection late january and the rate of mutations were quickly increased 35 then declined or stabilised in the later passages of the virus fig s1b it is also interesting to notice that orf8 in sars-cov-2 is not split into 8a and 8b as observed in sars-cov-1 chan 2020 lau 2015 however our understanding of the structure and functional importance of orf8 is limited which need further attention we also like to extend our discussion that the observed contact changes in the genome of sars-cov-2 is not only limited to mutation or snps but also there are several nucleotide deletions and insertions were also noticed across the genome these observations has great importance for assessing the increased virulence and efficacy of antivirals and raises possible cause for the overwhelming mutations in sars-cov-2 one such hypothesis could be the extensive use of a various combination of antiviral drugs that could have to lead the sequential mutations in the virus manrubia 2005 peck and lauring 2018 sanjuan 2010 this study also warrants the importance of sequencing the whole genome of sars-cov-2 after several passages and key mutations or snps should be noted for the effective drug designing and treatment options such as antiviral and immune therapy with the exponential sars-cov-2 public-health emergency it is essential to know the epidemiology and evolution of the virus to be prepared for the combat  biomedical science review

pathogenesis the comparative studies of other coronaviruses offer insights into the understanding of sars virus the identification of a novel coronavirus as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has given an impulse to research on the coronavirus family which has long been relegated to the status of a scientifically interesting but medically unimportant virus family it is not that coronavirus has never been important in fact coronavirus infections of farm animals such as pigs or chickens are so common and devastating that vaccinations against these viruses are routinely performed in humans coronavirus infections are responsible for almost 2000 of common colds in wintertime 38 57  and the virus has been repeatedly implicated but never confirmed as one of the causative agents of multiple sclerosis  13 71   nevertheless the lack of a firm association of coronaviruses with any serious human illnesses had dampened the publics interest in this virus family until the sudden emergence of the sars coronavirus 24 41 62  which caused the first new infectious disease of this millennium the numerous past studies of the coronavirus family then quickly provided a blueprint for understanding the sars virus however the contagiousness and high mortality rate of the sars virus are unparalleled to the other known human and animal coronaviruses thus sars coronavirus is unique in multiple ways the understanding of this virus including its origin molecular properties and pathogenesis will be crucial for the future management of this infectious disease since the studies on the sars virus are very limited so far this review aimed at investigating the possible properties of the virus based primarily on comparative studies of other coronaviruses coronaviruses are divided into three antigenically distinct groups which are also consistent with the genetic relatedness of these viruses 49  group i consists of human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e porcine transmissible gastroentefitis virus tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and enteritis virus fecov canine coronavirus ccov and others group ii consists of human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 mouse hepatitis virus mhv bovine coronavirus bcov and others group iii consists of avian species including chicken infectious bronchitis virus ib and turkey coronavirus tcov the newly discovered sars virus cross-reacts with antibodies of group i coronaviruses 41  however its genetic sequence indicates that it belongs to none of these three groups it is of about equal distance from both groups ii and iii in the coronavirus family phylogenetic tree in nucleic acid or protein sequence 41 55 66  a similar conclusion is reached irrespective of which viral rna region is used for comparison thus sars virus represents a new group of coronavirus although this virus most likely originated from a wild animal see next section the sars virus has been well adapted in humans as evidenced by the high person-to-person transmissibitity of the virus thus it is most appropriately named human coronavirus sars strain however its official taxonomic status remains to be decided since the first reported occurrence of sars in southern china speculation on the origin of sars virus has largely focused on the animal species in that region because the genetic sequence of sars virus is distinct and distant from that of any known coronaviruses in domestic animals the sars virus most likely originated from a wild animal the search for coronaviruses in wild animals eventually turned up a coronavirus in civet cats in a market in guangdong province the civet cat coronavirus is very closely related to the sars virus with more than 99 sequence homology 1 30a 60  recent reports indicate that sars virus is distinct from the civet cat virus by limited deletions and mutations the extent of the coronavirus infection among wild animals is not yet clear 30a  the animal handlers appear to be at risk for the infection as a higher proportion of them have antibodies against sars virus 30a however none of these data have so far been confirmed although plausible the civet cat virus as the origin of sars virus remains to be established it is possible that civet cats were infected with the virus from another animal species in either case the critical questions are whether there is extensive horizontal transmission between animals and whether the jump of the virus from animals to human was a rare and accidental event or portends frequent occurrences in the future the answers to these questions will determine whether these animals are viable reservoirs for future sars outbreaks thus epidemiological studies of coronavirus infections in wild animals are critical tbr control of future sars outbreaks although coronaviruses in general infect only the animal species of their natural origin they are known to jump to other species relatively easily the human coronavirus oc43 is very closely related in genetic sequence to bcov 16 36  thus there is no doubt that the virus jumped from one species to the other bcov has also been reported to infect humans occasionally causing diarrhea 31 82  when mhv was passaged in tissue culture cells the virus eventually adapted to growing in human cells 9 10  although the mechanism of such an adaptation is not known it is likely that it was the result of mutations in certain viral genes thus there is considerable latitude in species specificity of coronaviruses so far sars virus has been shown to infect humans and macaque monkeys 25  whether it can infect other animal species in natural infections and experimental inoculations may determine the extent of natural reservoirs for sars virus and the feasibility of establishing animal models for it complete sars virus genome sequences have been determined from more than twenty different isolates so far these sequences showed extremely high conservation indicating that they were all derived from a common source and did not diverge significantly during the first 55 66  sequence comparison with those of orfs of the other known coronaviruses reveals a similar pattern of gene organization namely gene la-lb replicase and protease genes spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n in the order of 5 to 3 ends 48  notably the sars virus genome does not encode a hemagglutinin-esterase he protein which is present in most of the group ii coronaviruses interspersed between these well-characterized genes are a series of orfs of unknown functions at a quick glance the sars virus rna has 20rfs between the s and e genes and an additional 3-50rfs between the m and n genes this gene organization most closely resembles that of group iii coronaviruses in the sars virus genome the organization of gene la-lb which accounts for more than two-thirds of the viral rna is very similar to that of the murine coronavirus mhv except that it contains only one papain-like protease plpro-2  fig 2  thus the plpro-2 of sars virus is likely responsible tbr the cleavage of all the nterminal proteins of gene l a which is normally carried out by plpro-1 in murine comnavirus 6  it is noted that group iii coronaviruses have only one plpro however the sars virus genome has remnants of the plpro-i sequence furthermore the sars virus has the equivalent of the leader peptide p28 which is missing in the group iii viruses the remaining sequences of gene la-lb are highly conserved among all of the coronaviruses 37 68  therefore orfs la and lb are likely translated into a polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism 12  all of the potential gene products in gene la-lb are relatively conserved between sars and other coronaviruses the 3c-like protease 3clpro is likely responsible for the cleavage of all the remaining proteins in gene 1 a-1 b 29  based on the predicted cleavage site specificity the sars virus gene la-lb is likely processed into thirteen final protein products the functions of these gene products are mostly unknown nevertheless they are likely involved in viral rna replication in mhv all the rnanegative temperature-sensitive mutants are mapped in the genetic regions covering almost the entire gene 1 8  69 it should be noted that some of the protein-processing intermediates in addition to the final products may also function in viral replication overall from the perspective of gene organization the 5-half of the sars virus genome appears to be more closely related to group ii viruses whereas the 3-half more closely resembles group iii virnses therefore sars virus may have been derived from recombination between a group ii and a group iii virus however the published sequence analysis indicated that the entire sars virus rna resembled that of group ii viruses no evidence of recombination was noted 55 66  since the genetic sequence of sars virus is approximately equidistant between group ii and iii viruses the possible presence of recombination might not have been evident from sequence analysis alone regardless recombination is probably not the triggering event for the jumping of the virus from animals to humans since the recombination most likely occurred between the ancestral coronaviruses coronavirus genes except for gene 1 are typically expressed from subgenomic mrnas which share a common leader sequence at the 5-end but initiate at different places from the consensus intergenic sequences or transcription regulatory sequences trs in the genome and extend toward the 3-end of the genome 48 the transcription initiation sequences are typically rich in u c and a residues and highly conserved in front of each gene each mrna except for the smallest is physically polycistronic but can be used to translate only the 5-most orf in rare situations several orfs are translated from a single mrna eg mrna 3 of ibv and mrna 5 of mhv by internal initiation or other mechanisms such as an internal ribosomal entry site which are not completely understood these unconventional translation mechanisms are not efficient as a result these gene products are usually not very abundant these orfs typically encode viral nonstructural proteins except for the e protein in some coronaviruses significantly the orfs between the structural protein genes are extremely heterogeneous among different coronaviruses in terms of the number of potential gene products and the method of their expression they are not essential for viral replication in cell culture however recent studies suggest that deletions of these nonessential orfs could result in the reduction of viral virulence  19 61   conceivably some of these orfs in sars virus could be responsible for the high virulence of this virus a report shows that five subgenomic mrnas were detected in vero cells infected with the sars virus 66  thus some of the orfs are expected to be expressed by internal initiation if they are translated at all however it is possible that additional subgenomic mrnas are transcribed the amounts of the various subgenomic mrnas vary tremendously among different coronaviruses depending on the strength of the transcription-start signals 48  the less abundant subgenomic mrnas frequently were missed in northern blot analysis indeed the analysis of the sars virus genome detected many more consensus intergenic sequences ucuaaac and related sequences which can potentially be used for transcription initiation 55 66  a recent study detected eight subgenomic mrna species in sars virus-infected cells 70  in general coronaviruses have four envelope proteins s m e and he the spike protein forms the characteristic spikes that are the namesake of the virus the s protein is often cleaved into s1 and 2 domains by intra-and extracellular proteases the cleavage often enhances the viral infectivity 28  however the s protein of some viruses such as feline is not cleaved and yet the virus is fully infectious  18  sequence analysis of the s protein of sars virus suggests that it will not be cleaved the spikes bind to the receptor on the target cells the receptor-bind-ing domain is typically localized in the n-terminus of the s1 domain 27 42  the spike consists of oligomeric structures which are formed by the heptad repeats in the 2 domain  fig 3  typically there are two heptad repeats in the coronavirus 2 proteins 2 also contains a fusion peptide sequence which is responsible for the fusion activity associated with coronaviruses significantly the optimum ph for the spike-induced fusion differs from virus to virus while most mhv strains cause fusion at the neutral ph 77  some variant viruses induce fusion at ph 65 26  since the ph requirement of membrane fusion dictates the mechanism of virus entry either by fusion at the plasma membrane or by endocytosis different coronaviruses may use different entry mechanisms sars virus also causes syncytia formation in vivo but not in the cultured vero cells 41  as the s protein of sars virus possesses most of the features of the s proteins of other coronaviruses it will be interesting to know the conditions such as protease sensitivity and ph dependence of membrane fusion that enhance the sars virus infectivity it should be noted that both s1 and 2 contain the neutralization epitopes of mhv 48 and that there is a hypervariable region in s 1 which is frequently mutated or deleted in the coronaviruses such mutations very often change the biological or pathogenic properties of the virus the m and e proteins are the minimum protein units for virus assembly 11 75  both are integral membrane proteins m protein resides not only on the viral envelope but in the viral internal core as well 65  in the cells m protein is anchored in the golgi complex thus dictating the site of virus assembly to the er-golgi complex 73  the expression of m and e proteins together is sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles vlp when s protein is coexpressed with m and e proteins the s protein is incorporated into vlp with presumably authentic conformation such a vlp can infect cells  11   thus these vips will be an excellent candidate as a potential vaccine intriguingly it has recently been shown that e protein may not be absolutely required for viral infectivity 43  sars virus has comparable structural proteins he protein is seen only in some group ii coronaviruses it is not required for viral infectivity even in those viruses eg mhv hcov-oc43 that contain the he protein however he protein may be involved in the infection of bcov as a monoclonal antibody against he protein can inhibit bcov infection 21  the he protein binds to certain sialic acid residues and possesses an acetyl-esterase activity it is conceivable that he protein provides the initial binding contact between the virus and the target cells however subsequent tight and specific binding may be mediated by the s protein he protein bears sequence homology with the hemagglutinin protein of influenza c virus thus prompting suggestions that recombination has taken place between an ancestral coronavirus and an influenza virus 54  sars virus does not encode the he protein the final structural protein is n protein which likely interacts with viral rna and makes up the viral core and nucleocapsid it is interesting to note that the coronavirus particles appear to include both an icosahedral core and an internal helical nucteocapsid 65  n protein is present in both structures sars virus has typical n protein structural motifs including several rna-binding domains coronaviruses have an envelope that reflects the lipid composition of the cellular membranes however remarkably coronavirus is one of the very few enveloped viruses that are able to cause enteric infections thus the viral envelope certainly can resist the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract namely the acidic environment of the stomach and the bile and lytic enzymes of the small intestines the structural and chemical basis for such unusual resistance is not yet clear correspondingly sars patients very often show gi symptoms and the virus is usually detected in the stool 62  therefore the envelope of sars virus likely consists of unusual structures indeed it has been shown that sars virus can survive in diarrheal stool for as long as 4 days and on a dry surface for 24 h world health organization bulletin these unusual envelope properties have implications for the control of the sars outbreaks as an rna virus sars virus can be expected to undergo mutation at a very high frequency with an estimated error frequency of 1 x 10 4 for rna-dependent rna polymerases in general the sars virus genome can be expected to accumulate an average of three mutations per round of rna replication thus sars virus like all other rna viruses probably consists of a collection of rna quasispecies 23  such a high frequency of mutation implies that the tkna viral genome is inherently limited in size coronaviruses are obvious aberrations yet despite having an extraordinarily long rna genome sars virus and other coronaviruses appear to be relatively genetically stable to date the predominant rna species from different sars patients appear to be quite homogeneous the various sars virus isolates from different geographical regions differ by no more than ten amino acids in the entire genome it is not clear whether these differences confer any differences in the biological properties of the virus nevertheless they allow epidemiological tracing of the virus transmission routes it appears that two different lineages of the sars virus can be independently traced 67  whether the virus will undergo a higher frequency of mutation in the future once seasonal changes occur or after specific drug treatments are introduced is an issue of concern however there has been no investigation of the nature of rna quasispecies of sars virus derived from different patients so far such rna quasispecies may represent potential sources of viral divergence coronaviruses have another powerful genetic means for evolution rna recombination which occurs at a very high frequency 46  in theory recombination may not only introduce genome alterations but paradoxically balance the deleterious effects of mutations by removing the undesirable defects 47  this ability may explain why coronavirus can maintain such a long rna genome the ability of coronaviruses to recombine may stem from the nonprocessive nature of coronavirus rna polymerase which mediates discontinuous rna synthesis during mrna transcription 49  in natural infections both mutation and recombination have been demonstrated to contribute to the evolution of the coronaviruses avian coronavirus ibv continues to undergo antigenic changes in the field through both mutation and recombination involving the s gene recombination could occur between the field isolates and the vaccine strains of ibv 44 76  this evolution causes problems in vaccination strategies as multiple vaccines directed against different viral serotypes must be used simultaneously another example is the emergence of porcine respiratory coronavirus prcov from the enteric tgev in europe as well as in the us in the 1980s 50  again this shift in viral tissue tropism and virulence was due to deletions and mutations in the s gene this evolution turned out to be beneficial to the livestock industry because the resultant prcov is considerably less virulent than the parental tgev and in fact was used as an attenuated virus vaccine for tgev a feline comnavirus has also been demonstrated to have undergone recombination with a canine coronavirus resulting in changes in the biological properties of the virus 35  the ability of the coronavirus to recombine has been utilized as a genetic tool for manipulating the coronavirus genome until recently it had been impossible to apply reverse genetic methods for studying coronaviruses because of the large size of its genome taking advantage of the ability of coronavirus to recombine with not only other coronaviruses but also viral rna fragments masters and his colleagues have developed techniques to introduce mutations into mhv defective interfering rna and allow it to recombine with a temperature-sensitive mutant the mutation being in the n protein-coding region of mhv 63  by selecting wild-type viruses capable of growing at the high temperature and using other selection markers it is now possible to engineer mutations into certain viral rna regions or exchange certain viral genes between different coronaviruses 32  this technique has been applied only to mhv so far however a flood of reports in the last 2 years has shown that full-length infectious cdna clones can be obtained for several coronaviruses including tgev mhv hcov-229e pedv and ibv 2 14 72 81  these cdna clones have added to the arsenal of coronavirus genetic tools it is anticipated that the full-length sars virus cdna will be available soon both this cdna and the targeted recombination approach may provide the reverse genetic tools for studying sars virus the temptation to manipulate the sars virus genome will be great however i must add a word of caution before such attempts are made the scientific community must be vigilant in guarding against the misuse of these genetic tools to alter the sars virus genome or create chimeric coronaviruses involving sars virus genes i propose a moratorium on these types of experiments until the various concerned international communities agree upon specific guidelines the potential for unleashing a more virulent new sars virus is simply too onerous to be ignored coronaviruses in general cause disease by both cytocidal and immune-mediated mechanisms most coronavirus infections in cell culture result in lysis or apoptosis of the infected cells 53  furthermore the virus causes cell fusion resulting in the formation of cell syncytia these cytopathic effects cpe are usually the results of viral replication for example the coronavirus mobilizes cellular vesicles to form the viral replication complex 30  which may disrupt the golgi complex 51  sars virus also causes cpe in vero cells furthermore it causes syncytia formation in the lung tissue suggesting that it causes cytocidal effects another eerie similarity between sars virus and other coronaviruses is their ability to induce fibrosis eg certain strains of mhv cause fibrosis in the liver 22  and sars virus causes fibrosis in the lung 58  the n protein of mhv has been shown to stimulate the promoter activity of the prothrombinase gene 59  which correlates with the fibrin deposit in the liver associated with mhv infection a similar mechanism may be involved in the fibrosis of the lung induced by sars virus immune responses also contribute to the pathogenesis of several coronaviruses most notably cytotoxic t cells and cytokines play a very significant role in the neuropathology caused by mhv 56  on the other hand humoral antibodies are important for the disease associated with fipv in which certain antibodies against the viral s protein induce severe peritonitis symptoms 17 78  in the case of sars there is an occurrence of cytokine storms and accumulation of inflammatory cells particularly macrophages in the lung during the peak of the disease 58  suggesting that both innate and adaptive immune responses are important for the disease thus the clinical management of sars should consider not only antiviral but anti-inflammatory strategies as well several viral genes are likely involved in viral pathogenesis most importantly the spike protein gene affects viral pathogenesis not only by determining the host target cell specificity but by other mechanisms as well as exemplified above the emergence of the weakly virulent prcv from the virulent enteric tgev was the result of mutations in the s gene 7  also it has been shown that a single mutation in the s gene of mhv can significantly alter the tissue tropism and virulence of the virus 52  the so-called non-essential orfs may also play a role in viral pathogenesis these genes are not necessary for viral replication in tissue culture cells as experimental or natural deletions of any one of these genes did not affect the ability of the virus to replicate however some of these deletion mutants show much lower virulence than the wild-type virus in infections in animals  19  tt is significant that sars virus shows significant divergence of these orfs from other coronaviruses a preliminary report shows that the civet cat coronavirus has a 29nucleotide deletion which caused two non-essential orfs to fuse into one creating a new orf in the sars virus 30a it will be very interesting to find out if this new orf contributes to the virulence of the sars virus other viral gene products may also alter cellular responses to the viral infection for example m protein of tgev can induce interferon 15  and e protein of mhv can induce apoptosis 3  they may modulate the course of viral infection another important issue in the pathogenesis of sars virus is whether the virus can cause chronic persistent infection this issue concerns the possible presence of chronic carriers who may serve as the source of continuing sars outbreaks although human coronaviruses typically cause short self-limiting illnesses most of the animal coronaviruses are known to cause persistent infection the best studied coronavirus in this regard is feline coronavirus fecov infected animals can continue to shed virus tbr as long as 7 months after infection even though these animals do not show symptoms 34  tgev also shows a similar tendency in which the virus can be detected in the respiratory tract of the infected animals several months after infection 40 74  mhv can persist in the central nervous system many months after intracraniat inoculation 40  thus the ability to persist is a common feature of most coronaviruses under some conditions sars virus may also have this property so far viral rna reportedly has been detected in patients stool more than 30 days after infection world health organization bulletin coronavirus primarily infects the epithelial cells of the gi and respiratory tracts but the virus can replicate in many cell types particularly macrophages sars virus also infects a wide spectrum of cell types it has been detected in the blood lung liver and kidney and in various bodily secretions including stool and urine 41  thus sars virus may induce systemic infection the primary determinant of target cell specificity of the virus is the nature of its cellular receptors type i coronaviruses use aminopeptidase n cd 13 of various animal species as receptors in a species-specific manner 20 80  while a type ii coronavirus mhv uses the carcinoembryonic antigen as recenor 79  the receptors for type iii viruses and sars virus are not yet known it should be noted that the virus easily adapts to cell lines of different animal species probably by using other related molecules as a receptor 9  thus the specificity of the spike-receptor interaction may not be very rigid interruption of the binding between the spike protein and the receptor will be a potential means of inhibiting viral infection the next step of virus infection is virus entry the mode of virus entry for coronavirus may vary between different viruses although most viruses appear to enter cells by fusion at the plasma membranes some viruses may enter cells by acidic ph-dependent endocytosis regardless the fusion activity is likely important for virus entry several functional domains including the heptad repeat which is important for oligomerization of the spike protein the putative fusion peptide and the receptor-binding domain of the s protein will be good targets for antivirals macromolecular synthesis including transcription translation and protein processing offers many potential molecular targets as well most notably proteases rnadependent rna polymerases rdrp and helicases are good targets unfortunately in vitro rdrp assays are still neither efficient nor specific precluding their use as a molecular tool for drug screening in vitro protease assays for both 3clpro and plpro in contrast are well established 33 83  the protease activity is essential for viral protein processing and rna replication inhibition of the protease function shuts off viral rna synthesis instantaneously 69  thus the proteases are potentially powerful targets for antivirals furthermore the x-ray crystallographic structure for the 3clpro is available 4  as is a computation model for the sars virus 3clpro 5  these in addition the processes of virus assembly which likely occurs in the er-golgi intermediate compartment 39  and virus exit which occurs through the cellular secretory pathway are also potential antiviral targets it has been known that the e and m proteins are the minimum components for virus assembly forming vlp in the absence of other viral proteins 11 75  the cellular machinery involved in the formation of virus particles is still not clear it is a potential antiviral target as well the prospect for sars vaccines is uncertain several potential approaches are feasible the killed whole virus vaccine is attractive because of the availability of a robust cell culture system that yields a large quantity of virus particles attenuated virus vaccines are still unattainable because the parameters for virus attenuation are not yet well defined ultimately the attenuation of viral virulence needs to be verified preclinically in animal models recombinant subunit vaccines consisting of the spike protein alone or in combination with other viral proteins can be prepared by using the recombinant proteins themselves or delivered by virus vectors or as dna plasmids these approaches are technically feasible however the timetable for the development of any of these vaccines is lengthy and the potential success of vaccine development may be hindered by the lack of accessibility to animal models and a suitable population base for clinical trials at the present time the macaque monkey is an acceptable animal model however with the sars epidemic virtually over worldwide it will be difficult to test the efficacy of these vaccines eventually ring vaccination vaccination of the at-risk populations around the exposed people may have to be attempted nevertheless vaccine development is clearly a top priority as vaccines are the main weapons in the arsenal against future outbreaks whether they are natural or man-made ie bioterrorism in origin a survey of the currently available animal coronavirus vaccines offers a glimpse of the potential efficacy of sars vaccines live attenuated vaccines have been used effectively against ibv sometimes a killed virus vaccine is used as a booster to the primary attenuated virus vaccine 45  the drawbacks of these vaccines are that ibv exists in multiple antigenic types and that the virus undergoes tequent antigenic changes as a result of mutations and recombination therefore multiple viruses of different serotypes must be used in combination vaccines to protect against most ibv serotypes for tgev live attenuated virus vaccines have been used to vaccinate the adult pigs the vulnerable piglets receive the protective antibodies through milk improvement in lactogenic immunity is therefore the aim of tgev vaccine development killed canine coronavirus has proven to be efficacious as a vaccine experimentally 64  although it is not routinely used because of the lack of necessity on the other hand feline coronavirus vaccines have been proven to be not only inefficacious worse yet the have been shown to lead to even more severe viral infections in the vaccinated cats 78  enhancement of viral infections by vaccines is probably due to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement ade in which antibodies against certain epitopes of the spike protein complex with the virus particles and enhance their infectivity 171 it is difficult to predict how the candidate sars virus vaccines will behave if immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sars then an effective sars vaccine may turn out to be as elusive as the fipv vaccines similar difficulties have plagued the developments of other viral vaccines such as dengue virus hiv hepatitis c virus sars is the first newly emerged infectious disease in this century it is not likely to be the last one even though the sars outbreak is now under control after a devastating run of more than 6 months that affected and threatened many countries worldwide the virus will continue to pose a threat in the near future because of possible human and animal reservoirs for the virus sars may return in the coming months or years in the short term the isolation and quarantine of patients and exposed individuals remain the only effective means of containing an outbreak valuable experience in disease control was gained from this first outbreak thus the future outbreaks of sars and other emerging and re-emerging respiratory infectious diseases will likely be limited to sporadic occurrences hopefully intensive studies of the sars virus in the near future will provide sufficient understanding of its molecular biology and mechanism of pathogenesis to enable the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines only then can we effectively control the disease   the evolution of codon usage in structural and non-structural viral genes the case of avian coronavirus and its natural host gallus gallus paulo brando eduardo   codon usage cu refers to the frequency of the occurrence of each codon for at least two-fold degenerate codons hershberg and petrov 2008 ie it is an indication of the preference of a genome for one or more codons if more than one codon is possible for the same amino acid natural selection for efficient protein synthesis speed and folding and genetic drift based on mutation pressure that leads to a homogeneous genome and the 3rd codons gcs are the most evident forces under codon usage evolution that could lead to detectable codon usage bias cub yang and nielsen 2008 which has been increasingly used in studies on virus and host molecular evolution

  gc3 graphs fig 2 because for all four viral genes observed gc3 points fell outside the curve indicating that codon usage for all the strains under analysis was not the sole result of the random accumulation of mutations nonetheless the nc
  gc3 plots show that a coronavirus codon usage could also be a consequence of mutation pressure as the points were in the vicinity of the curve meaning that the gc at the synonymous 3rd codon position follows the viral genomic gc to some degree it must be considered that both genetic drift derived from the mutation pressure and natural selection detected for a coronavirus could also harbor some relationship with genomic rna secondary structure constraints and not only codon usage as synonymous 3rd base mutations though synonymous in terms of amino acid codification could result in altered rna secondary structure cardinale et al 2013 and consequently impaired viral transcription replication and assembly as signals for rna replication and genome packaging in coronaviruses are rna secondary structure-dependent narayanan and makino 2007 williams et al 1999 such structures must be under intense evolutionary constraints that balance with codon usage evolution from the host side mutation bias has also been shown to be the major driving force of g gallus codon usage evolution with minor participation of natural selection rao et al 2011 in agreement with the results presented herein suggesting a common evolutionary path for both virus and host a marked difference was noticed regarding the degree of codon usage bias for each a coronavirus gene studied for s n and plpro all mean values were just above 40 indicating a moderate bias gu et al 2004 but for nsp2 the mean nc 5301 indicated a lower codon usage bias these results provide evidence that a coronavirus genes have taken different codon evolution pathways depending on the function that each protein possesses the function of nsp2 is still not clearly defined but a role has been suggested as a co-factor for rna synthesis graham et al 2005 possibly in the early stages of virus replication despite the limited number of studies on nsp2 evolution it can be speculated that a less biased codon usage for a protein involved in early stages of viral replication would allow for a less restricted trna preference and thus a more efficient start to the viral cycle the finding that the most biased gene was s mean nc
  43 might be linked to its relationship with the g gallus immune system the spike protein is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and thus theoretically the more s protein that is expressed the higher the generation of a humoral immune response against s and the lower cell infection by a coronavirus considering this stronger codon bias of s the fact that s showed the lowest cai value when compared to the other three genes and the fact that genes with lower cais are expressed less efficiently roth et al 2012 a deoptimization of s expression could have been selected for with the advantage of lower s expression providing further evidence that viral proteins that participate in host recognition might have a codon usage less similar to that presented by the host bahir et al 2009 regarding cai values for n nsp2 and plpro fig 3 suggests that the distributions were mostly above those for s with the highest values for n 075079 n protein plays a chief role in nucleocapsid assembly that is dependent on the association of positively charged amino acids with the genomic rna of coronaviruses masters 2006 and is thus under strong purifying selection as shown herein by the fishers exact test on dsdn values optimization of the codon usage in a manner closer to that of the host would endow a coronavirus with a more efficient and accurate synthesis of the nucleocapsid protein the distribution of cais for nsp2 and plpro stayed between those for n and s fig 3 considering that plpro is a protease acting on the n-terminus domains of replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab ziebuhr et al 2000 an intermediate adaptation to the hosts translational environment could have evolved as a balance between the conservation of structure of the enzymatic domain and the plasticity to follow amino acid mutations occurring on the plpro cleavage sites of diverse a coronavirus types as compensatory mutations showing that epistasis could also be detected at the codon usage evolution level it is noteworthy that none of the a coronavirus strains showed no possible combinations of simultaneous occurrence maximumminimum cai or nc data not shown for any of the four genes meaning that cai and nc might be driven to different evolutionary pathways and that strains with a high cai ie highly adapted to the hosts transcription environment are not necessarily the ones with the lower bias ie with higher nc the distribution of 100 conserved amino acid positions coded by the preferred codon is noteworthy when one compares the s gene with n nsp2 or plpro as a single position was found in a region outside antigenic and hypervariable regions cavanagh et al 1988 kant et al 1992 in the s gene while for the other three genes these positions n
  20 28 and 71 respectively were scattered throughout the regions considered with statistically significant differences when compared to s p
  00001 or  217378 this low number of conserved amino acid positions coded by the preferred codon in s could be an additional molecular evolutionary mechanism for s antigenic diversity as fine-tuning translation kinetics could result in high deoptimization of codon usage and a consequent increased fitness aragons et al 2010 on the other hand possibly due to strong structural and functional constraints n nsp2 and plpro have a higher number of amino acid positions coded by the preferred codon which is the same codon preferred by the host table 1 which would allow higher fitness to the host transcription environment zhou et al 2012 in a concerted virushost molecular evolution thus taking conserved amino acid positions coded by the preferred codons as a selection unit it follows from the above mentioned differences that natural selection could either be positive for these positions leading a protein under purifying selection eg n nsp2 and plpro to show the same codons as the host for that amino acid or negative if a protein is under positive selection as shown for s the most probable reason for the fact that non-100 conserved amino acid positions coded by a preferred codon for that amino acid noted as nc in table 1 were only found in a coronavirus genes and not in the g gallus genes is that host genes are less susceptible to both the occurrence of putative amino acids and codon usage polymorphisms contrary to what is observed and expected for virus genes 
nc might be considered to be an accurate indicator of codon usage bias because the frequency of amino acids is normalized during the analysis and does not add bias however similarly to the cai the outcome of the nc analysis is a single number leading to a loss of deep evolutionary information similar to the loss of evolutionary information in nucleotide or amino acid distance-based phylogenetic analyses taking into account informative sites during codon evolution studies for instance 100 conserved amino acid positions coded by the preferred codon for that amino acid could unveil data that would otherwise be lost in the analysis and that could be used to gain a more comprehensive understanding of molecular evolution in association with the codon usage bias indicators and selection analysis it would be interesting to use the analyses presented herein not only for a better understanding of virus evolution but also as supporting predictors of spill-over events such as influenza wahlgren 2011 and the new human coronavirus kindler et al 2013 now named mers-cov for which the role of codon usage evolution in virus adaptation to new hosts has been widely ignored in conclusion a coronavirus codon usage evolves independently for each gene in a manner predictable by the protein function proteins with high functional and structural constraints are more adapted to g gallus its natural host with a balance between natural selection and mutation pressure giving further molecular basis for the virus ability to exploit the hosts environment  structural and functional conservation of cis-acting rna elements in coronavirus 5-terminal genome regions ramakanth madhugiri nadja karl daniel petersen kevin lamkiewicz markus fricke ulrike wend robina scheuer manja marz john ziebuhr   
cis-acting rna elements play important roles in the life cycle of plus-strand  rna viruses including rna replication viral gene expression and genome packaging barton et al 2001 liu et al 2009b firth and brierley 2012 goto et al 2013 kuo and masters 2013 morales et al 2013 nicholson and white 2014 keane et al 2015 compared to many other rna viruses information on cis-acting rna elements of coronaviruses including their specific functions structures and interactions remains limited particularly this applies to viruses from genera outside the genus betacoronavirus for reviews see brian and baric 2005 masters 2007 liu and leibowitz 2010 madhugiri et al 2014 yang and leibowitz 2015 madhugiri et al 2016 historically rna structures and sequences required for betacoronavirus rna synthesis were characterized using defective interfering di rna-based systems chang et al 1994 chang et al 1996 raman et al 2003 raman and brian 2005 brown et al 2007 gustin et al 2009 thus for example rna structure probing studies of mouse hepatitis virus mhv and bovine coronavirus bcov-derived rnas led to the identification of up to four stem-loops within the 5-terminal 215 nt of the genome for recent reviews see liu and leibowitz 2010 madhugiri et al 2014 madhugiri et al 2016 yang and leibowitz 2015 in many cases potential functional roles of rna structural elements present in the 5-terminal genome region could be confirmed by mutational analyses more recently genus- and subfamily-wide rna structure-based alignments using all currently approved coronavirus species in the respective genera of the coronavirinae were performed for this highly divergent genome region the studies led to a model of three highly conserved stem-loop structures called sl1 sl2 and sl4 in the 5-terminal 150-nt genome region kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 chen and olsthoorn 2010 madhugiri et al 2014 furthermore nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy provided structural support for sl1 and sl2 in three betacoronaviruses mhv bcov and hcov-oc43 liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a li et al 2008 also a selective 2-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension shape analysis in virio and ex virio confirmed the predicted sl1 sl2 and sl4 structures for mhv-a59 yang et al 2015 possible biological functions of betacoronavirus 5-terminal sl1 and sl2 structures in viral replication could be substantiated by reverse genetics studies kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a li et al 2008 for example an mhv study revealed that destabilization of the upper part of sl1 produces viruses with replication defects while compensatory mutations restoring these base-pairing interactions led to viruses with near-wildtype growth kinetics li et al 2008 in contrast disruption of the basal part of sl1 was largely tolerated while compensatory mutations that restored these base-pairing interactions proved to be lethal suggesting a critical role for the rna sequence rather than structure in this lower part of sl1 based on these and other data sl1 was suggested to require an optimal stability suitable to establish transient long-range rna- andor protein-mediated interactions between the 5- and 3-utrs that may be required for genome replication and subgenomic sg mrna synthesis other reverse genetics studies confirmed that the 5-terminal sl2 is also required for mhv rna synthesis liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a based on phylogenetic analyses the sl2 was proposed to be the most conserved rna secondary structure in coronaviruses kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 chen and olsthoorn 2010 it is composed of a 5-bp stem and a conserved loop sequence 5-cuugy-3 that was shown to adopt a 5-ucuygua-3- or a 5-uynmgua-3-like tetraloop structure liu et al 2009a to extend these studies and corroborate predictions on alphacoronavirus-associated 5-terminal rna structural elements we used a combination of bioinformatics biochemical and reverse genetics approaches focusing on structures and functions of the 5-terminal sl1 and sl2 structures in the hcov-229e genome genus alphacoronavirus the data obtained in this study provide evidence for the existence of two sl structures sl1 and sl2 in the 80-nt 5-terminal hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 genome regions the structures were found to be required for viral replication and appear to be largely conserved between alpha- and betacoronaviruses thus for example we were able to show that the hcov-229e sl2 structure can be replaced with that of the betacoronaviruses bcov and sars-cov respectively providing experimental support for our previous hypothesis that some rna structural elements in coronavirus untranslated genome regions may be more conserved than previously thought even across genus boundaries madhugiri et al 2014 wildtype hcov-229e and hcov-229e mutants were propagated in huh-7 cells hcov-229e titers were determined by plaque assay using huh-7 cells recombinant vaccinia viruses were propagated in cv-1 and bhk-21 cells

mutagenesis of the hcov-229e cdna insert in vhcov-inf-1 was done using previously described methods thiel et al 2001 to construct vhcov-inf-1 derivatives containing nucleotide substitutions in the hcov-229e 5-utr we used the plasmid pbs-5gpt for recombination with vaccinia virus vhcov-inf-1 this pbluescriptii-derived plasmid was constructed to contain the e coli gpt gene flanked by i a 500-bp fragment representing the vaccinia dna sequence located upstream of the hcov-229e cdna insert in vhcov-inf-1 and ii a 500-bp fragment representing the cdna sequence of nts 10011500 of the hcov-229e genome rna next a gpt-positive vhcov-inf-1 derivative called vrec-5gpt was selected from cv-1 cells infected with vhcov-inf-1 and transfected with pbs-5 plasmid dna in a second selection step d980r cells were infected with vrec-5gpt and transfected with an appropriate pbs-5utr-mut plasmid dna using appropriate selection conditions hertzig et al 2004 gpt-negative vhcov-inf-1 derivatives called vhcov5utr-mut that contained the desired mutations in the 5 utr cdna sequence were isolated the pbs-5utr-mut plasmid constructs used to produce the recombinant vhcov5utr-mut vaccinia viruses contained the 500-bp vaccinia virus sequence described above followed by a cdna copy of hcov-229e nts 11500 with appropriate mutations being introduced by pcr-based mutagenesis sequences of vhcov5utr-mut vaccinia virus constructs were verified by southern blotting and sequence analysis as described thiel et al 2001 the vhcov-inf-1 derivatives generated in this study were called vhcov5utr-c11g

secondary structures were visualized using varna version 393 darty et al 2009 the color codes used in
figs 1 2 5b and 8 indicate base-pairing probabilities derived from dot plots generated by rnafold see suppl figures 1 and 2 structure-based alignments were calculated with locarna version 1811 will et al 2012 consensus secondary structures were calculated with rnaalifold --nolp --color -r -p version 241 lorenz et al 2011 herein the color code represents the numbers of different base-pairing types and numbers of incompatible bases respectively sequence conversation was visualized using weblogo 350 fig 5c crooks et al 2004 to provide experimental support for our rna structure model of alphacoronavirus 5-terminal genome regions madhugiri et al 2014 suppl figure 1 we performed a series of rna structure probing experiments rna transcripts representing the 5-terminal 100 nt of the hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 genome respectively were produced in vitro and treated with the methylating agent dms ehresmann et al 1987 n1 methylation of unpaired adenosines and n3 methylation of unpaired cytidines was identified by primer extension analysis using reverse transcriptase 5-32p-labeled products obtained in these reactions were separated in denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by phosphorimaging see materials and methods rna that was not treated with dms was included as a control to detect potential nonspecific termination products of the reverse transcriptase reaction autoradiograms that are representative of an extensive set of dms structure probing experiments and a summary of the structure probing information obtained in these experiments are shown in fig 1 our rna secondary structure predictions madhugiri et al 2014 suppl figure 1 and the in vitro dms structure probing data obtained in this study fig 1 lead us to propose a model in which the 5-terminal 80-nt regions of the hcov-229e and nl63 genome rnas fold into two conserved stem-loops sl called sl1 and sl2 while the adjacent 3 region containing the leader-associated transcription regulatory sequence trs-l zuniga et al 2004 does not adopt a stable structure the sl1 structures of hcov-229e and nl63 appear to be fairly stable as none of the principal nucleotides forming the predicted sl1 stem structure were accessible to dms modification while several nucleotides predicted to be part of bulge or loop regions were modified by dms fig 1b and d previous analyses suggested that betacoronavirus 5-sl2 elements are made up of a 5-bp stem and a pentaloop kang et al 2006 the dms structure probing data presented in this study suggest that the sl2 elements of both hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 are composed of a 4-bp rather than 5-bp stem and a pentaloop sequence fig 1 thus for both viruses a57 positioned at the base of sl2 was regularly found to be modified by dms while none of the other adenosine and cytidine residues predicted to be part of the sl2 structures were found to be accessible to dms modification base-pairing probabilities calculated with rnafold further indicate that the basal part of hcov-229e sl2 may have a certain degree of flexibility fig 1 fig 2 furthermore the dms structure probing data obtained for hcov-nl63 and to a slightly lesser extent hcov-229e suggest that the trs-l element located downstream of sl2 is part of an unstructured region as shown in fig 1 nucleotides of the trs-l core sequence and nucleotides adjacent to the trs region were accessible to dms modification confirming that they are part of single-stranded regions in conclusion our structure model is consistent with previous betacoronavirus studies kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 yang et al 2015 and supports the idea that in most coronaviruses trs-l is part of an unstructured region rather than a stable sl structure van den born et al 2004 dufour et al 2011 see also discussion having established the existence of two conserved rna structural elements in the 5-leader regions of hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 this study and madhugiri et al 2014 we sought to investigate the functional significance of these elements in alphacoronavirus rna synthesis using a reverse genetics system developed for hcov-229e thiel et al 2001 to this end hcov-229e genome-length rnas containing appropriate nucleotide substitutions in sl1 and sl2 respectively were generated and used to investigate possible effects on viral replication in cell culture for details see material and methods using rnafold lorenz et al 2011 we predicted the most probable structures for rnas containing specific nucleotide substitutions in the hcov-229e 5-terminal genome region and based on these predictions designed a set of mutations to be introduced in the hcov-229e genome rna for subsequent cell culture studies the first set of mutants hcov-229ec11g c16g g45c and c47g contained single-nucleotide substitutions predicted to disrupt specific base-pair interactions in sl1 or sl2 resulting in a destabilization or restructuring of the respective secondary structures another set of mutants hcov-229ec11gg34c c16gg29c g45cc55g and c47gg53c contained a second compensatory mutation that restored the respective base-pairing interaction and thus preserved the stability of the stem structure fig 2 panels c e g and i for the c11g mutation computer-assisted rna structure analyses predicted a partial destabilization resulting in a larger bulge in the middle of sl1 and accordingly a reduction of the calculated minimal free energy fig 2a and b this structural change is also reflected by reduced base-pair probabilities in sl1 compare color codes in fig 2a and b suppl figure 2b restoration of the base-pair interaction between nt 11 and 34 in the hcov-229ec11gg34c mutant was predicted to preserve the wildtype rna structure fig 2a and c for the c16g mutation the calculation of base-pair probabilities fig 2d and suppl figure 2 predicted a profound destabilization of the upper segment of sl1 but also changes in adjacent regions fig 2d and suppl figure 2 again introduction of an additional compensatory mutation g29c was predicted to preserve the wildtype structure fig 2e for the g45c mutation drastic structural changes were predicted for sl2 including a significantly less stable 4-bp stem structure and a smaller loop size 3 instead of 5 nts fig 2f even more profound effects were predicted for the c47g replacement resulting in a complete destabilization of the sl2 stem structure fig 2h suppl figure 2 taken together these rna structure predictions suggested that the single-nucleotide and two-nucleotide substitutions introduced in the hcov-229e genome rna were suitable to study possible roles of the hcov-229e sl1 and sl2 structures in viral replication the predictions also confirmed that the second-site compensatory substitutions were suitable to preserve near- wildtype structures for both sl1 and sl2 to study the effects of the structural changes caused by the nucleotide substitutions in vitro transcribed full-length hcov-229e rnas wildtype and mutants respectively and n mrna were co-transfected into 90 confluent huh-7 cells at 72 h pt cell culture supernatants were collected to determine virus titers and intracellular rna was isolated for northern blot analysis of viral rna replication using a 32p-labeled probe specific for the 3 end of the genome we analyzed the full set of 3-coterminal genomic and subgenomic hcov-229e rnas we found that except for mutant c11g see below the sl1 and sl2 single-nucleotide mutants displayed severe defects in viral rna accumulation suggesting that the structural integrity of sl1 and sl2 is essential for viral replication in the case of c11g only minor defects in viral rna accumulation were observed suggesting that the stability of the basal part of sl1 is less critical with some structural flexibility being tolerated in this case however our observation that the double mutant c11gg34c with a fully preserved sl1 structure replicates more efficiently than the c11g mutant shows that an intact basal part of sl1 is beneficial though not essential for virus replication fig 2c fig 3a lane 6 interestingly similar observations were also reported for murine hepatitis virus mhv if the lower part of the presumably equivalent mhv sl1 structure was disrupted infectious virus progeny could still be recovered while disruption of the upper part proved to be lethal li et al 2008 for the hcov-229ec16g mutant a major replication defect was observed which could be reversed albeit not completely by restoring the base-pair interaction between nts 16 and 29 in sl1 c16gg29c fig 3a lane 7 for the g45c and c47g mutations in sl2 we found that both mutations cause major defects in rna replication fig 3a lanes 4 and 5 the corresponding double mutant hcov-229eg45cc55g replicated with near-wildtype efficiency while viral rna accumulation was not fully restored in the double mutant c47gg53c suggesting additional constraints taken together the mutagenesis study shows that the structural integrity of sl2 is essential for efficient hcov-229e replication similar observations were previously made for the betacoronavirus mhv where nucleotide substitutions that destabilized the sl2 stem region resulted in a drastic reduction of viral rna synthesis and production of infectious virus progeny liu et al 2007 as mentioned above all double mutants replicated more efficiently than their single-mutation counterparts fig 3a lanes 25 and 69 providing strong evidence for the existence and functional relevance of the hcov-229e sl1 and sl2 structures previous betacoronavirus studies suggested that with few exceptions preservation of the sl1 and sl2 secondary structures is more important for viral replication than preservation of a specific nucleotide sequence liu et al 2007 li et al 2008 by and large our functional analysis of the hcov-229e sl1 and sl2 elements supports these earlier proposals of the leibowitz and giedroc laboratories for the sl1 and sl2 equivalents in mhv for the hcov-220ec11gg34c and g45cc55g mutants we were able to show that rna synthesis returned to wildtype levels if the base-pairing potential was restored by introducing appropriate compensatory mutations fig 3a lane 6 and 8 in contrast genome replication and sg mrna synthesis and virus progeny production see below did not revert to wildtype levels in the case of c16gg29c and c47gg53c even though the stem structures were restored in these mutants fig 3a lanes 7 and 9 our results strongly suggest that not only the sl1 and sl2 structures but also the nucleotide sequence plays an important role in rna synthesis and the production of infectious virus progeny see below along with the analysis of viral rna accumulation we measured virus titers in the supernatants of transfected cells fig 3b titers are given as mean values and standard error of the mean  sem and were determined from three independent transfection experiments in all sl1 and sl2 mutants transfection of full-length wildtype or mutant genome rna gave rise to infectious virus progeny but virus titers varied greatly among the different mutants fig 3b substitution of c11 with g resulted in an approximately 10-fold reduced titer compared to the wildtype virus consistent with the moderate reduction in viral rna synthesis observed for this mutant fig 3a lane 2 in contrast the c16g g45c and c47g substitutions caused a drastic 1001000-fold reduction of virus titers suggesting severe defects in viral replication upon restoration of the base pairing in the sl1c11gg34c and sl2g45cc55g sl2 mutants the production of infectious virus progeny returned to near wildtype levels consistent with the northern blot data presented above restoration of base-pairing interactions in the c16gg29c and c47gg53c mutants failed to restore the full replication potential overall the titers obtained for the hcov-229e sl1 and sl2 mutants correlate very well with the rna replication data fig 3a suggesting that the introduced mutations primarily affect viral rna synthesis rather than a late step in the viral life cycle as illustrated in fig 2 single-nucleotide substitutions in the stem of sl2 were predicted to cause major structural rearrangements and consistent with the presumed cis-acting function of this element resulted in severe defects in viral rna synthesis and reproduction fig 3 to test if the introduced mutations were stable enough to allow their phenotypes to be analyzed in passage 0 p0 we subjected viral rnas isolated from p0 virus stocks of the sl1 and sl2 mutants to partial genome sequence analyses covering the entire 5-utr and 3-utr regions in all cases the introduced mutations were found to be retained suggesting that the virus titration and northern blot data shown fig 3 reflect true phenotypes of the sl1 and sl2 mutants generated in this study only in one case sl2c47g we obtained evidence for a rapid reversion back to the wildtype sequence as shown in fig 4a we observed an additional c peak at position 47 to corroborate this observation the c47g mutant was subjected to 5 serial passages in huh-7 cells fig 4b and rna isolated from virus-infected cells was used for sequence analysis the sequence data confirmed a complete replacement of the c47-to-g mutation with the wildtype nucleotide c47 thereby restoring the watson-crick base pairing of nucleotides 47 and 53 in this revertant fig 4c the data lead us to suggest a critical role for the c47-g53 base pair in supporting specific sl2 structure-function relationships required for coronavirus rna synthesis the data also suggest that the low titer determined for the c47g p0 virus stock may represent an overestimate of the real replication efficiency of the c47g mutant because even at this early time point pt a significant proportion of virus genomes had reverted to the wildtype sequence we did not observe reversions or second-site substitutions in the sl2-c47gg53c double mutant where watson-crick base pairing was restored fig 2 suggesting that rna synthesis and viral reproduction although being reduced compared to the wildtype were sufficient for virus growth in cell culture nevertheless the partial growth defect of this double mutant indicates that not only the helical stem structure but also the sequence might play a role in viral rna synthesis fig 3 genus-wide consensus secondary structural models indicated that the 5-terminal 150 nt of alpha- and betacoronaviruses folds into three highly conserved structures that are generally referred to as sl1 sl2 and sl4 madhugiri et al 2014 madhugiri et al 2016 yang and leibowitz 2015 this conservation is illustrated in fig 5a for 4 coronaviruses representing the genera alpha- and betacoronavirus previous studies suggested that sl2 represents the most conserved rna structural element in coronavirus genomes kang et al 2006 chen and olsthoorn 2010 as illustrated for 4 representative coronaviruses in fig 5b sl2 is always comprised of a 5-base-pair helical stem and in most cases a pentaloop structure the loop sequence 5-cuuuguc3 is highly conserved while the stem sequence is variable fig 5c previous studies in betacoronavirus systems revealed that intra-genus replacements of 5-terminal rna structural elements may result in viable viruses kang et al 2006 supporting the high degree of both structural and functional conservation among betacoronavirus cis-acting elements in the 5 genome region these earlier and our own studies led us to suggest that several rna structural elements in the 5 and 3 utrs are not only conserved among alphacoronaviruses but also across different genera of the coronavirinae madhugiri et al 2014 to test this hypothesis we constructed a mutant in which the hcov-229e sl1 was replaced with the equivalent structure of hcov-nl63 transfection of in vitro-transcribed hcov-229e genome rna containing this intra-genus replacement gave rise to infectious virus progeny that replicated to near-wildtype titers fig 6 confirming the functional conservation of this structure among alphacoronaviruses as the sl2 sequences of hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 are identical a replacement of the sl2 structures was dispensable instead we decided to study the extent of sl2 conservation across genus boundaries by extending our studies to the sl2 elements of betacoronaviruses to our knowledge inter-genus exchanges of cis-acting elements in coronavirus 5-proximal genome regions have not been performed previously using the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetics system we replaced the hcov-229e sl2 structure in the full-length hcov-229e cdna sequence with the structural counterpart from bcov and sars-cov respectively representing different lineages of the genus betacoronavirus in vitro-transcribed full-length chimeric and wildtype hcov-229e genome rnas were transfected into huh-7 cells at 72 h pt virus titers in cell culture supernatants collected from transfected cells were determined from three independent transfection experiments in all cases we were able to recover infectious virus progeny fig 7 exchange of the hcov-229e sl2 with that of bcov resulted in a viral titer of 103 tcid50ml fig 7a while a replacement with the sl2 of sars-cov resulted in significantly lower titers fig 7a and slightly smaller plaques sizes compared to the parental hcov-229e virus fig 7c sequence analyses of cdna obtained from the chimeric virus progeny confirmed that the exchanges introduced into the hcov-229e genome were retained fig 7d and no additional second-site mutations were identified in the 5- and 3-utrs in the recovered viruses furthermore we passaged the chimeric viruses blindly for six times titration of these serially passaged viruses revealed near-wildtype growth for the virus carrying the bcov sl2 while the virus carrying the sars-cov structure replicated to slightly lower titers fig 7d the increase in titers might be due to the accumulation of compensatory mutations to address this possibility viral cdna produced from the p6 virus stocks of the bcov-sl2 and sars-sl2 mutants respectively were subjected to sequence analysis covering the entire 5- and 3-utrs and the replicase gene sequences encoding nsp7 to 12 analysis of the consensus sequence of the virus stocks confirmed that the introduced sl2 replacements were retained after six passages data not shown and no compensatory mutations were detected in this partial genome sequence analysis to understand how these chimeric viruses evolved to almost wild-type like titers while retaining the engineered substitutions complete sequence analyses of single plaque-purified high-passage chimeric viruses remain to be performed in future studies taken together these inter-genus exchange data provide experimental proof for our hypothesis that several coronavirus cis-acting rna elements are conserved both structurally and functionally among different coronavirus genera as shown in fig 3 nucleotide substitutions predicted to destabilize sl2 cause major defects in hcov-229e rna synthesis and virus reproduction demonstrating the functional relevance of this sl structure interestingly the helical sl2 stem of most coronaviruses is composed of three a-u and two g-c base pairs respectively fig 5a and b fig 8a we therefore asked the question of whether this pattern of base-pair interactions reflects a finely balanced stability of this structure to address this question we stabilized the sl2 structure by introducing 4 mutations the mutations replaced two au base pairs at positions 4456 and 4654 with gc base pairs and were predicted to decrease the minimal free energy of this secondary structure fig 8 an in vitro-transcribed full-length genome rna containing this set of mutations and a wildtype control rna respectively were transfected into huh-7 cells and virus titers in cell culture supernatants collected at 72 h pt were determined in repeated experiments we failed to recover viable virus containing these stabilizing mutations in the stem region of sl2 while the wild-type virus was readily recovered with high titers the data demonstrate specific sequence requirements for the sl2 stem region it remains to be studied in further experiments if these sequence constraints reflect a requirement for an optimal stability of sl2 or rather the presence of specific nucleotides at specific positions in this study we used a combined bioinformatics biochemical and reverse genetics approach to characterize the structures and functions of the putative cis-acting sl1 and sl2 elements of the alphacoronavirus hcov-229e madhugiri et al 2014 madhugiri et al 2016 yang and leibowitz 2015 based on rna structure probing information obtained for in vitro-transcribed rnas representing appropriate genome sequences of hcov-229e and a second alphacoronavirus hcov-nl63 combined with bioinformatics studies we present a robust rna secondary structure model for the 5-terminal 80 nts of the hcov-229e genome that we think to be representative for other alphacoronaviruses we also provide evidence that i the sl1 and sl2 rna structural elements are required for viral replication and ii the structures and functions of these elements are conserved among alphacoronaviruses and probably betacoronaviruses the study revealed a number of interesting parallels to the sl1 and sl2 elements of betacoronaviruses which have been characterized extensively in previous studies and shown to be required for bcov and mhv genome replication and sg mrna synthesis kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a li et al 2008 the rna structure probing data presented in this study fig 1 are consistent with models developed previously for a range of beta- and to a lesser extent alphacoronaviruses kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 liu et al 2009a li et al 2008 madhugiri et al 2014 yang et al 2015 the probing information provides experimental support for the presence of stable sl1 and sl2 structures in the 5-terminal genome region and suggests that the trs-l together with flanking sequences is part of an unstructured region the latter conclusion is consistent with previous studies in which the trs-l was proposed to be located in an unstructured region in the majority of coronavirus genomes liu et al 2007 madhugiri et al 2014 yang et al 2015 furthermore most structure prediction applications place or can be forced to place the coronavirus trs-l in sl structures that would only be supported by two conserved base pairs arguing against a major role of such a structure raman et al 2003 liu et al 2007 chen and olsthoorn 2010 yang et al 2015 madhugiri et al 2016 in this context it should be noted that there is also evidence that in a subset of alphacoronaviruses tgev betacoronaviruses including bcov and gammacoronaviruses an additional structural element sl3 also called sl-ii in several bcov studies may exist for example studies on the trs-l element of tgev using nmr spectroscopy uv thermal denaturation experiments and a reverse genetics approach suggested the existence of a defined hairpin structure in this genome region dufour et al 2011 most of the tgev trs-l core sequence was proposed to be located in a heptaloop region of a hairpin structure with moderate possibly optimized thermal stability both the structure and stability of this trs-l hairpin structure was shown to play a role in tgev replication and transcription where it was proposed to act as a landing platform for the nascent minus-strand rna similar to the similarity-assisted rna recombination model proposed earlier by nagy et al nagy and simon 1997 taken together the available information suggests that the trs-l region may be structurally flexible and adopt alternative structures to regulate specific steps of viral rna synthesis the hcov-229e mutagenesis data obtained in our reverse genetics study of sl1 and sl2 mutants provide experimental support for the functional relevance of these elements in viral replication based on computer-assisted structure predictions for sl1 and sl2 variants containing specific mutations in stem regions a set of mutants was designed in which the respective structures were destabilized or disrupted possible effects of the mutations on viral replication were subsequently studied in cell culture the mutagenesis data obtained for the sl1 mutants confirm a critical role for sl1 in hcov-229e replication the data also revealed that destabilizing mutations in the upper and lower parts of the sl1 structure have quite different effects on viral replication furthermore the incomplete restoration of the in vitro growth characteristics of the c16gg29e mutant suggests additional sequence constraints which remain to be investigated in further studies the less critical role observed for c11 which acts to stabilize the lower part of sl1 in viral replication and the observation that the double mutant c11gg34c replicated with near-wildtype characteristics suggest that the lower part of sl1 tolerates some structural changes possibly indicating flexibility in this part of the structure these observations are reminiscent of data reported by the giedroc laboratory for mhv li et al 2008 in this case the upper part of the sl1 stem was found to be required for efficient mhv replication while a less stable structure of the lower part was largely tolerated interestingly the mhv study also detected second-site suppressor mutations in the 5- and 3-utrs in some of the sl1 mutants based on these second-site mutations a dynamic sl1 model was proposed in which the lower part of sl1 is required to have an optimized flexibility to mediate physical interactions between the 5- and 3-utrs that for example may stimulate sg mrna synthesis to date we failed to detect any second-site suppressor mutations in the 5- and 3-utrs of hcov-229e in our sl1 mutants possible reasons for this discrepancy from the mhv data remain to be studied but may relate to the more drastic deletion mutations introduced in the mhv sl1 structure which may have forced the development and fixation of compensatory mutations in the mhv mutants li et al 2008 while in our own study single-nucleotide substitutions were introduced in the hcov-229e sl1 as mentioned above sl2 represents the most conserved cis-acting rna element in coronaviruses kang et al 2006 chen and olsthoorn 2010 suggesting an important function in coronavirus replication our hcov-229e sl2 mutagenesis data strongly support this hypothesis thus any disruption of g-c base pair interactions predicted to destabilize the hcov-229e sl2 stem structure fig 2f and h caused major defects in viral replication fig 3 while restoration of the helical stem in the double mutant g45cc55g resulted in a wildtype phenotype fig 3 surprisingly the other double mutant c47gg53c that was predicted to preserve the sl2 stem structure fig 2 panel i was found to have partial defects in rna replication and production of infectious virus progeny fig 3 furthermore the rapid reversion of the c47g mutant to the wildtype sequence fig 4 indicates a strong selection pressure to maintain this particular base pair interaction while our mutagenesis data combined with extensive mhv sl2 mutagenesis studies kang et al 2006 liu et al 2007 establish an essential role for sl2 in alpha- and betacoronavirus replication more studies will be required to investigate the precise roles of residues in the hcov-229e sl2 stem and loop regions including base pair interactions within the loop or at its base c47 and possibly also unravel the special role of the c47-g53 pair in the function of sl2 based on our own and other studies see below it was tempting to suggest that the structurally conserved 5-proximal cis-acting rna elements including sl1 and sl2 may also be functionally conserved across coronavirus genera to test this idea we constructed hcov-229e mutants in which the cognate sl2 element was replaced with that of bcov and sars-cov respectively our study was guided by earlier bioinformatic analyses madhugiri et al 2014 that suggested conservation of rna secondary structures in the utrs of viruses from the same genus but also other coronavirus genera previously such a structural and functional conservation had only been confirmed for members of the same genus goebel et al 2004 kang et al 2006 in the present study we were able to extend these previous conclusions to alphacoronaviruses by showing that a replacement of the hcov-229e sl1 with the equivalent structure from hcov-nl63 fig 6 was tolerated very well with titers of the chimeric virus approaching that of the wildtype virus more importantly we were able to show that the sl2s of bcov and sars-cov respectively can act at least in part as functional substitutes for the cognate sl2 structure in the hcov-229e genome to our knowledge this is the first experimental proof that the 5-terminal sl2 is both structurally and functionally conserved among alpha- and betacoronaviruses in line with previous studies kang et al 2006 the four coronaviruses included in the present study representing the genera alpha- and betacoronavirus share a short 45-bp helical stem and a highly conserved pentaloop sequence 5-ucuugu-3 fig 5 although the sequence of the predicted helical stems is not conserved fig 5c viable viruses carrying the bcov or sars-cov sl2 counterparts could be recovered as confirmed by virus titration and sequence analysis fig 7a and d we did not observe second-site mutations in the introduced sl2 structures and the entire 5- and 3-utr regions in virus stocks collected at 72 h pt p0 and after serial passaging p6 respectively fig 7 complete genome analyses of plaque-purified mutants remain to be performed in future studies to exclude compensatory mutations in other genome regions although several features are conserved among alpha- and betacoronavirus sl2 structures which may explain the functionality of the betacoronavirus sl2 structure in an alphacoronavirus context more studies are required to fully understand the critical parameters required for the sl2 functions in virus replication one of these parameters might be an optimal stability of the 45-bp stem of sl2 in this context the observed lethal phenotype of an hcov-229e mutant carrying an sl2 with two additional g-c base pairs fig 8 provides preliminary evidence to suggest that both the nucleotide sequence and the stability of the stem may play a more important role than previously thought and thus deserve further studies taken together our functional characterization of alphacoronavirus sl1 and sl2 elements strongly supports the idea that despite very limited sequence conservation a number of cis-acting rna elements including sl1 and sl2 are structurally conserved and have similar functions in coronavirus replication  genome detective

around the world in the end of january 2020 the who has declared it a global emergency who 2020 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first isolated in wuhan china has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak of 2002 and 2003 the virus is a sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov and it is genetically associated with sarsr-cov strains that infect bats in china lu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 it causes severe respiratory illness which the who recently named covid-19 disease it has high fatality rate huang et al 2020 can be transmitted from person to person has infected over 70 000 individuals and has spread to over 30 countries in less than 2 months who 2020 this coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it they have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously this has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response here we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes the tool also identifies changes at nucleotides coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations fig 1 a reference dataset of previously published coronavirus whole-genome sequences wgs was compiled from the virus pathogen resource vipr database wwwviprbrcorg this dataset consisted of 386 wgs of nine important coronavirus species these included 132

guindon and gascuel 2003 lemoine et al 2018 and a bayesian tree using mrbayes ronquist and huelsenbeck 2003 were constructed the trees were visualized in figtree rambaut 2018 we selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster with bootstrap support of 100 and posterior probability of 1 we identified five well-supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of sarsr-cov and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool cluster 1 included sars strains from the 2002 and 2003 asian outbreaks in our tool we named this cluster sars-cov outbreak 2000s but may rename it as sars-cov-1 if a new proposed naming system for sarsr-cov is adopted in the near future cluster 2 provisionally named as sars related cov includes seven sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks cluster 3 named as bat sars-cov hku3 includes three wgs sampled from rhinolophus sinicus ie chinese rufous horseshoe bats

genome of sars-cov-2 was kindly shared by prof yong-zhen zhang and colleagues in the virologicalorg website detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets is available in supplementary table s2 the phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated coronavirus typing tool using the genome detective framework fonseca et al 2019 vilsker et al 2019 to determine the accuracy of this tool each of the 431 test wgs was considered for evaluation ie 384 reference sequences from vipr and 47 public sars-cov-2 sequences the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of our method were calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of sarsr-cov sensitivity was computed by the formula tptpfn specificity by tntnfp and accuracy by tptntpfpfntn where tp  true

levels in the second step a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the mafft software katoh and standley 2013 in addition a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the hky distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1000 bootstrap replicates using paup swofford 2003 the query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support 70 if the bootstrap support is 70 the genotype is reported to be unassigned the result of the phylogenetic and mutational analysis performed by aga is available in a detailed report this report contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper

sensitivity and accuracy of 100 furthermore all of the 47 sars-cov-2 wgs that were isolated in china n  36 usa n  5 france n  2 thailand n  2 japan n  1 and taiwan n  1 were correctly classified at phylogenetic cluster level as sars-cov-2 which may be renamed as sars-b in addition we classified with very high specificity sensitivity and accuracy ie 100 all of the 112 sars outbreak wgs of 2002

nucleotide nt identity was 790 to the reference strain of sarsr-cov accession nc0047183 and that the envelop small membrane protein protein e is the most similar protein in total 948 7377 of the amino acids were identical the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 t55s 56 v56f 69 69deletion and 70 g70r the spike protein protein s which can be associated with virulence was 762 identical to the reference strain of sarsr-cov supplementary table s4a interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 a237f238inshrsy genome nt position 2220222203inscatagaagttat which is just upstream from a cleavage site there is also a four amino acid insertion prra at the spike protein at positions 681 to 684 this is at the junction of s1 and s2 and creates a new polybase

wgs in fasta format takes approximately 60 s we developed and released the genome detective coronavirus typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of january 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of covid-19 infections this tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes it accepts assembled genomes in fasta format or raw next-generation sequencing data in fastq format from illumina ion torrent pacbio or oxford nanopore technologies ont can be submitted to the genome detective virus tool vilsker et al 2019 to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the coronavirus typing tool user effort is minimal and a user can submit multiple fasta sequences at once the tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner aga to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores this allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally it also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins moreover it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes the tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released sars-cov-2 genomes as well as all the 20022003 sars outbreak

ser10ala glu14ala ser139ala and phe140ala were prepared with the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit stratagene using pqe30-sars-cov 3clpro as a template the nucleotide sequences of the primers used for mutation were given in table 1 the pqe30-sars-cov 3clpro plasmids encoding mutated forms of sars-cov 3clpro were verified by sequencing and then escherichia coli m15 cells were transformed by the resulting plasmids the mutated proteins were expressed and purified in a similar procedure to that for the wild type protease the purity and structural integrity of the mutated proteases were analysed by sdspage n-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry the concentrated proteins were stored in 20 mm trishcl ph 75 100 mm nacl 5 mm dtt 1 mm edta at 20c
 
circular dichroism cd spectra were recorded on a jasco-810 spectropolarimeter the protein sample was prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate ph 75 100 mm nacl at 25c with concentration of 10 m far-uv cd spectra from 190 to 250 nm were collected with 1 nm band width using 01 cm path length cuvette and normalized by subtracting the baseline recorded for the buffer each measurement was repeated thrice and the final result was the average of three independent scans the far-uv cd spectra of the mutated proteases were compared with that of the wild type sars-cov 3clpro to exclude the possibility of structural misfolding caused by single point mutation the fluorescence experiments were performed on a hitachi f-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer the protease sample was prepared in 20 mm trishcl ph 75 100 mm nacl with concentration of 5 m the fluorescence emission spectra from 300 to 380 nm were collected after excitation at 280 nm and the spectral slit width was 5 nm for excitation and emission fluorescence spectra of the wild type and mutated sars-cov 3clpros were measured in a 1 ml quartz cuvette with 1 cm path length at 25c all final spectra were corrected for the buffer contribution and were the average of three parallel measurements for the wild type and mutated sars-cov 3clpros final concentration from 02 to 5 mgml in 20 mm trishcl ph 75 100 mm nacl 5 mm dtt 1 mm edta an aliquot of 25 vv glutaraldehyde was added to make a final concentration of 005 or 01 glutaraldehyde the samples were incubated at 25c for 15 min followed by quenching the reaction with the addition of 10 m trishcl ph 80 05 vv orthophosphoric acid was thereafter added into the reaction mixture to result in precipitation of the cross-linked proteins after centrifugation 12000 rpm 4c the precipitate was re-dissolved in loading buffer and heated at 100c for 5 min sdspage was run with 10 gels the dimermonomer equilibria of the wild type and mutated sars-cov 3clpros were analysed by size-exclusion chromatography sec on a hiload 1660 superdex 75 prep grade column through an akta fplc system amersham biosciences buffer used was 20 mm trishcl ph 75 100 mm nacl 5 mm dtt and 1 mm edta the buffer was degassed and the column was equilibrated with the buffer before injecting protein samples protein samples with a concentration of 5 mgml were loaded on the column and then eluted with the buffer at a flow rate of 1 mlmin by detection of absorbance at 280 nm the integrated area values of absorbance peaks were calibrated by akta fplc evaluation software the column was calibrated using a low molecular mass gel filtration kit amersham biosciences with four marker proteins ribonuclease a 137 kda chymotrypsinogen a 250 kda ovalbumin 430 kda and albumin 670 kda the catalytic activities of the wild type and mutated sars-cov 3clpros were measured by fret-based assays using a 12-amino acid fluorogenic substrate edans-vnstlqsglrk dabcyl-m according to our published studies 23 24 during the continuously kinetic assay the protease final concentration 1 m was pre-incubated for 30 min at 25c with the assay buffer 20 mm trishcl ph 75 100 mm nacl 5 mm dtt and 1 mm edta followed by the addition of the fluorogenic substrate final concentration 10 m the fluorescence intensity was monitored on a genios microplate reader tecan mnnedorf switzerland and the instrument was first set to zero with the fluorogenic substrate cleavage of the substrate as a function of time was measured by the increase in emission fluorescence intensity upon continuous monitoring of reactions in a 96-well black microplate bmg labtech offenburg germany using wavelengths of 340 nm and 488 nm for excitation and emission respectively the incubation of the substrate in the assay buffer without the protease was also performed as a control enzymatic activity was the average of three parallel assays and the activity of the wild type sars-cov 3clpro was taken as 100 to predict the key factors that maintain the stability of the dimer interface 5-ns cmd simulations were firstly conducted on the dimer of sars-cov 3clpro all interactive residues between monomer a and b as shown in fig 1c were monitored for the time occupancy during the whole simulation process the hydrogen bonds formed on the dimer interface were calculated by using hplus 25 interestingly more than 10 hydrogen bonding interactions occupy most time of simulation table 2 suggesting that the residues involved in these interactions might possibly make well contributions to keep the dimer conformational stability guided by this potential information we selected seven residues on the dimer interface for site-directed mutagenesis fig 1a these residues are mainly involved in the dimerization of sars-cov 3clpro through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with their side-chain or main-chain groups fig 2 and single ala substitution might perturb the entirety of the hydrogen bonding networks on the dimer interface
 according to the preparation strategy previously reported in our lab 22 we expressed sars-cov 3clpro as an n-terminal his-tagged protein for purification convenience considering the results shown in several other publications 10 15 26 27 that n-terminal extra amino acids eg the purification affinity tag might interfere with dimerization of sars-cov 3clpro we also constructed the protease into a vector without affinity tag and evaluated the dimerization feature of the un-tagged protein while there are no obvious differences observed for the dimermonomer equilibrium in solution between the two purified proteases data not shown thus we performed all subsequent assays with the n-terminal his-tagged 3clpro similar with the wild type protease all the seven single point mutants were also successfully cloned and expressed in e coli m15 cells the majority of the proteins could be obtained in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate sdspage analyses indicated that all mutated proteases are highly homogeneous in solution although the corresponding protein bands in sdspage would shift little faster than the molar marker of 350 kda the recombinant proteins have been clearly identified as sars-cov 3clpro with a molecular mass of 358 kda by mass spectrometric characterization data not shown in agreement with the values calculated from the protein sequences and the published data from our laboratory 22 
figure 3 shows the far-uv cd spectra of the wild type and seven mutants of sars-cov 3clpro the spectra of the seven mutated proteases seem to be similar to that of the wild type sars-cov 3clpro all spectra give a positive peak at 196 nm and dual negative peaks at 209 and 222 nm typical of a mixture of -helical and -sheet structures these results indicated that all seven mutated proteases have well-defined secondary structures and excluded the possibility of structural misfolding caused by single residue mutation however small changes of the cd spectra do exist as shown in fig 3 which might be due to minor structural changes induced by ala mutations
 the fluorescence emission spectra of the wild type and seven mutants of sars-cov 3clpro are also shown in fig 4 the emission max of the wild type sars-cov 3clpro is 325 nm similar to the wild type protease all seven mutated proteins show only minor difference on the emission max varying from 324 nm to 327 nm further demonstrating that replacement of single residue on the dimer interface by ala has not changed the folding manner of the protease
 similar to 3cl proteases of human coronavirus hcov 229e and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev 28 sars-cov 3clpro can form a dimer in the crystal structure and solution 6 13 the dimerization features of sars-cov 3clpro have been successfully characterized by various biochemical and biophysical methods 79 12 according to the published method 29 we first performed the chemical cross-linking analysis of the wild type sars-cov 3clpro when incubated with 005 glutaraldehyde the protease at a concentration of 02 mgml displayed a form of monomer near 350 kda with the other band corresponding to the dimer fig 5a lane 6b with protein concentration increasing both of the dimeric and monomeric forms increased fig 5a lanes 5b3b a similar cross-linking pattern of the protease was observed when using a higher concentration of glutaraldehyde 01 excluding the possibility of obvious artificial cross-linking effects fig 5a lanes 6a3a these results indicate that the wild type protease exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer at varying concentrations which is consistent with the reported studies 7 8
 to preliminarily examine the effects of ala mutations of the selected seven residues on dimerization of sars-cov 3clpro the chemical cross-linking analyses of the mutated proteases were also performed respectively conclusively all seven mutated proteases displayed similar cross-linking patterns with the wild type protease fig 5bh the dimeric form of each mutated protease also existed within a wide range of protein concentrations suggesting that mutation of single residue on the dimer interface could not completely abolish the dimeric structure of sars-cov 3clpro in solution however moderate differences of dimermonomer equilibria do exist among these mutants for the ser10ala and glu14ala mutants fig 5e and f the amount of the dimer was relatively low compared with the wild type and other mutated proteases indicating that the -helix a of domain i might be an important part of the dimer interface and relatively contribute more to maintain the dimer stability of sars-cov 3clpro in addition we should note that the possibility of minor artificial cross-linking effects might still exist due to the appearance of the high-order multimers in sdspage fig 5 while considering the chemical cross-linking analyses of the wild type and mutant proteases were performed under exactly same experimental procedures these analyses might still be convincing to preliminarily examine the effects of these mutations on dimerization of sars-cov 3clpro in order to more exactly evaluate the perturbation of dimermonomer equilibrium caused by these mutations we performed sec analyses to further characterize the wild type and mutated sars-cov 3clpros we used a protein concentration at 5 mgml for each run which represents the highest concentration used in the cross-linking experiments and the physical states corresponding to native monomeric and dimeric protease were observed as shown in fig 6a the wild type sars-cov 3clpro elutes in two peaks with the retention volumes at 446 and 621 ml the elution profiles of four molecular mass marker proteins confirmed that the first peak might correspond to the dimer state 716 kda and the second peak would represent the monomeric species of sars-cov 3clpro 358 kda in well agreement with the reported result 8 we also collected the fractions representing these two elution peaks and analysed them by sdspage and the corresponding protein bands further indicated that both of these two peaks are sars-cov 3clpro data not shown the amount of the dimer and monomer could be further quantified by the integrated area values of these two peaks and the dimermonomer ratio of the wild type protease was estimated as 102 table 3 this observation thus indicates that in solution the wild type protease exhibits both forms of monomer and dimer and the amount of the monomer is almost equal to that of the dimeric form in well agreement with the chemical cross-linking analysis and literature report 13
 for the seven mutated proteases under identical conditions the two elution-peaks representing the dimer and monomer states were also monitored respectively fig 6bh the results demonstrate that dimerization of sars-cov 3clpro could not be disrupted entirely by mutation of single residue on the dimer interface further supporting the chemical cross-linking results compared with the wild type protease these mutants showed minor drifts on the retention volumes of the two elution peaks table 3 varying from 434 ml to 458 ml and from 592 ml to 634 ml indicative of possible subtle conformational changes of the dimer and monomer structures furthermore the dimermonomer ratios of these mutants differentiated significantly from each other table 3 implying that the contributions of these residues to the monomerdimer equilibrium of sars-cov 3clpro are quite different for the ser1ala phe3ala and ser139ala mutants the ratios between the dimers and monomers were 108 093 and 081 respectively which indicates that these three residues could only affect the dimer interface stability to a lesser extent for the other mutants especially the arg4ala and glu14ala mutants the dimermonomer ratios decreased obviously and were nearly 2 to 3-fold lower than that of the wild type protease suggesting that the amount of the dimer has decreased and the monomer is the predominant form overall glu14 arg4 phe140 and ser10 in decreasing order on the dimer interface are the relatively more critical residues for stabilizing the dimeric structure of sars-cov 3clpro several published results have proposed that only the dimer should be the biological functional form of sars-cov 3clpro and the dissociated monomer might be enzymatic inactive 13 30 meanwhile alteration of the correct conformation of the dimeric structure could also lead to a complete loss of the catalytic activity 8 14 although ala replacement of single residue on the dimer interface could not completely result in the dimer dissociation in solution the seven residues we selected still might affect the catalytic activity of sars-cov 3clpro considering their contributions to stabilize the monomermonomer interface to verify this prediction we determined the enzymatic activities of the wild type and seven mutated proteases by a fluorogenic substrate reported previously in our lab 23 24 the catalytic activity of sars-cov 3clpro and relevant inhibitors screening have been characterized extensively by the fret-based assay 26 3133 as shown in fig 7 the fluorescence increase following hydrolysis of the substrate by the wild type sars-cov 3clpro is significant and time-dependent implying that the protease could hydrolyze the substrate efficiently as expected the fluorescence profiles of the seven mutants were obviously different from that of the wild type protease fig 7 which indicates that mutation of these residues could inactivate the catalytic activity of sars-cov 3clpro to varying extents in detail mutation of residues ser10 and phe140 almost produced the complete loss of the enzymatic activity and the catalytic activities of the phe3ala glu14ala and arg4ala mutants were also decreased to only 410 of that of the wild type protease table 4 while the mutants of ser1ala and ser139ala still possessed 46 and 58 of enzymatic activity respectively table 4 these results further support the conclusions derived from the sec analyses that the extensive monomermonomer interactions regulated by these residues could stabilize the dimeric structure at different degrees however it is noticeable that the influence of these mutations on the catalytic activity is more obvious than that on dimerization of sars-cov 3clpro which will be discussed below
 proteolytic processing of the non-structural polyproteins is a vital step in the replication cycle of coronavirus and such processing is commonly performed by virus-genome encoded proteases including 3clpro 4 3436 therefore 3clpro has been appreciated as an attractive target in discovering anti-coronavirus agents 5 sars-cov 3clpro shares high homology with the 3clpros of other coronaviruses and the 3d structures of different coronavirus 3clpros are more conserved than their sequences 6 37 sars-cov 3clpro has been extensively characterized for its structural property and enzymatic activity 8 9 1215 27 38 39 the protease can form a homodimer in crystal and solution fig 1a and b and the dimeric structure is proposed to be indispensable for enzymatic activity much progress has been made for understanding the correlation between dimerization and catalytic activity of sars-cov 3clpro 710 12 27 30 recently a systematic mutagenesis study reported an initial attempt to map the dimerization interface on the helical domain iii of the protease 11 in the present study we focused another seven residues on the dimer interface of sars-cov 3clpro for single point mutagenesis fig 1a these selected residues are predicted to involve in dimerization mainly through hydrogen bonding table 2 and fig 2 structurally the seven mutated proteases could be divided into three groups the first group includes ser1ala phe3ala and arg4ala mutants regarding three residues on the n-terminal finger of sars-cov 3clpro the n-terminal finger of one monomer can form intensive interactions with domain ii of the other monomer 6 fig 2a eg the nh group of ser1 in monomer b donates hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl of phe140 in monomer a as well as the side-chain carboxylate of glu166a and the side-chain oh group of ser1b forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain nh group of phe140a in addition the nh group of phe3b donates a hydrogen bond to the side-chain oh group of ser139a this pair of hydrogen bond might be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the side-chain phenyl of phe3b and the neighbouring residues eg leu282b and phe291b whereas replacement of residue ser1 or phe3 by ala rendered little influence on the dimermonomer equilibrium of sars-cov 3clpro fig 5b c and table 3 indicating that these two residues might not play a vital role in dimerization the results are in agreement with a reported study that the n-terminal residues13 truncated protease still exhibits a tendency to form dimer 9 the ser1ala mutant maintained 46 of enzymatic activity and the activity of the phe3ala mutant was nearly 10-fold lower than that of the wild type protease table 4 implying that in addition to dimerization residues ser1 and phe3 could regulate the catalytic activity of the protease by other mechanisms according to the crystal structure fig 2a the monomermonomer interactions mediated by ser1 and phe3 might be helpful to maintain the correct catalytic conformation of the s1 subsite and mutation of ser1 or phe3 possibly induces an altered uncompetitive conformation of the s1 subsite nevertheless this hypothesis should be verified by the crystal structures determination of these two mutated proteases besides ser1 and phe3 another residue arg4 was also selected for mutagenesis study the side-chain guanidyl of arg4 in one monomer forms a salt bridge with the side-chain of glu290 in the other monomer fig 2a which has been reported as one of the major interactions between the two monomers 12 here arg4ala mutant was shown to a tendency to monomer state table 3 and a very weak enzymatic activity table 4 further demonstrating the importance of the arg4-mediated interactions in the quaternary structure and activity of the protease although the role of the n-terminal finger has been assessed by many investigations 9 10 our results revealed that the residues on the n-terminal finger indeed contribute differently to the dimer stability and catalytic activity of sars-cov 3clpro the second group of the mutants is about ser10ala and glu14ala which are related to two residues on the -helix a of domain i of sars-cov 3clpro the two residues are highly conserved among different coronavirus 3cl proteases and also extensively involved in monomermonomer interactions fig 1c residue ser10 from each monomer can form a pair of hydrogen bond between the main-chain nh group and the side-chain oh group and the side-chain carboxylate of glu14 in one monomer donates a hydrogen bond with the main-chain nh group of gly11 in the other monomer fig 2b in the present study both of the two mutants were shown to weak dimerization fig 5ef and table 3 and have no detectable enzyme activity either table 4 indicating that the -helix a of domain i might also be a critical region for dimerization structurally the -helix a residues ser10-gly15 connects to the n-terminal finger of sars-cov 3clpro and might determine the correct spatial orientation of the n-terminal finger fig 2b in the dimer structure the n-terminal finger can squeeze into the space between domain iii of its parent monomer and domain ii of the neighbouring monomer which is indispensable for maintaining the correct catalytic conformation of the protease 6 8 mutation of ser10 or glu14 to ala is possible to partly disrupt the structure of the -helix a and produce a mis-oriented n-terminal finger thus making the protease completely inactive however this conclusion should be further confirmed by the crystal structures of the corresponding mutated proteases unpublished data from this laboratory in addition we also performed another group of mutants including ser139ala and phe140ala these two residues are located in the oxyanion loop residues 138145 of domain ii and involved in the dimer interface by interacting with the n-terminus residues of the other monomer fig 2a the oxyanion loop is associated with the formation of the s1 subsite in the substrate-binding pocket which determines the absolute specificity of sars-cov 3clpro for glu in the p1 position of the substrate 6 14 the oxyanion loop is very flexible and a rearrangement of its correct conformation could induce the collapse of the oxyanion hole gly143-ser144-cys145 in the s1 subsite therefore inactivate the protease completely 14 the ser139ala mutant showed only a minor difference in the monomerdimer equilibrium with the wild type protease table 3 implying that the contribution of residue ser139 to dimerization is not dominant while the ser139ala mutant preserved only 50 of the wild type activity table 4 which indicates that mutation of ser139 might directly affect the catalysis most probably by altering the conformation of the oxyanion loop although phe140 donated hydrogen bonds to ser1 through its main-chain groups the phe140ala mutant still had an obvious trend to the monomer state table 3 it is possible that the hydrophobic packing between the side-chain phenyl of phe140 and the residues nearby eg his163 his172 would also stabilize the phe140ser1 interactions fig 2a meanwhile mutation of phe140 completely abolished the proteolytic activity of sars-cov 3clpro table 4 further suggesting that the interactions mediated by phe140 might also contribute well to maintain the conformational stability of the s1 subsite 14 in summary our study characterized the contributions of several previously unidentified residues to the dimer stability and catalytic activity of sars-cov 3clpro since the dimeric structure has been proved to be indispensable for enzymatic activity of sars-cov 3clpro it is easy to understand the conclusion of no dimer no activity in this study some residues have been revealed to be important for both dimerization and activity meanwhile sars-cov 3clpro is a very flexible protein and the correct conformation state might also be vital for the protease to maintain its full activity thus in addition to dimer dissociation an altered conformation of the substrate-binding pocket possibly induced by single mutation on the dimer interface could also make the protease inactive our future study should be focused on determining the crystal structures of these mutated proteases which will shed more light on understanding the dimerization-activity relationship of sars-cov 3clpro  comprehensive insights into the catalytic mechanism of middle east

respectively36 all
three syndromes are caused by coronaviruses belonging to the same
beta-coronavirus family 3c-like protease 3clpro is a cysteine
protease critical to the life cycles of all three types of coronaviruses
thus it is an attractive target for drug design especially for designing
pan-coronavirus antivirals79 we are interested in examining the mechanistic
details of 3clpro with the hope of aiding in drug design
efforts specifically the mers coronavirus mers-cov possesses a single-stranded
positive-sense rna genome with 2 open reading frames orfs and encodes two
polyprotein precursors1013
which are cleaved by 3clpro and a papain-like cysteine protease
plpro to generate 16 nonstructural proteins

is critical for most of the cleavage events during polyprotein
processing1819 the catalytic mechanism of mers-cov
3clpro is largely unknown for sars-cov 3clpro
a gln in the substrate p1 position and a small amino acid residue such as
gly ser or ala in the p1 position are proposed to be essential
based on an analysis of the active sites sequence2023 in addition a
cyshis catalytic dyad is reported to complete the
proteolytic task through a common nucleophilic-type reaction in sars-cov
3clpro figure 12425 although the substrate specificity
and nucleophilic-attack model of the sars-cov 3clpro dyad have
been illustrated the detailed catalytic mechanism of coronavirus
3clpro is still unclear this inspires us to work on
deciphering the comprehensive mechanism of coronavirus
3clpro here we report the comprehensive molecular catalytic mechanism binding and
catalysis of mers-cov 3clpro and sars-cov 3clpro for
substrate binding the protease adopted a residue pair glu-his and a
stable hydrogen bond formed by a conserved his and the substrate gln to
recognize the conserved gln in the p1 position of the substrate for
catalysis a conserved gscgs motif was identified and shown to stabilize the
active site of the substrate and maintain the mobility of the catalytic
cysteine side chain in addition a partial negative charge cluster pncc
formed by arg-tyr-asp was proven to be essential for catalysis via a remote
interaction mediated by a conserved water molecule the distinctions between
proteases from sars and mers were explored in terms of their catalytic
efficiency furthermore mutation studies were conducted to improve the
enzymatic activity 8-fold the inhibitor of mers-cov 3clpro was
optimized to improve the potency via introduction of a powerful hydrogen
bond interaction between the inhibitor and the critical q195 of mers-cov

module in discovery studio software package using the qm-calculated
transition state information water molecules were assigned with the
tip3p model and the ff14sb force field was applied for the classical
molecular dynamics simulation the complexes were placed in a
truncated octahedral box of water molecules extending 100 
along each dimension a certain number of counterions na
were added to neutralize the calculated system the md systems were
first minimized by the steepest descent minimization of 1000 steps
followed the conjugate gradient minimization of 9000 steps heated up
from 0 to 300 k at constant volume in 50 ps and equilibrated for
another 50 ps without any restraints in the md simulations the
particle mesh ewald pme method was employed for long-range
electrostatic interactions finally multiple 10 ns of trajectories
100 000 frames were collected for the further prs analysis
similar to our previous studies4244 for each reaction system a snapshot that was close to the average
simulated structure was extracted from the stable md trajectory as the
starting structure for the ab initio calculations specifically we
tracked the distance between the sulfur atom of c148 and the carbonyl
carbon atom of substrate active site in the attacking state which
conformed burgidunitz criteria of near-attach-conformation
parameters the s---c distance 35  and attacking angle
alpha 100110 and scoca dihedral 8595
ie distance d1 in scheme s3 within stable md trajectories we
obtained an average d1 value and chose the snapshot with the d1 value
being close to the corresponding average d1 value each system was
truncated as a model scheme s3 to mimic the reaction pathway in the
protein environment during the geometry optimization the boundary
atoms were fixed at the position they were in in the protein
environment this ensured that each reaction moiety stayed in the same
orientation as that in the protein environment geometry optimization
was conducted using the b3lyp functional and a uniform 6-31g basis
set4547 frequency analysis was used to calculate the
gibbs free energies at 29815 k and 1 atm single-point energy
calculation was carried out on the optimized geometry with the mp2
method and the 6-31g basis set the smd solvation method with a
dielectric constant of   56968 chlorobenzene was used to
model the weak polarization effect of the protein environment the ab
initio calculation was carried out using the gaussian 09
program48 with the aim of understanding the molecular catalytic pattern of mers-cov
3clpro and sars-cov 3clpro it is
important to examine the experimentally determined structure of the
protease with a bound ligand for mers-cov 3clpro we
started with a reported complex structure pdb code 4rsp for further
investigation to check the catalytic mechanism and unravel the
general coronavirus 3clpro catalytic mechanism we sought
to determine the complex structure of sars-cov 3clpro with
a peptidomimetic aldehyde inhibitor pdb code 6lnq for detailed
information see table 1
generally mers-cov 3clpro and sars-cov 3clpro
appear as a quasi-ellipsoid and possess three separate portions
domain i domain ii and domain iii which are connected by flexible
loops figure 2a more
narrowly the structures of the two proteases chiefly comprise 10
helices 110 and 13 -sheets
113 figure s2 therein domains i and ii are reported
to execute catalytic activity while domain iii is responsible for
protease dimerization49 by superimposing the two
structures the root-mean-square deviation rmsd value indicated that
the catalytic zone domain i and domain ii presented higher
similarity than the dimerization domain domain iii figure 2a in addition similar
results emerged among four other coronavirus 3clpro
proteins human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 bat coronavirus hku4
bcov-hku4 human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 and human coronavirus
229e hcov-229e which hinted that various coronaviruses
3clpro have a conserved proteolysis mechanism
figure s3 for establishment of the enzymatic assay the active sites of the
polypeptide precursors were presented via bioinformatics analysis and
a fret-based dodecapeptide as an experimental substrate was
constructed following analysis of these active sites figures 2b and s4 for validating the availability of the
substrate mers-cov 3clpro and sars-cov 3clpro
were tested and the kinetic dynamic parameters of the proteases were
determined figures 2c and
s5 identification of the catalytic center is essential to provide a
foundation for decoding the catalytic mechanism in mers-cov
3clpro two cysteines c145 and c148 are located in
the catalytic center figure 2d whereas sars-cov 3clpro exploits only
c145 to execute catalysis nevertheless c148 has been reported to be
essential to the protease although the significance of c145 in
mers-cov 3clpro is still unknown to examine the influence
of c145 in mers-cov 3clpro we mutated both cys to ser and
ala enzymatic assays using the purified variants c145s and c145a
showed that these mutations manifested comparable efficiency to wt
mers-cov 3clpro while the variants c148s and c148a almost
eliminated the catalytic efficiency figure 2d meanwhile the mutants h41a and
h41l were also incapable of cutting the substrate which suggested the
catalytic dyad h41c148 in mers-cov 3clpro for substrate binding the highly conserved native substrate p1 site
residue attracted our attention figure s4 we previously developed inhibitors of
ev71 3c protease ev71 3cpro and determined the complex
structure of ev71 3cpro with a peptidomimetic inhibitor
pdb code 5bpe5053 by comparing the s1 pocket
structures of ev71 3cpro and coronavirus 3clpro
we noticed an extra hydrogen bond interaction between the conserved
protease glutamine e169 of mers-cov 3clpro and e166 of
sars-cov 3clpro and the lactam ring of the inhibitor
which presumably led to the enhanced inhibitor affinity figure 3a therefore to
verify this assumption mutagenesis of mers-cov 3clpro e169
was performed in principle we began mutagenesis via replacement of e169 with asp that
also contains a carboxyl group with negative charge following
evaluation compared with the wt protease the mutant e169d exhibited
inferior catalytic efficiency which suggested that the electrostatic
force of e169 was too laborious to affect the substrate binding
process figure 3b
subsequently enzymatic assays were conducted using purified variants
with five neutral amino acid residues ala gln leu met and val
instead of glu figure 3b
comparable enzymatic activity was observed for the e169l and e169q
mutants which possessed side chains of similar bulk to glu while the
e169a e169 v and e169 m mutants which had side chains with various
volumes at the 169th site showed decreased catalytic
activity compared with wt protease which indicated that steric
effects at e169 were required to fit the substrate figure 3b however the flexible
side-chain of e169 meant that this amino acid alone could not achieve
this effect when scanning the structure conserved residue h175 was conventionally
ignored owing to its weak interaction with the inhibitor however the
inextricable interaction between h175 and e169 made it reasonable to
speculate that h175 was indispensable for proteolytic bioactivity
figure 3c
subsequently crippling the impregnable interactions by replacing h175
with ala leu glu and even asn could remarkably reduce the enzymatic
activity though the mutation of h175 to gln which shared a similar
hydrogen bond donor feature to his could retain the protease
bioactivity figure 3d the
results indicated that the hydrogen bond interaction between h175 and
e169 was essential to the protease which was in contrast to the
previous e169l mutant result figure 3b then a multipoint mutant e169lh175l was
created and this mutant expressed inferior catalytic activity figure 3d to explain these
unexpected results molecular dynamic md simulations were applied to
imitate the binding mode of the protease with the natural substrate
which was construed form the peptidomimetic aldehyde structure and
optimized by md simulation as consequence compared with wt the
distance between residues 169 and 175 was remarkably enlarged in the
mutant h175l and mutant e169lh175l while the mutant e169l displayed
the same distance as the wt protease figure s6 which hinted that redundant space may
strikingly affect protease catalytic activity in the h175l and mutant
e169lh175l following povme script calculation the results
demonstrated that the redundant space interfered with the fit between
the protease and substrate which indicated that e169 mainly
interacted with the substrate through steric effects rather than
electrostatic interactions figure 3e due to the essential fitting model of e169-h175 it led us to question
whether a residue with a suitable side chain volume might act similar
role with gln to fill the s1 pocket and start the cleavage event
however coronavirus 3clpro preferred gln to his which
exhibits a similar side chain volume as gln in the substrate p1 site
invalidating this assumption to explore the underlying reason the
structures of the two proteases were scrutinized and a conserved
histidine h166 in mers-cov 3clpro and h164 in sars-cov
3clpro caught our attention as it formed robust
hydrogen bond interactions with the inhibitor figure
4a in an effort to validate the
effect of the robust hydrogen mutagenesis study on h166 of mers-cov
3clpro was performed mutants h166a and h166l could
reduce the proteolytic activity which clearly demonstrated the
significance of the intense hydrogen bond figure
4b as gln and asn have similar
hydrogen bond donor and acceptor abilities as his both of them were
suitable replacements for histidine but mutants h166n and h166q had
significantly decreased activity implying that other characteristics
might define the conserved histidine figure 4b after examining the structures due
to the inappropriate dihedral cd2-cg-cb-h presented by h166
conserved h166 exhibited an eclipsed conformation leading to the
torsional tension and a rotating trend figure 4c thus there were restrictive
ingredients that limited the rotation of the h166 side chain and
maintained h166 in its energized conformation which made h166
interact with the substrate gln in an appropriate angle and
distance by scrutinizing the two structures conserved y164 was detected as
exploiting its phenolic hydroxyl group to interact with h166 figure 4a in theory the
acidic phenolic hydroxyl group of y164 can provide a proton or form a
stronger hydrogen bond with h166 to explore the significance and
acting mode of y164 we chose mutants y164a y164f y164r y164 k
y164e and y164d considering electrical and steric factors compared
with wt all of the variants showed depressing catalytic activity
this result suggested that the phenolic hydroxyl group of y164
interacted with h166 via the hydrogen bond to restrain h166 in a
suitable orientation to promote preferable substrate recognition
figure 4d to
understand the role of y164 md simulations were performed and the
results showed that replacement of y164 led to the free rotation of
h166 and leaving of the substrate gln from the s1 pocket figures 4e and s7 meanwhile f143 is located near h166 and appears to interact with h166
via  stacking interactions to hamper the
rotation of h166 figure 4a
nevertheless two variants containing an aromatic ring f143y and
f143w exhibited significantly reduced activities indicating that the
 stacking may be not the major factor in the
case of variants f143l f143m f143 v and f143a f143l unexpectedly
displayed excellent performance equal to wt figure
4d compared with that of wt and
f143l mutant md simulation results of the mutant f143a revealed a
deficiency in steric restriction leading to an unstable connection
between h166 and y164 and the substrate glutamine figures 4e s8 and s9 therefore f143 was proven to employ
steric effects to restrain the rotation of h166 similar results
involving the s1 pocket were exhibited in sars-cov 3clpro
during the substrate binding stage figure s10 with regard to the catalysis it was inevitable to explore the sequence
nearby the active cys on the basis of the alignment of the common
coronavirus 3clpro sequence a conserved gscgs sequence
caught our attention figure 5a as a familiar protein linker the gs sequence was
frequently applied for protein engineering however the gs sequence
especially a double gs sequence infrequently emerges near the viral
cysteine protease catalytic center therefore to verify the
significance of the motif the residues in the gscgs motif of mers-cov
3clpro were sequentially replaced with ala and all of
the mutants represented reduced activities which manifested that the
gscgs motif was essential for protease activity figures 5b and s11 further exploring the structure of the
protease the gscgs motif exhibited three consecutive turns via
obvious hydrogen bonding figure 6a as pro is an appropriate residue to form a turn in
the protein structure the mutation of gly to pro was performed the
decreased bioactivity of variants g146p and g149p indicated the
irreplaceability of the gscgs motif and the significant role of gly in
the gscgs motif figure 5b for investigating the effect of g146 in the motif md simulations were
performed and the results suggested that g146 and c148 could form
firm hydrogen bonds with the substrate active site in the wt protease
conformation figure 5c
however the conformation of the g146a and g146p mutants following md
simulation demonstrated that the 146th residue failed to
have an optimal distance or interactive angle and even a deficiency
in hydrogen bonding interaction to bind the substrate active site
figures 5d s12 and s13 as a consequence compared with wt
protease a modest swing of the substrate gln residue emerged in the
g146a and g146p mutants this result indicated that g146 could fix the
carbonyl group at the substrate active site decrease the swing at the
active site and facilitate the assault of c148 figure 5e with analysis on the md simulation results of variants g149a and g149p
the dihedral constituted from sg-cb-ca-c of c148 presented extreme
stability compared with the wt protease which suggested that the
rotation frequency of the c148 side chain had been remarkably
decreased figure 5f in
parallel the pmf calculation result for wt protease manifested two
low energy conformations appearing in the trajectory of the protease
however the results of variants g149a and g149p suggested that only
one low energy conformation where the thiol was far from the active
site of the substrate emerged in the motion of the protease
figure s14 and manifested the rotation of c148 side
chain relied on g149 to unveil the underlying reason the rotation of
the c148 thiol in the wt protease was further investigated and two
typical states resting state and attacking state were noticed in the
md simulations figure s15 in the resting state the c148 thiol
preferred to deviate from the substrate and interact with h166
conversely the c148 thiol presented a suitable conformation close to
the substrate in the attacking state by superimposing the attacking
and resting state conformations the c148-g149 main chain exhibited
obvious deflection while the dihedral  and  angles of
c148 were stable figures s16 and s17 this result indicated that the
translation of the c148-g149 main chain other than rotation might
contribute to the rotation of the c148 thiol in the g149a mutant the
smaller a149  dihedral led to a compact conformation of a149
and enhanced the rigid hydrogen bond between a149 and h166 which
indicated that the translation of the c148-a149 main chain would
demand more energy to break the restriction of h166 to a149 in the
g149a mutant figure 5d and
5g additionally due to the deficiency of the
hydrogen bond interaction in g149p the c148 thiol formed a more
robust interaction with h166 in compensation interfering with the
rotation of the c148 thiol figure s18 to smoothly execute the task discussed above the gscgs motif must
maintain three special and consecutive turns turns i and iii are
guaranteed via two interior hydrogen bonds of the motif mediated by
s147 and s150 figure 6a
mutagenesis of ser to ala would seriously enlarge the distance g146
carbonyl at the active site and c148 carbonyl at the active site and
hamper the anchoring effect of g146 and c148 toward the active site in
the md simulation figure 6b interestingly considering that turn iii is dominated by
a hydrogen bond between s150 and s147 the substation of s150 with ala
would interfere not only with turn iii but also turn i this result
explained the more drastic effect of variant s150a than that of s147a
on the distance alternatively turn ii is maintained by an exterior hydrogen bond formed
by n28 figure 6c
mutagenesis of n28 to ala leu asp and gln as well as his resulted
in the reduced activities of the protease figure
6d to investigate the concrete
effect of n28 md simulations were performed on the mutant n28l as a
consequence similar to that in the mutant g149a the free rotation of
the c148 thiol was restricted in mutant n28l which further proved
that the mutagenesis of n28 would deprive the pulling force of n28 to
the carbonyl group of c148 and lead to more robust hydrogen bond
interaction between the main chain of c148-g149 and h166 hence
dominated by n28 the formation of turn ii contributed to the rotation
of the c148 thiol figure 6e
and 6f with the development of the catalysis bearing an analogous
chymotrypsin-like structure of 3clpro the ev71 3c protease
cuts the polyprotein precursors with its catalytic triad glu his
and cys figure s19 nevertheless there is a catalytic dyad
his and cys in coronavirus 3clpro due to the glu
deficiency after aligning the six coronavirus 3clpro
sequences figure s20 the conserved acidic amino acid d190
caught our attention interestingly d190 is located almost 67 
away from h41 which seemed problematic for promoting firm interaction
between d190 and the catalytic dyad due to the long distance figure 7a to discover the
significance of d190 d190 was mutated to leu ala his and asn as a
result the d190a d190l d190h and d190n mutants failed to
effectively cleave the substrate while the d190e mutant retained
protease catalytic activity which implied that the acidic residue was
indispensable despite the far distance from the catalytic dyad figure 7b in addition to d190 r40 formed a strong electric interaction with d190
in the coronavirus 3clpro which might neutralize the
negative charge of d190 figure 7a following mutagenesis of r40 the catalytic
activity of mutants exhibited a remarkable decline figure 7b interestingly when r40 was
mutated to an aliphatic residue leu or ala the density of the d190
negative charge would be enhanced and the proteolytic activity might
in theory be improved however the mutants r40l and r40a manifested
decreased proteolytic activity therefore a partial negative charge
cluster constituted from r40-d190 was supposed to play a significant
role in the catalysis activity meanwhile the value of the positive
charge of the arg side chain was usually superior to the value of the
negative charge manifested by asp side chain in physical condition
this implied the existence of an extra residue that could alleviate
the positive charge of r40 for maintaining the partial negative charge
of r40-d190 investigation of the structures of the two proteases
showed that y54 and m85 were located near r40 and might interact with
r40 via a -cation interaction and an electron
atmospherecation interaction respectively figure 7c following mutagenesis of
y54 and m85 the results suggested that y54 rather than m85 could
interact with r40 via the cation interaction which
potentially supported that y54 could interact with r40 via the
-cation interaction to alleviate the electrical interference of
r40 to d190 and further caused d190 to present partial negative charge
figure 7d
additionally multipoint mutations were introduced and the loss of
catalytic activities of the variants reiterated the importance of the
partial negative charge cluster pncc constituted by d190-r40-y54
figure 7d since the d190-r40-y54 synergistically took effect on the catalysis the
interior close connection of pncc required a special structure for
support investigation of the protease sequence near r40 identified a
remarkably conserved sequence containing c38 and p39 figure s21 there was a typical -turn formed
by p39v42 hydrogen bond interactions which led to r40
protruding from the loop and potentially enhanced the interior
interaction of pncc figure 7e however the deficiency of apparent interaction involving
c38 suggested that the c38 side chain volume might be responsible for
shaping the remarkably conserved short loop to confirm this
hypothesis we mutated c38 and p39 and the results verified the
assumption figure 7f from the perspective of d190 an atypical turn was formed and conserved
residue q195 interacted with the main chain carbonyl group of m189 and
k191 which caused a protrusion of d190 from the loop and promoted the
r40-d190 interaction figures s21 and 7e the decreased
catalytic activities of the mutagenesis proved the significance of
q195 figure 7f owing to the deficiency of intuitive binding remote interactions are
generally neglected in coronavirus 3clpro the location of
pncc is approximately 67  from the catalytic dyad which
makes it difficult to assume powerful interactions between the dyad
and pncc however the investigation of the structures of the two
proteases identified a conserved water which might mediate the remote
interaction between these two essential components figure 8a to verify the necessity of
the conserved water md simulations were employed to imitate the
motion of the conserved water that was extracted from its original
location in mers-cov 3clpro following pmf calculation the
lower system energy demand compelled the water to penetrate into the
protein and locate itself at a suitable site which proved the
essentiality of conserved water figure 8b meanwhile the conserved water was noticed to interact with a key residue
q167 in mers-cov 3clpro and h164 in sars-cov
3clpro which was considered to hold the conserved
water in an appropriate location figure 8a thus the q167 in mers-cov
3clpro was mutated to aliphatic residues figure 8c as a consequence
biochemical results and povme calculation results suggested that the
volume and hydrophilicity of the pocket created by h41 q167 m168
and d190 were critical to the catalytic activity of protease figure 8d with further
investigation the lower catalytic activity emerged in the variants
q167s q167n and q167h with hydrophilic side chains at
167th residue which additionally proved that the
long hydrophilic side chain of q167 anchored the conserved water in
the suitable location these results verified the significance of the
conserved water furthermore the mutation of q167 to glu with an
additional negative center would decrease the enzymatic activity and
further verified the importance of the partial negative charge of pncc
figure 8c a highly
similar result was observed for sars-cov 3clpro figure s22 as discussed above to further explore the concrete effects of the remote
interaction composed of pncc and the conserved water prereaction
state prs analysis and quantitative calculations were performed
according to the previous qmmm calculation3940 the
first step of mers-cov 3clpro-catalyzed reaction was
believed to be the nucleophilic attack of the cysteine residue and
the resulting thioester would be rapidly hydrolyzed by a water
molecule under the general base catalysis of his41 figure 8e showed the accessibility of
the gln-ser peptide bond of the substrate to the cys148 thiolate of
the mers-cov 3clpro it is highly essential for the
nucleophilic thiolate and the acceptor carbonyl group to align up in
the sp2-sp3 conversion to maximize the orbital interaction between the
peptide  lumo and sulfur lone pair homo in the
nucleophilic addition54 using the
burgidunitz criteria of near-attach-conformation parameters
the s---c distance 35  and attacking angle alpha
100110 and scoca dihedral 8595 the
calculated prs indicated a significant population belong to the
resting state where the sc distance is as long as 48
 it is likely that the 3clpro is yet poorly
evolutionary for this substrate therefore we chose an attacking
state conformation on the basis of the criteria described at methods
and performed ab initio calculation compared with the state excluding
the remote interaction the integral state presented a lower catalytic
energy barrier which suggested that the existence of the remote
interaction could extremely accelerate the first step of the
nucleophilic reaction figure 8e taken together with the partial negative charge of
pncc it was considered to temporarily stabilize the protonated
histidine with conserved water mediating rather than fastening the
protonated h41 therefore interfering with the subsequent catalytic
process according to the investigations described above the comprehensive
catalytic mechanism of coronavirus 3clpro was proposed
insights into the catalytic mechanism would contribute to penetrate
into the individuality of coronavirus 3clpro and decipher
the distinction of the catalytic efficiency between mers-cov
3clpro and sars-cov 3clpro when designing inhibitors against 3clpro cyclization of the
glutamine side-chain to a s--lactam and s--lactam
was an efficient application of the configuration restriction
strategy therefore peptidomimetic aldehydes 8a and
8b were synthesized and their inhibitory
activities were evaluated figures 9a and 9b compound 8a
showed more preferable inhibitory activities than 8b
against the two proteases we determined two cocrystal structures of
each compound bound to sars-cov 3clpro pdb code 6lny 6lo0 see the
detailed information referred to in table 2 analysis of the two structures
detected a slight deflection of e166 which demonstrated the obvious
extrusion force existed between the lactam ring and a rigid
-sheet segment consisting of g170 v171 and h172 and
resulted in the enhancement of the fitting interaction between the
protease and 8a figure 9c interestingly a similar section presented a turn
dominated by the hydrogen bond n172-t174 and a loose flexible loop
in mers-cov 3clpro figure 9d in addition sars-cov 3clpro displayed more efficient
substrate affinity than mers-cov 3clpro lower
km value figure
2c therefore we hypothesized
that the presence of the turn might transform the secondary structure
of the segment and cause the catalytic distinction of the two
proteases the mutant t174 v mutation could increase catalytic
activity which suggested that t174 might dominate the secondary
structure of the segment and lead to the significant catalytic
distinction of mers-cov 3clpro and sars-cov
3clpro figures 9e and 9f in the catalysis h164 of sars-cov 3clpro was noticed to
replace the corresponding q167 in mers-cov 3clpro however
the q167h variant in mers-cov 3clpro exhibited inferior
enzymatic activity figure 10a it was first considered that the amino acid
residues surrounding the q167 for mers-cov 3clpro and h164
for sars-cov 3clpro might determine the selectivity and
further interfere with protease activity in mers-cov
3clpro the s178 side chain acted as a hydrogen bond
acceptor to fix q167 while t88 might be responsible for maintaining
the suitable space volume among t88 q167 and s178 figure 10b with the change of q167 in
mers-cov 3clpro to h164 in sars-cov 3clpro the
t175 side chain acted as a hydrogen bond acceptor to fix h164 in
addition t175 and c85 were responsible to maintain the appropriate
space volume among c85 h164 and t175 figure 10b to verify the analysis on the environment of the residues for anchoring
the conserved water mutations of t88 and s178 in mers-cov
3clpro were performed the enzymatic results showed
that the single point mutation resulted in decreased protease
activities but the multipoint mutation s178tt88c almost remained in
the catalytic activity figure 10c meanwhile the md simulations results indicated the
violent swing of q167 emerged in mutants s178a and t88a while stable
q167 appeared in mutant s178tt88c figures s23 and s24 these results verified the
similar environment of mers-cov 3clpro q167 and sars-cov
3clpro h164 and suggested that the key residue to
anchor the conserved water rather than the environment might be the
main ingredient to cause the distinction of two proteases therefore
on the basis of the elimination of environmental impacts a multipoint
mutant t88cq167hs178t of mers-cov 3clpro was created
compared with wt mers-cov 3clpro the decreased proteolytic
ability and remarkably decreased kcat
value of the multipoint mutation t88cq167hs178t indicated that the
residue anchoring the conserved water allowed for the distinction
between the catalytic capabilities of the two proteases in the
cleavage stage figure 10d the high specificity of 3clpro prompts us to improve the
catalytic efficiency for engineering enzyme like tobacco etch virus
protease tev-p in intracellular regulation and trypsin in protein
sequence analysis5556 in addition the significance
of 3clpro prompts us to develop effective antiviral agents
therefore the profound investigation of the catalytic mechanism
contributes to enzyme design for expanding enzyme applications and
antiviral drug design for the mers-cov 3clpro as a result of the conserved water
being located at the zone enveloped by h41 q167 m168 and d190 to
mediate the remote interaction restricting the motion of conserved
water might be helpful to maintain the remote interaction between the
dyad and pncc moreover in the md simulations on the catalytic
process h41 formed protonated histidine-hip and c148 became thiolate
following an abstract proton processing of h41 a typical
conformation of the conserved water approaching m168 was captured
figure 11a
therefore mutagenesis of m168 to hydrophobic leu was investigated to
impede the conserved water from approaching l168 and maintain the
tight interaction between pncc and protonated histidine the enhanced
enzymatic activity proved the validity of the mutagenesis strategy
and the underlying mechanism was shown to restrict the motion of the
conserved water in compact area via md simulation which further
proved the temporary stabilizing effect of pncc via the conserved
water figures 11b 11c and s25 a highly similar mechanism was also proven for
sars-cov 3clpro figure s26 in combination with the previous study on the distinction of two protease
in recognition stage multipoint mutagenesis was performed the
enzymatic results suggested the multipoint mutation m168lt174 v of
mers-cov 3clpro exhibited an 8-fold increase in catalytic
efficiency compared to wt protease on the basis of the prs analysis
it was computationally observed that the cys148 sg atom in the
highest-efficient mutant m168lt174 v points to the carbonyl c atom
statistically and dynamically better than those in the wt protease on
the basis of the burgidunitz criteria of
near-attach-conformation parameters the calculated prs ratio was
about 118 between the wt and mutant which was conclusive that the
distal mutations at the 168th and 174th sites
can promote the reactive population of prs via synergetic effect
meanwhile the prs analysis on the multiple mutant m168lt174 v
reiterate the validity of molecular mechanism investigation figure 8e insights into the catalytic mechanism are meaningful to guide inhibitor
design according to the explicit investigation essential q195 was
located at the surface of the substrate binding pocket and presented
extreme stability in the md simulations this implied that q195 could
become a significant target to optimize inhibitors figure 11d in a previous
investigation 12a was designed to inhibit mers-cov
3clpro and expressed a specific inhibitory activity
in the study focused on the binding model of 12a md
simulation results showed that the p4 site of 12a
approached the q195 therefore a pyridine group as a hydrogen
acceptor was introduced into the inhibitor at p4 to generate
12b which might smoothly interact with q195 the
results of enzymatic analysis and md simulations revealed that
12b exhibited an almost 4-fold increase in
inhibitory activity against mers-cov 3clpro compared to
12a and formed a tight interaction with q195 figures 11e 11f and s27 by exploring mers-cov 3clpro and sars-cov 3clpro the
experimental results clearly present a comprehensive molecular catalytic
mechanism for both mers-cov 3clpro and sars-cov
3clpro taking mers-cov 3clpro as an example for
substrate binding e169-h175 identifies the substrate gln via steric effect
rather than through direct electrostatic interaction of e169 meanwhile the
protease utilizes a hydrogen bond formed by y164 and the steric effect of
f143 to stabilize h166 in an eclipsed conformation which is advantageous for
h166 to establish the powerful hydrogen bond interaction with the gln of
substrate and enhance the recognition of the substrate gln by the protease
figure 12a throughout the
investigation the conserved carbonyl group rather than the side chain
n-terminal amide bond in the gln is considered essential for recognition of
3clpro this implies that replacement of the gln side chain
n-terminal amide bond with a suitable volume group which should be fit for
the conserved residue pair e169-h175 this strategy may extend the variety
of the p1 fragment of 3clpro inhibitor during the catalysis a conserved gscgs motif is identified to form consecutive
three turns and plays a crucial role for 3clpro in detail
guaranteed by s147 and s150 turn i and turn iii fix the substrate active
site in an appropriate location and abate the vibrating frequency of active
site which contribute to the attack of active c148 additionally
maintained by an external hydrogen bond interaction between the motif and
n28 stable turn ii and g149 are conducive to the free rotation of c148 side
chain such that the c148 thiol approached the substrate active site figure 12b alternatively
mediated by the conserved water a remote interaction between dyad and pncc
r40-y54-d190 is confirmed to smoothly accelerate the catalysis as the
pncc can temporarily stabilize the protonated h41 figure
12c since the pncc is located at the
surface of the opposite side of the active center it may be a fascinating
allosteric site to design 3clpro inhibitors via interfering with
the partial charge of the pncc figure 12d to ensure the accuracy of the comprehensive catalytic mechanism we determined
an analog catalytic mechanism is checked with sars-cov 3clpro
importantly the critical residues are highly conserved among diverse
coronaviruses the mechanisms reported here may be common among coronavirus
3clpro and contribute to provide the foundation for the
further investigation of sars-cov-2 3clpro figure s20 more significantly in view of the fact that
coronavirus is effortless to evolve investigation on the general catalytic
mechanism of coronavirus 3clpro is meaningful to face further
virus variation according to the catalytic mechanism the distinctions of two protease on the
catalytic characteristics are explicitly investigated in brief the
essential secondary structure dominated by t174 of mers-cov
3clpro is confirmed to be responsible for the inferior
substrate affinity of mers-cov 3clpro than sars-cov
3clpro in catalysis the more stably conserved water
anchored by q167 causes more tight remote interaction and leads to the more
efficient excision on the substrate in mers-cov 3clpro moreover
the insight into the catalytic mechanism of mers-cov 3clpro and
sars-cov 3clpro can effectively guide mutation studies to improve
the catalytic potency of the protease it also meaningfully directs the
establishment of powerful hydrogen bond interaction between inhibitor and
significant q195 of mers-cov 3clpro to improve the inhibitory
activity in summary the cumulative experimental results clearly reveal the
comprehensive molecular catalytic mechanism of mers-cov 3clpro
and sars-cov 3clpro on the basis of the comprehensive mechanism
the distinction of two proteases on the catalytic efficiency is investigated
and effective applications are energetically explored the results presented
should provide a solid foundation for understanding the enzymatic mechanism
and help efforts in rational de novo protein design and antiviral drug
design  the impact of super-spreaders in covid-19 mapping genome variation worldwide alberto gmez-carballa xabier bello jacobo pardo-seco federico martinn-torres antonio salas  the human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is responsible for the major pandemic of the 21 st century we analyzed 4700 sars-cov-2 genomes and associated meta-data retrieved from public repositories sars-cov-2 sequences have a high sequence identity 999 which drops to 96 when compared to bat coronavirus we built a mutationannotated reference sars-cov-2 phylogeny with two main macrohaplogroups a and b both of asian origin and 160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide revealing a uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could complicate the design of future vaccines the root of sars-cov-2 genomes locates at the chinese haplogroup b1 with a tmrca dating to 12 november 2019 -thus matching epidemiological records sub-haplogroup a2a originates in china and represents the major non-asian outbreak multiple founder effect episodes most likely associated with super-spreader hosts explain covid-19 pandemic to a large extent  the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first detected in late 2019 in patients from the city of wuhan hubei province china suffering from respiratory illnesses and leading to a disease that has been popularized as coronavirus disease or covid-19 the disease was declared an international public health emergency on 30 january 2020 and a few weeks later on 11 march 2020 it was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who 2020 even though it has not been possible to trace an index case there is a large amount of epidemiological information that has been very useful for tracking the pandemic spread of sars-cov-2 the first report of covid-19 took place on 1 december 2019 in a patient from wuhan most likely linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market of the city in the present study we built a solid phylogenetic skeleton of sars-cov-2 genomes that allows to investigate sequence variation in a large number of genomes 4700 supplementary material deposited in gisaid explore site-specific mutational instability investigate phylogeographic patterns of variation worldwide and clarify the role of super-spreader hosts in the pandemic identity of sars-cov-2 to other closely related species human sars-cov-2 genomes have a within sequence identity of 9998   an inter-specific maximum likelihood ml tree was built using pangolin sars and bat coronavirus genomes as outgroups to investigate their phylogenetic relationships with sars-cov-2 supplementary material the tree depicts the sars coronavirus genome occupying the most external branch next all the pangolin genomes cluster separately from bat and human coronavirus which also group separately in line with its very low identity with sars-cov-2 bat-412976 behaves as an outlier in the tree overall the clustering pattern in the tree is in very good agreement with sequence identity values  table 1  we next focused our attention on the root for all existing sars-cov-2 genomes assuming the bat coronavirus as its closest coronavirus relative we figure s4  see also skeleton in figure 4a  shows that the two very stable transitions c8782t and t28144c 3 and 1 total occurrences in the phylogeny respectively separate sars-cov-2 variation into two main clades a and b both originating in china sub-haplogroups emerging from these main clades are mainly supported by single mutations most of them being very solid along the phylogeny table s1  and therefore granting the robustness of the different clades it is notable that the structure of the branches in the parsimonious tree fully agrees with the skeleton shown in the ml tree phylogeographic information allows reconstructing dynamics of subhaplogroups worldwide figure 2  the main clades emerged in asia mainly in china while some minor ones appeared outside asia next section supplementary material  it is remarkable that a few haplotypes are disproportionally represented in continental regions or in particular countries supplementary material figure   s10  appearing abruptly in a few days period this pattern is compatible with super-spreaders arriving to certain geographic locations and giving rise to severe founder effects  figure 3a  haplotypes h1 h2 h3 and h4 ids as in figure s9  h14 appears 9 times in spain 922 4091 common haplotypes are frequently shared between neighboring countries an observation mirroring the easy spread of the virus over short geographic distances for instance h33 n  9 of which 7 are in portugal and 2 in spain or h45 n  7 of which 4 are in portugal and 1 in spain table   s1 follow the same pattern networks of super-spreader candidates figure 3 show a star-like shape that is characteristic of super-spreader transmission and that clearly differentiates from patterns in the general tree that are more characteristic of homogeneous or chain of transmissions the most outstanding super-spreader event occurred in the washington state figure 3  this network involved about 328 genomes and its shape clearly suggests that a single super-spreader the peak is reached on 30 th january 2020 matching the asian lockdown consequently n e drops remarkably for the next couple of weeks but starts to grow progressively again from 12 th february 2020 coinciding with the beginning of the non-asian outbreak by overlapping covid-19 incidence officially reported cases per day worldwide httpsourworldindataorg with the ebps plot we observed comparable shape distributions but with a remarkable 14-15 days delay in reported cases per day worldwide with respect to the ebps distribution  figure   4b  we have undertaken a large-scale study on sars-cov-2 genomes considering a sample that is more than an order of magnitude higher than those of previous studies by focusing on high-quality hq genomes we devoted great effort to elucidate the most parsimonious phylogeny of sars-cov-2 this effort has allowed us to present novel phylogeographic inferences on the origin and dynamics of sars-cov-2 strains in particular we discovered a few dozen genomes representing  13 of the total database that played a fundamental role as super-spreaders of covid-19 disease these sars-cov-2 strains only two-three weeks after the initial cases reported and probably favored by super-spreaders eg genomes like the reference sequence played a special role in the beginning of the asiatic epidemic subsequently it followed an exponential growth that marked the beginning of the asian outbreak on the 20 th january 2020 and lasted until the end of this month next n e experienced a notable drop coinciding with human intervention and quarantine implemented in asia on 30 th january 2020 finally the beginning of a second wave of expansion outside asia starting around 12 th -27 th february 2020 is also wellrecorded on the sars-cov-2 genomes  figure 4c  the two-week delay between the dates suggested by the ebsp distribution and the official documented incidence of covid-19 in asia could be due to the mean incubation time of the disease but also to the number of cases officially declared being well below the real incidence with the data available in gisaid we were not able to detect association between main haplogroups and age and sex of carriers further research is needed to investigate the possible differential effect of strains haplogroups with the disease outcome none of the hq genomes investigated in our report carry this deletion in contrast to the weak or null action of positive selection on covid-19 spread there is strong evidence pointing to the role of genetic drift occurring in many continental regions and restricted locations especially outside china phylogeographic analysis allowed us to investigate pandemic dynamics worldwide the high incidence of a few lineages outside asia was more probably due to drift and not selective advantages the main non-asian subclade a2a was probably among the first ones to leave asia before this region established a severe population lockdown in good agreement with epidemiological data we observed multiple worldwide introductions of sars-cov-2 coming from asia super-spreaders were probably the main responsible for genetic drift episodes we detected 48 haplotypes in our dataset that most  we downloaded 4721 complete genomes from the gisaid database httpswwwepicovorgepi3frontend on 6 april 2020 3481 out of these 4721 sequences were noted as high quality hq  29kb high cover only based on the information provided by gisaid on 8 april 2020 unless otherwise indicated our analyses were carried out using the hq sars-cov-2 genomes see results although sars-cov-2 is an rna virus the data deposited in gisaid are in dna format metadata for these genomes was downloaded from the nextrain repository httpsgithubcomnextstrainncovtreemasterdata on 7 april 2020 this contains information on geographic location of the sample city country and continental region date of submission age gender etc this data allowed the marking of each genome by date when the virus was isolated location date and geographic origin among others we also downloaded coronavirus genomes from nine pangolins and bat genomes analyzed in the guangdong province gisaid ids omitting prefix epi-isl- 410544 410721 412860 410539 410539 410538 410543 410542 410541 410540 three bats 402131 412977 and 412976 and the reference sars genome genbank acc n nc0047183 in addition we downloaded genomes analyzed from a tiger gisaid 420293 and a dog gisaid 414518 presumably infected with sars-cov-2 by humans the sars-cov-2 genomes were aligned against the reference sequence used by eg nextstrain and many authors with genbank acc n mn9089473 submitted on 5 january 2020 gisaid id 402125 this was the first sars-cov-2 genome released on genbank alignment of sars-cov-2 genomes against the reference sequence was carried out using muscle v3831 program edgar 2004 apart from the discarded low-quality lq sequences and in order to ensure comparability between genomes we trimmed the 5 and 3 untranslated regions retaining a consensus sequence of 29607 bp that runs from position 169 to position 29776 we built a maximum likelihood ml tree in order to investigate interspecific phylogenetic relations between sars-cov-2 genomes and nine pangolins three bats and the reference sars genome genbank acc n nc0047183 interspecific alignment was carried out using mafft program katoh et al here we used different strategies to build the phylogeny of sars-cov-2 first a phylogeny based on ml was carried out to find the phylogenetic root of all sars-cov-2 using the most similar pangolin and bat coronavirus to the sars-cov-2 genome as ancestral relatives gisaid ids omitting prefix epi-isl- 410721 402131 respectively in the particular case of sars-cov-2 and taking into account epidemiological evidence we know for sure that its root is among the first genomes sequenced in china most likely in its hubei province therefore we used only genomes available until the end of february to build the ml tree in order to reduce the noise generated by an unnecessarily large number of genomes that were sequenced later and spread outside china second the most parsimonious strategy allows to determine main and secondary sub-clades of the sars-cov-2 tree identifying the characteristic mutations of clades this phylogenetic procedure also allows to count the occurrences of mutations along branches which serves as a good proxy for mutation-specific stability weissensteiner et al 2016 et al 2005  thus we took the following steps with regards to data filtering 1 we used only genomes labeled as high-coverage only and complete in gisaid 2 we collapsed the sequences to the common sequence segment ngs procedures generate artifacts at the 5 and 3 ends of the genome sequences which generally consist of deletions before eliminating the extremes of the sequences we checked in the complete genomes available if there were any variant that could be phylogenetically informative 3 a solid phylogeny should be based on stable mutational variants thus only branches supported by at least five genomes were considered 4 since many sub-haplogroups are supported by single mutations we only considered those having mutational stability we observed an excess of reversions at the tips of a few phylogenetic branches eg c14805t reversion in a few a1a sequences this phylogenetic noise could be due to the high mutational rate of the mutations involved recombination which is not unusual between coronaviruses rehman et al 2020 or sequencing errors for this reason we decided to not resolve these branches further while we await new evidence based on higher sequence quality genomes by simple counting of the mutational hits along the branches and at the tips of the phylogeny it is possible to infer the relative mutation stability of diagnostic sites the mutations at the tips of the phylogeny were counted only once within each terminal branch table s1 reports the number of occurrences in both the tree branches and in the tips of the phylogeny finally in order to guarantee the robustness of the phylogeny we checked that inferences on the root and phylogeny estimated from the ml tree 1 8 were in good agreement with the pattern of mutations observed in the most parsimonious tree according to colijn and gardi 2014 in particular we are interested in computing phylogenetic features of sars-cov-2 transmissions for our best candidates those haplotypes that have experienced a high frequency locally and in a short time period and compare them to those obtained using the remaining haplotypes from the same specific region we first built phylogenetic trees from sequence alignments using  sacking index it is the mean path length form tip to root slightly higher in super-spreader outbreaks and lower in chain out-breaks  staircase-ness defined as the portion of imbalance nodes norstrm et al 2012  it shows much lower values for chain out-breaks these values were computed for the main super-spreader candidates in specific geographic regions and also for the tree that includes the remaining haplotypes from the same region the comparison between values in both trees allows to compare different transmission patterns from the same culturalsocial context in addition we also carried out network analyses for a reported event of a super-spreader occurred in the diamond princess shipboard for which we could access to 25 sars-cov-2 genomes according to sekizuka et al 2020 the super-spreading event occurring in the shipboard may have originated from a single covid-19 patient who had disembarked in hong kong on 25 january 2020 to visualize the super-spreader phylogeny we built phylogenetic median joining networks using popart software leigh and bryant 2015  the average number of nucleotide differences per site between dna sequences or nucleotide diversity  nei and li 1979  sequencehaplotype diversity hd and tajima were collapsed into nearest points to represent local areas whenever possible in order to reach the minimum sampling required from the sequence alignments and annotated files we summarized information on mutational patterns in the sars-cov-2 genomes    evolution and variation of the sars-cov genome jianfei hu jing wang jing xu wei li yujun han yan li jia ji jia ye zhao xu zizhang zhang wei wei songgang li jun wang jian wang jun yu huanming yang   the sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus has been generally accepted as the major pathogen of sars which has cost thousands of lives globally a few months ago 1 2 this coronavirus has been classified as a new member of genus coronavirus in family coronaviridae and order nidovirales
3 serologically the seventeen species coronavirus have been classified into three groups groups i and ii contain mammalian viruses while group iii contains only avian viruses within each group the viruses are further subclassified into distinct species by the host range antigenic relationship and genomic organization genomic analyses have revealed that the sars-cov has typical features of coronavirus but it represents a novel virus that is phylogenetically distinct from any other member in the three known groups it has been suggested that the sars-cov is more closely related to the cow coronavirus and mhv murine hepatitis virus by comparing a conserved 215-aa amino acid segment of the polymerase protein 4 however the strength of the association is reduced if the entire genome is taken into consideration in this paper we present the phylogenetic comparison between sars-cov and other viruses and the analysis of the mutation sites of 42 sars-cov isolates as well as the possible recombination and horizontal transfer genome sizes of viruses range from a few hundred base pairs to a few hundred thousand base pairs figure 1 according to their genome sizes the 2498 virus isolates can be classified as three groups the first group also the smallest group corresponding to the low part of the figure represents the viroids the range of genome sizes of this group is between 120 bp avocado sunblotch viroid ncbi accession number af404074 and 374 bp citrus exocortis viroids ncbi accession number n30870 the range of the gc content is between 355 avocado sunblotch viroid genome size 248 bp ncbi accession number af404068 and 611 grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1 genome size 365 bp ncbi accession number af462165 here the two isolates of af404068 and af404074 demonstrate the sequence diversity of viroid genomes although they are only different isolates of avocado sunblotch viroid the difference of their genome sizes is still great the second group located at the top of the figure includes all double-strand viruses the range of genome sizes of this group is between 102653 bp lymphocystis disease virus 1 ncbi accession number l63545 and 335593 bp ectocarpus siliculosus virus ncbi accession number af204951 the range of the gc content of the genomes is between 1777 amsacta morei entomopoxvirus genome size 2322392 bp ncbi accession number af250284 and 724 bovine herpesvirus type 11 genome size 135301 bp ncbi accession number aj004801 the third group also the largest group corresponding to the middle part of the figure is the most complicated one that includes all other kinds of viruses the sars-cov belongs to this group from the figure it is easy to see that the gc content and genome size of the sars-cov are normal we performed a genomic sequence comparison between isolate bj01 of sars-cov and other viruses as a contrast we divided the viruses into coronaviruses and non-coronaviruses blastn default parameters was used to compare the sars-cov genomic sequence with the dataset of non-coronaviruses and sequences more than 20 nt in length and identity greater than 70 were extracted to create the conservative map figure 2 the coronaviruses are phylogenetically close to the sars-cov to demonstrate their respective similar regions to the sars-cov we mapped the comparison results to bj01 sequence to see the distribution as shown in figure 3 the sars-cov genomic fragments are plotted along the horizontal axis in the order they appeared in the genome and other coronaviruses are placed vertically the darkness of a pixel corresponds to the strength of the match between a sars-cov fragment and a coronavirus genome and the width of the rectangle corresponds to the length of the matched sequence the length of the longest matched segment is 138 nt codons 14914-15051 with the identity of about 8116 112138 this segment lies in the gene coding region of the r replicase protein of sars-cov we computed the average absolute distance of the motif frequency profile mfp between bj01 and other viruses the analysis results with the motif length from 2 to 8 nt all demonstrate that the sars-cov is most adjacent to coronaviruses here we only show the comparison result with coronaviruses since the distances with non-coronavirus are very large to present the similarity of the mfp between the sars-cov and other coronaviruses more clearly we use the chaos game representation cgr to demonstrate the results only one isolate is selected to represent its species because the mfp of different isolates within the same species is very similar to find whether there is a relationship between the viruses and their hosts we also demonstrate the mfp of homo sapiens host of the sars-cov and mus musculus host of the mhv figure 4 presents the dinucleotide frequency profile it is obvious that the frequency of dinucletide tt is rich in all the eight organisms bj01 mhv and pedv porcine epidemic diarrhea virus have another similar characteristic of the high frequency of tg the obvious difference between bj01 and other coronaviruses is that the aa frequency of bj01 is higher this aa-rich characteristic is the same to homo sapiens so probably in sars-cov it is influenced by its hosthomo sapiens the result that the mfps of homo sapiens and mouse are very similar to each other is in accordance with the phylogenetic analysis the lower frequency of cg in all the images could be easily explained by the reason that there is a relatively high chance of a methyl-c mutation into a t theoretically the c-t methyl mutation should induce the frequency increase of tg while the result shows that the frequency of tg is not high in about six organisms out of the eight so there should be some other mechanisms that lead to the decrease of tg in these organisms to see what contributes to the high content of tt we also did the mfp analysis with the motif length from 3 to 8 nt we found out that at motif length 4 almost all the tetranucleotide of coronaviruses with the highest frequency are tgtt except those in sars-cov figure 5 the richest tetranucleotide of the sars-cov is tgct while tgtt is the second this fact demonstrates that the sars-cov is phylogenetically far from other coronaviruses and this conclusion is the same as the serological analysis result to see whether this characteristic is unique to coronaviruses we searched 2497 virus genomes and found only two viruses beet soil-borne mosaic virus genome size 4616 bp ncbi accession number af061869 and soil-borne cereal mosaic virus genome size 3683 bp ncbi accession number aj132577 have this characteristic both these two exceptions are ssrna positively stranded viruses and belong to two different subspecies furovirus and benyvirus we computed the tgtt content of coronavirus genomes and the result is shown in table 1 as a comparison the contents of other viruses have also been computed but the results are not listed here the lowest content is 013 appeared in tt-like mini virus ncbi accession number af291073 and the highest content is 733 in hcov-229 the difference of tgtt frequency between different viruses is great nothing significant is found at other motif lengths thus the richest tetranucleotide tgtt could be a common characteristic of coronaviruses dna sequence data from various organisms have clearly shown that synonymous codons for each amino acid are not used with equal frequency even though choices among the codons should be equivalent in terms of protein structures the statistical data suggest that the choices among synonymous codons are consistently similar for all genes within a certain genome 5 6 7 generally speaking if two organisms were adjacent in evolution their codon usage bias should be similar 7 we made statistics of the codon usage frequency of all viruses and computed the standard deviation of their codon usage frequency relative to bj01 when we computed the codon usage frequency of the sars-cov the five function-known gene-coding regions for the r s spike e envelope m membrane n nucleocapsid and five putative uncharacterized proteins pup were all analyzed 8 results show that all other coronaviruses have a small difference of codon usage frequency with the sars-cov astonishingly some viruses that do not belong to coronavirus also have the same difference with the sars-cov such as human papillomavirus ncbi accession number u85660 this fact suggests that the codon usage bias is not valid at all conditions for the very similar codon usage of different strains of the same subspecies we selected only one of the several isolates in figure 6 the sars-cov has a similar genome organization especially in its gene orders with other members in coronavirus this is good evidence that the sars-cov is closely related with coronavirus the five proteins of the sars-cov whose functions had been known were compared with the proteins of other viruses the results demonstrated that these five proteins are similarest to the proteins of coronaviurses we aligned 42 complete genome sequences of the sars-cov by using the software crossmatch version 0990329 to look for variations with bj01 as the reference we found 338 substitution sites all the results are listed in the supplementary table substitution errors replacing a purine with a purine and a pyrimidine with a pyrimidine were more easily made for steric reasons the resulting mutations were transitions transversions purine to pyrimidine changes and the reverse are less likely made when resulting in an amino-acid change transversions often have a larger impact on the protein than transitions there are four possible transition errors ag ct and eight possible transversion errors ac at gc gt therefore if a mutation occurs randomly a transversion would be more likely than a transition however in many organisms transitions are two times more likely to occur than transversions 9 only one substitution occurred at each of the 338 substitution sites of which 225 were transitions including 98 ag transitions and 127 ct transitions and 113 were transversions including 40 ac 35 at 9 gc and 29 gt specifically the odds ratio of transition and tranversion was about 20 225113 which just equalled the universal possibility of 20 the statistics of types and codon phases of nucleotide substitution in coding region table 2 demonstrate that as long as the substitution number or rate is concerned there is no great difference among the three codon phases in the 98 mutations that happened at the first codon phase the number of non-synonymous substitutions is 93 and the rate is 95 9398 which is very close to the statistical possibility of 96 the 112 substitutions that happened at the second codon phase were all non-synonymous substitutions in the 119 substitutions that happened at the third codon phase the number of non-synonymous substitutions is 18 and the rate is 1513 18119 which is lower than the statistical possibility of 30 if we take the substitution type into consideration the first two substitution types are with 92 ag and 125 ct which constitute about 6596 217329 of the total number the substitution number of cg is the smallest only 9 to eliminate mutational noises induced by sequencing errors or other factors we only considered the forty-nine mutations found within two or more isolates the total transition number was 37 including 13 ag and 24 ct the total tranversion number was 12 including 3 ac 4 at and 5 gt the odds ratio of transition and tranversion was about 31 3712 larger than the universal possibility of 20 this change of the odds ratio from 20 to 31 means that we omitted some real substitution sites when we only considered those that happened in at least two isolates among 42 isolates of the sars-cov compared with bj01 zym1 has the highest substitution mutation rate it has 86 mutation sites with 62 non-synonymous substitutions and the whole genome mutation rate is 029 8629726 the strain that has the lowest substitution mutation rate is gd02 which has five mutation sites with four non-synonymous substitutions and the whole genome mutation rate is 0017 529726 42 new sequences were produced by using the nucleotides at the 338 substitution sites to represent the 42 isolates of viruses we used the software of clustalw to analyze these 42 new sequences and produced a phylogenetic tree figure 7 which is almost the same as another one produced by the 49 substitution sites that occurred in at least 2 isolates the only difference lies in the branch lengths of the tree there are obviously four groups in the tree group 1 mainly constituted by taiwan tw isolates 1015 is called tw group group 3 including 4 isolates from beijing bj 6 from guangdong gd and 3 from hong kong hk is called bj-gd group fra frankfurt1 and four isolates from singapore sp constitute group 4 which is named sp group due to the complex members in group 2 we could not give it a specific name the hk03 does not belong to any group because the difference between it and other isolates is maximal this group division is different from the one that was made on geography which suggests the complexity of virus propagation we found that there are two specific genotypes after analyzing six mutation sites that happened in at least ten isolates the first one corresponds to the positions 3838 11474 and 26458 the nucleotides of the eleven isolates gd03 tc1 tc2 tc3 twc2 twc3 twh twj twk tws twy at the three positions are all c t and g respectively the second one corresponds to the positions 17545 22203 and 27808 and the nucleotides of the eleven isolates bj01 bj02 bj03 bj04 gd01 gd02 gd04 gd05 gd06 gd07 cuhk-w1 at the three positions are all g c and c respectively compared with the division result above the eleven isolates corresponding to the first genotype all belong to tw group whereas the eleven isolates corresponding to the second genotype all belong to bj-gd group it is very unlikely that the ctg and gcc genotypes emerge by chance rather this should be the evidence for the genetic signature of strain differences in the sars-cov except for the single nucleotide substitutions there were some big segment insertions or deletions the 29-nt insertion has been reported in our former paper 10 our research has discovered the 29-nt insertion in two newly sequenced isolates gd02 gd05 as well as a 54-nt deletion and a 386-nt deletion in gd06 and hk02 respectively table 3 the region near codon 27863 seems like a hotspot because these five big segment insertions all occurred nearby the details will be shown in another paper the recombination in the rna virus genomes is a general phenomenon and is considered to play a major role as a driving force in the virus variability and thus in virus evolution an ever-increasing number of rna viruses has been shown to undergo the rna recombination whether under natural or experimental conditions 11 recent reports strongly suggest that rna recombination is related to the virus replication and occurs by a copy-choice mechanism 12 we analyzed the possible recombination between the sars-cov and other viruses especially other coronaviruses by using the software of simplot version 25 httpsraymedsomjhmieduraysoftsimplot but didnt find any hint of recombinations between the sars-cov and other viruses the he hemagglutinin-esterase gene found in some of the coronaviruses in group ii is homologous to that of the influenza c virus the he gene which is present between the orf1b and the s protein in group i and sometimes in group iii was not found in the sars-cov 13 however when we analyzed the comparison result manually we found a region in the bj01 genome has some similarity with the he gene many specific segments existing in the he gene sequence appear in this region and the order of these segments is the same to that in he gene so we postulate that the he gene exists in the sars-cov genome and a lot of mutations happened in this region have broken it and made it unfamiliar to us since it is not very important for the life and propagation of the sars-cov the complete genome sequences of 2497 isolates of viruses were obtained from genbank ncbigenbankftpncbinlmnihgovfeb-142003 they represent 493 species or subspecies and among them there are 11 isolates of coronaviruses table 4 until august 17 2003 32 complete genome sequences of the sars-cov had been submitted to genbank table 5 besides we have newly sequenced 10 complete sars-cov genomes table 6 all of our analyses included are referred to the sars-cov isolate bj01 except those specially mentioned analyses of the gc content or amino acid composition bias have long been a standard method in biological sequence research by extending a single nucleotide to longer words we could reveal more and more species-specific features 14 recent investigations have reported differences in the frequency of occurrence of many short oligonucleotides hereafter called motifs the existence of specific mfp has been reported for all motif lengths such as dinucleotides and trinucleotides for the sequence a with the length l there are l-m1 overlapped motifs when the motif length is m the total number of possible motif n is 4m computing the frequency of appearance of the n motif and put these n values in a fixed order we form a mfp vector a specific for the sequence a aa1 a2 a3  an here the ak k1 to n is a motif with the length m when m is 3 and a is the complete sequence of a gene a

pedersen c  feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv strains from six cats and three different geographic areas were compared genetically with feline enteric coronavirus fecv isolates obtained from cats inhabiting the same environments sequence comparisons were made from 12-to 89-kb segments on the 3 end of the genome fecvfipv pairs from the same catteries or shelters were 973995 related but were genetically distinct from fipv and fecv strains obtained from cats living in geographically distinct environments the high genetic similarity between fecvs and fipvs from the same environment strongly suggested a common ancestry based on the presence of deletion mutations in the fipvs and not in the fecvs it was concluded that fipvs evolved as mutants of fecvs the mutations are deletions in the fipvs and not insertions in the fecvs since similar sequences are present in other strains that have segregated earlier from a common ancestor therefore the order of descent is from fecv to fipv mutations unique to fipvs were found in open reading frames orfs 3c in 4 of 6 isolates andor 7b in 3 of 6 isolates when the study was extended to include 7 additional fipv isolates 1113 of the fipvs sequenced were found to have mutated 3c orfs  feline infectious peritonitis fip is a highly fatal infection of cats the disease was first recognized in the 1950s holzworth 1963 and is currently the leading infectious cause of mortality in young cats from pedigreed catteries and shelters the coronavirus etiology of this infection was first reported by ward 1970  seroepidemiologic studies of fip were first conducted using fipv-infected tissues as antigen substrates in an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay pedersen 1976  virtually all normal cats in households experiencing fip deaths were found to be seropositive suggesting that fip was an infrequent disease manifestation of a common infection however when fipv was isolated from naturally infected animals and experimentally transmitted to laboratory cats it caused fatal fip rather than inapparent disease  to further complicate the picture an antigenically indistinguishable feline enteric coronavirus fecv was also isolated from catteries where fip occurred  the fecv-induced antibodies strongly cross-reacted with fipv but caused only an inapparent or mild transient enteritis it was postulated therefore that fipv might be a relatively common and highly pathogenic mutant of the more ubiquitous fecv pedersen et al 1984 pedersen and floyd 1985  the validity of this mutational theory was questioned when so-called prototypic tissue culture-adapted strains of fipv strain wsu 79-1146 and fecv strain wsu 79-1683 were genetically compared the latter was found to have a major deletion in the 7b gene vennema et al 1992b  opposite to what would have been expected if fipv had mutated from fecv the mutational origin of fipv from fecv was given new credence following genomic comparisons of 12-kb fragments obtained from nine additional fecv and fipv isolates herrewegh et al 1995  all of these isolates had intact 7b genes indicating that the 7b gene deletion seen in fecv 79-1683 was associated with cell culture adaptation furthermore while geographically disparate isolates were genetically different fecv ucd and fipv ucd3 isolated from cats originating from the same facility were found to be highly related thus supporting a common origin for fecvs and fipvs the aim of this study was to accumulate direct evidence for fecv to fipv mutation and to identify regions within the fipv genome responsible for its unique pathogenicity in order to do this fecvfipv pairs were isolated from feces and tissues of diseased and normal cats inhabiting the same catteries or shelters genetic differences between virus strains in such pairs would be more likely associated with the fip-inducing phenotype than with geographic segregation genetic comparison of 1289 kb in the 3 one-third of the genome strongly suggests that fipvs evolve as simple mutations from fecvs endemic in the same environment although the precise genetic defect has not been identified deletions or nonsense mutations within the 3c open reading frame orf and less often point mutations in the 7b orf are present in fipvs but not in their fecv counterparts nucleotide sequence comparisons spanning a region of 23 to 89 kb were made between eight different fipv strains one previously sequenced strain of canine coronavirus ccv ccv insavc horsburgh et al 1992  and two strains of fecv rm and ucd  table 1  the two fecv isolates shared 897 nucleotide sequence identity in the 3 one-third of their genomes comprising all their genes except for the replicase gene fig 1  fipv ucd8 ucd9 and ucd10 were closely related to fecv rm 987995 while fipv ucd3 was strongly related to fecv ucd 987 the genetic relationships between the fecvs and other fipv isolates and ccv insavc were significantly more distant 701 to 931 the sequence identities among fipvs from different geographic areas were in the same range as those between them and the fecvs the degree of relatedness mirrored the origins of the various viruses fecv rm was isolated from the same group of cats as fipv ucd8 fipv ucd9 and ucd10 were obtained from cats infected with fecv rm while fecv ucd and fipv ucd3 originated from the same cattery fipv ucd1 ucd2 ucd4 ucd5 ucd6 tn406 and 79-1146 were all from catteries geographically distinct from where fecv rm and ucd were first found the serotype ii isolates fipv 79-1146 and ucd6 are more distantly related to the fecvs than the serotype i fipvs nucleotide sequence comparisons demonstrated that closely related pairs of different biotypes exist and that feline coronaviruses show a relativley high degree of genetic diversity the pairwise comparisons form the basis for phylogenetic analysis which clearly supports the evolutionary relationships in order to demonstrate that fipvs originated from fecvs mutations within the major structural genes were determined fipv ucd3 had a major in-frame deletion of 123 nucleotides in the s gene compared to fecv ucd and other strains this was confirmed by sequencing several overlapping pcr fragments deletions of one and two single codons were found in the s genes of fipv ucd3 and ucd8 compared to their respective fecvs fecv ucd and rm fig 2  furthermore fipv ucd3 had a deletion of 100 nucleotides in the 3c gene see below the occurrence of deletion mutations in fipvs and not fecvs of each pair confirmed the hypothesis that fipvs arose from fecvs the deleted sequences are still present in other strains based on phylogenetic analysis these strains diverged from a common ancestor before the epide- or with an acronym corresponding to the encoded protein s for spike e

information obtained for the listed feline coronavirus strains d scale representing kilobases miologically related fipvfecv isolates segregated therefore the mutations are deletions in the fipv genomes and not insertions in the fecv genomes the search for biotype-specific genotypic markers in the 3 one-third of the genomes of the fipvs ucd8 and ucd3 compared to the fecvs rm and ucd respectively resulted in the identification of only two consistent amino acid changes both located in the s gene mutations 3 and 6 fig 2  the same changes were not found in the s gene of fipv ucd9 which indicated that there was not one single consistent point mutation in the major structural protein genes in the 3 one-third of the genome that could be directly linked to transition to the fipv biotype mutation 3 fig  2  was a threonine to alanine substitution which abolished a potential n-glycosylation site in fipv ucd3 and ucd8 in fipv strains ucd1 tn406 and ku2 this glycosylation site was conserved motokawa et al 1996  mutation 6 was an aspartic acid to glycine substitution the glycine residue was also present in fipv strains ucd1 tn406 and ku2 motokawa et al 1996  in fipv ucd4 and ucd5 an alanine residue was found in this position fig 2b  the region in which mutation 6 can be found is highly conserved among coronaviruses in particular of serogroup 1 but also to some extent in mouse hepatitis virus mhv and infectious bronchitis virus ibv representing the other two serogroups in most cases the central part of this region contains two acidic residues one of which is mutated in all fipv strains except for fipv ucd9 two consistent mutations were identified in the 3 end of the orf 7b of all three fipvs derived from fecv rm and fipv ucd8 ucd9 and ucd10 compared to fecv rm two nucleotide differences resulted in two amino acid changes the c-terminal sequence nqhyktel of fecv rm was changed to nqhhrtel in all three fipv strains fig 3  however the most significant genetic differences between corresponding fecvs and fipvs were found in orf 3c fipv ucd3 was found to have a deletion of 100 nucleotides in orf 3c while fipv ucd9 had two deletions of 35 and 25 nucleotides compared to fecv ucd and fecv rm respectively fig 4  fipv ucd8 and ucd10 both derived from fecv rm did not have deletions in orf 3c seven additional fipv isolates also showed mutations in orf 3c fig 4c  fipv ucd1 had a deletion of 25 nucleotides fipv tn406 had a deletion of 62 nucleotides covering the 3 end of the 3b gene and the 5 end of the 3c gene the deletion resulted in readthrough of the orfs 3b and 3c fipv ucd2 had a small deletion of 4 nucleotides in addition this strain had mutations that affected the intergenic sequence upstream involved in mrna synthesis of the 3c gene the intergenic sequence was also mutated in both type ii feline coronaviruses fipv 79-1146 and fipv ucd6 fipv ucd4 ucd5 ucd6 and 79-1146 had nonsense mutations resulting in early termination animal-passaged fipv ucd4 also exhibited several overlapping deletion mutations in orf 3c remarkably the smallest of the deletions in fipv ucd4 was identical to the 35-nucleo- tide deletion in fipv ucd9 the 25-nucleotide deletion in fipv ucd1 was the same as the deletion found in fipv ucd9 and overlapped with the 100-nucleotide deletion in fipv ucd3 all deletions resulted in a shift to a different reading frame that soon terminated resulting in severe truncation of the 3c orf two littermate kittens from a shelter cats 6-51 and 6-53 developed fip during the study period rna was isolated from affected tissues of these fip-affected cats as well as from feces of a healthy littermate cat 6-49 the tissue-and feces-derived viral rnas were partially sequenced and the sequences of pairs fecv 6-49fipv 6-51 and fecv 6-49fipv 6-53 were compared the genetic homology between this fecv and the fipvs was 987 and 973 and was significantly higher than that between unrelated feline coronaviruses  table 2  the 7b orfs were intact and colinear in all of three strains however there were specific mutations in the 3c orfs of the fipvs but not in the fecv fig 5  deletions were present in the 3c orfs of fipv 6-51 and 6-53 both deletions resulted in a shift to a different reading frame like those of other fipv strains see above remarkably the deletions in fipv 6-51 and 6-53 were distinct demonstrating that these two fipvs were independently derived from fecv and not spread horizontally these fipvs from two diseased siblings were both related to a fecal isolate from a healthy littermate cat 6-49 feline coronaviruses have been classified into two serotypes i and ii and two biotypes fipv and fecv pedersen 1995 pedersen et al 1984  the predominant serotype i has a distinct spike protein while the less common serotype ii has a ccv-like spike protein fig 3 multiple sequence alignment of 7b protein amino acid sequences of fecv rm and its three derived fipv strains the fipv strains all have three amino acid differences with fecv rm two of these differences are the same in each case and involve two residues near the carboxy terminus of the protein  all of the various fipvsfecvs studied herein except for fipv ucd6 and 79-1146 were serotype i feline coronaviruses fipv ucd6 and fipv 79-1146 belonged to serotype ii based on the close genetic relationship of their spike proteins to ccv vennema manuscript in preparation  sequence comparisons demonstrated that fecvs and fipvs from the same group of cats were very closely related while significant genetic variation existed between fecvs and fipvs that were from different geographic areas this indicated that feline coronaviruses manifest a high degree of genetic drift independent of their serotype and biotype sequence comparisons demonstrated that fipvs originate as simple and relatively frequent mutations from fecvs endemic in the same environments the most compelling evidence to support this notion is the close relation between fecv rm and its three derivatives fipv ucd 8 9 and 10 fipv ucd8 occurred in the same closed group of cats into which fecv rm had been inadvertently introduced and fipv ucd9 and ucd10 were obtained directly from cats experimentally infected with fecv rm the origin of fipvs as mutations of fecv is also supported by epidemiologic studies fecv infection is rampant in multiple cat households while fip is sporadic foley et al 1997  the conclusion from the combined epidemiologic and molecular data could be that fipv unlike fecv is not transmitted from cat to cat but emerges as mutant of fecv within the cat in which it causes disease the potential of a fecv to undergo minor mutations that radically change its biotype is also consistent with what is known about coronaviruses in general their high mutability has led to a large number of strains of each species with each strain differing in cell tropism and disease potential compton et al 1993  as an example transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev of swine a virus closely related to fecv spontaneously mutated in the 1980s giving rise to the porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv which has displaced tgev in many areas laude et al 1993  the tgev to prcv mutation involves deletions in the s gene and point mutations andor deletions in gene 3 rasschaert et al 1990 wesley et al 1991  even though prcv is a relatively new virus numerous different strains of prcv have evolved in a decade or less vaughn et al 1994  most if not all prcv strains appear to be independently derived from tgev recombinations between various strains of coronaviruses have also been documented new pathogenic variants of mhv have arisen from recombination in vitro and in vivo between mhv 2 and mhv a59 keck et al 1988ab  new strains of ibv have apparently developed from recombination between field and attenuated live vaccine viruses kusters et al 1990  recombinations have also occurred between different species of coronaviruses serotype ii feline coronaviruses have apparently resulted from recombination in the field between serotype i feline coronaviruses and canine coronaviruses vennema manuscript in preparation  extensive sequence analysis and comparison did not point out a single mutation within a single gene that was consistently associated with the transition from fecv to fipv all but 1 of the fipv strains sequenced here and earlier had a specific mutation in the spike gene compared to the spike genes of two fecv strains all 3 fipv strains derived from fecv rm had two consistent differences compared to fecv rm in the carboxy-terminal part of the 7b protein gene this part is known to play a role in the secretion of the 7b protein vennema et al 1992a  the effect of the particular amino acid sequences in fecv rm and its derived fipvs on secretion of the 7b protein are currently under investigation differences affecting the genomic organization in fipvs compared to fecvs were noted in the 3c orf a total of 13 different fipv strains were ultimately analyzed and the 3c orf was mutated from wild type in all but 2 fipv ucd8 and ucd10 both related to fecv rm the 3c orf is the last of three orfs in the gene 3 region of fecvs and closely related ccv the orf 3c contains a nonsense mutation in ccv insavc horsburgh et al 1992  in fipv 79-1146 and in ccv k378 vennema and rossen unpublished data  but is intact in most but not all tgev and prcv strains vaughn et al 1994  in fig 5 deletion mutations in orf 3c from fipv strains in a shelter independent deletion mutations in 3c orfs of fipv 6-51 and 6-53 compared to fecv 6-49 from three littermates note that the 35nucleotide deletion in fipv 6-51 is in the same position as the 35nucleotide deletions in fipv ucd4 and ucd9 tgev and prcv the middle orf is missing here the orf corresponding to orf 3c of feline and canine coronaviruses is designated orf 3b no function has yet been associated with this orf and no protein encoded by this orf has been demonstrated in infected cells in vitro translation studies of mrna from tgev-infected cells demonstrated a 27-kda primary translation product jacobs et al 1986  the orf 7b is present in feline and canine but not in porcine coronaviruses vennema et al 1992b de groot et al 1988  the 7b protein of fipv 79-1146 is a secreted nonstructural protein which readily induces an immune response during natural and experimental infections vennema et al 1992a  in the tissue culture-adapted serotype ii strain fecv 79-1683 orf 7b is mutated by deletion while the same gene in the highly virulent fipv 79-1146 strain is intact vennema et al 1992b  however the non-tissue culture-adapted strain fecv ucd had an intact orf 7b herrewegh et al 1995  the same was true for the additional fecv strains sequenced for the present study sequencing of attenuated derivatives of virulent fipv strains showed a good correlation between deletions in the 7b gene and attenuation of virulence herrewegh et al 1995  this latter observation indicates that the 7b protein is important for virulence if this is true than this virulence associated with an intact 7b gene must be supressed somehow in the non-tissue cultureadapted fecvs in view of the data presented here it could be speculated that the intact 3c gene present in these fecvs is involved in this suppression what is the frequency of fip-inducing mutations during an outbreak of fecv only a half-dozen cases of fip occurred among several thousand specificpathogen-free cats that were inadvertently infected with fecv-rm hickman et al 1995  the incidence of fip however was 10 among a small group of chronically fiv-infected cats that were experimentally infected with the same strain of fecv poland et al 1996  the incidence of fip among large pedigreed catteries and shelters averages 5 and greater pedersen 1995 postorino-reeves 1995 foley et al 1997  assuming that most cats that are experimentally infected with fipv will ultimately die from fip it can be concluded that the fip incidence rate is an approximation of the actual fecv to fipv mutation rate the actual rate of mutation may be affected by at least three different factors 1 the level of fecv replication the greater the more chance for mutations to occur poland et al 1996  2 the acquired or inherited resistance of the particular breed bloodline or individual cat to the mutant virus foley and pedersen 1995 poland et al 1996  and 3 the strain of fecv and the ease with which it can be mutated six pairs of fecv and fipv each originating from the same cattery or shelter were obtained from naturally or experimentally infected cats the first pair fecv ucd fipv ucd3 was recognized as being genetically related by herrewegh et al 1995  fecv ucd and fipv ucd3 pedersen and floyd 1985 originated from the same experimental cattery but at different times the second pair fecv rmfipv ucd8 was isolated from a single closed specific-pathogen-free cat population that had been inadvertently infected with fecv and subsequently suffered sporadic cases of fip hickman et al 1995  the isolates were obtained an estimated 2 years after the initial introduction of fecv into the colony two new strains designated fipv ucd9 and ucd10 occurred when chronically feline immunodeficiency virus fiv-infected cats were experimentally infected with fecv rm at 8 and 10 weeks after inoculation respectively poland et al 1996  this resulted in a third fecv rmfipv ucd9 and fourth fecv rmfipv ucd10 pair pairs 5 and 6 were isolated at the same time from littermate kittens in a shelter in davis california and designated fecv 6-49fipv 6-51 and fecv 6-49fipv 6-53 unpaired fipv isolates used in the study included fipv ucd1  fipv ucd4 and ucd2 pedersen and floyd 1985  and fipv tn406 black 1980  fipv ucd5 and ucd6 were isolated from fipaffected cats originating from two different pedigreed persian catteries in northern california the viruses in ascitic fluid were passaged one time in specific-pathogen-free cats to confirm their virulence and saved in the form of ascites and cell-free omental extracts among these various fecvsfipvs only fipv ucd1 ucd2 ucd3 ucd4 and tn406 could be propagated in tissue culture tissue culture-adapted strains used in this study were passaged no more than five times in cell culture after being taken from affected animals animalpropagated strains were passaged one to three times in experimental cats and used in the form of either tissue homogenates fipv biotypes or fecal extracts fecv biotypes cdna

figure 1b demonstrates the overlapping pcr fragments designated by letter that were used to sequence this portion of the genome the coronavirus strains that were included in this study and the pcr fragments sequenced for each are presented schematically in fig 1c  the entire 3 one-third of the genome of two independent fecv isolates fecv ucd and fecv rm was sequenced as well as identical segments of their respective fipvs fipv ucd3 and fipv ucd8 fipv ucd9 and ucd10 both derived from fecv rm were sequenced for 45 kb downstream of the s gene and starting with fragment c several fragments of the s gene were also sequenced for these two strains sequences of a 25-kb segment covering gene 3 orfs 3a3c the e gene and the m gene were determined for the remainder of the fipv strains genomic rna was isolated from the materials mentioned above using published methods chomczynski and sacchi 1987  cdna synthesis was performed with m-mlv reverse transcriptase rt and followed by polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification with taq dna polymerase all enzymes were used according to the manufacturers instructions promega corp madison wi both reactions were primed with specific primers table 3  primers were derived from the sequence of fipv 79-1146 de groot et al 1988 vennema et al 1991  primers derived from the spike gene of fipv 79-1146 did not work with type i fecvsfipvs a set of overlapping fragments of the spike gene of fipv ucd3 was obtained as described previously  this sequence was used to design primers for the spike genes of other type i fecvsfipvs pcr

yamada to fung sing mei huang raymond chia ding liu xiang   coronaviruses are positive stranded rna viruses a typical coronavirus consists of few basic structural components these include the membrane m peplomer-like protein spike s and envelope e protein on the viral envelope and the nucleocapsid n protein which wraps the genomic rna inside the particles some coronaviruses encode an additional protein the hemagglutinin-esterase he a glycoprotein that forms smaller spikes on the exterior in addition to the s proteins infectious bronchitis virus ibv is the coronavirus that plagues the domestic fowl gallus gallus similar to other coronavirus s protein ibv s protein is a type i glycoprotein and forms the peplomers on virion particles giving the crown-like appearance the protein contains two glycopolypeptides s1 90 kda and s2 84 kda in equimolar proportions cavanagh 1983 
fig 1a the s1 subunit is believed to form the globular head of the protein and contains a receptor binding domain kubo et al 1994 the carboxy terminal s2 subunit however is conserved among all coronavirus spikes and forms a stalk-like structure that is embedded in the membrane masters 2006 overall this gives the spike protein a teardrop shaped structure masters 2006 mutagenesis of the terminal heptad repeats and the predicted fusion peptides severely compromises sars-cov s protein-mediated cell-cell fusion petit et al 2005 s protein-mediated cell-cell fusion is also dependent on a cysteine rich domain in the protein itself chang et al 2000 yet another point mutation glutamine to leucine at position 294 of the ibv spike s1 subunit hampers processing of the protein into a matured protein capable of being translocated to the cell surface shen et al 2004 one aspect of the s protein that remains largely unexplored is the role of its glycans glycans are mainly involved in protein post-translational modification and folding one of its most common forms is the n-linked glycosylation this involves a high mannose core being attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine n within a conserved motif asn-x-serthr where x is any amino acid except for proline in the er this mannose core is added in the form of a block of fourteen sugars glc3man9glcnac2 balzarini 2007 the mannose oligosaccharide then moves through the er and golgi apparatus during which it is altered to form different structures vigerust and shepherd 2007 coronavirus s proteins typically contain 2330 n-linked glycosylation sites depending on the species in question the protein is post-translationally glycosylated in the er delmas and laude 1990 following which it is transported through the golgi apparatus where high mannose oligosaccharides are trimmed and the protein further acylated the importance of glycans in s protein is likely to extend beyond protein modification and folding they may play an important role in viral receptor binding virus-cell and cell-cell fusion mutagenesis analyses of sars-cov s protein have identified seven glycosylation sites critical for dcl-sign-mediated entry an alternative site for sars-cov entry han et al 2007 interestingly mutation of multiple sites together did not have a synergistic effect on entry han et al 2007 on the other hand mutation of a single n-linked glycosylation site n330 abolishes the specific interaction between sars-cov s protein and mannose-binding lectin a serum protein that serves an important function in host defenses during opsonization and complement activation zhou et al 2010 mass spectrometry analysis has been used to determine the structure of the n-glycan on sars-cov s protein and major glycans were shown to be high-mannose man59glcnac2 hybrid and bi- tri- and tetra-antennary complex with and without bisecting glcnac and core fucose ritchie et al 2010 moreover treatment with glucosidase inhibitor inhibits n-glycan processing and replication of sars-cov in vero e6 cells ritchie et al 2010 carbohydrate binding agents found in plants are able to inhibit coronavirus infections by targeting the s and membrane glycans of the mouse hepatitis virus mhv and feline infectious peritonitis virus van der meer et al 2007 these results and those from other viruses show that the glycans on the s protein provide great avenues and potential for further exploration and understanding particularly in the area of protein mediated fusion carbohydrate binding agents may be a useful tool in combating viral pathogenesis in future as described by balzarini in 2007 these agents may act via a dual mechanism of antiviral action by firstly binding to the glycans and subsequently blocking virus entry or by creating deletions in the glycan shield of a particular viral surface inducing the immune system to act against otherwise hidden immunogenic epitopes before this becomes a full-fledged antiviral method more work needs to be done to characterize the function of carbohydrates in these viruses in particular the s protein here in this study 29 n-linked glycosylation sites on ibv s protein were predicted by netnglyc server 10 software among them 8 sites were confidently confirmed by proteomics approaches the functional importance of n-linked glycosylation in ibv s protein was further studied by mutagenesis of 13 predicted n-linked glycosylation sites in cluster i the impact of these mutations on s protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infectivity was investigated african green

full scan ms spectra were acquired from mz 3002000 da in the orbitrap mass spectrometer with a resolution of 60000 at mz 400 the 5 most intense ions with ion intensity above 1000 counts and charged

protein p11223 by the global proteome machine httpwwwthegpmorg searching engine for peptide identifications a reversed-concatenated database was used to determine the false discovery rate fdr the search criteria included trypsin as protease and additional cleavage sites induced by chymotrypsin at tyr trp and phe were added carbamidomethylation at cys was set as a fixed modification while deamidation at n and q with incorporation of o16 and o18 and oxidation at methionine were set as variable modifications 298 da at asn was also set as variable modification the maximum number of missed cleavages was set at 2 with the mass tolerance for precursor ions  04 da and for fragment ions  8 ppm identifications with less than 1 fdr were considered for further data analysis and msms spectra of all the peptide ions were manually inspected the amino acid sequence of s protein from the vero-adapted ibv beaudette strain p65 was subjected to analysis by netnglyc server 10 software blom et al 2004 this analysis predicts a total of 29 potential n-linked glycosylation sites in the ibv s protein fig 1b and
table 1 these sites were distributed in the s protein as three clusters with 13 sites in cluster i 9 sites in cluster ii and 7 sites in cluster iii fig 1a pgnase f mediated asn to asp conversion has been used to specifically identify n-glycosylation sites bailey et al 2012 the pngase f digestion results in the release of the n-linked glycans into the solvent and the glycosylated n within the n-linked glycosylation sequence motif n-x-stc could be converted to d by incorporating extra oxygen derived from the solvent 
fig 2a in addition deglycosylation occurring in h2o18 environment instead of h2o16 enables incorporation of o18 to asp which results in a mass increment of 298 da leading to more robust identification of glycosylated sites fig 2a however asn deamidation also occurs during sample preparation asn is converted to a succinimide intermediate that could further hydrolyze rapidly to produce l-aspartic acid and l-iso aspartic acid typically in a 13 ratio geiger and clarke 1987 it is thus possible that asn deamidation in h2o18 will lead to the mass increment of 298 da to avoid false positives a control without addition of pngase f would be set up for direct comparison with pngase f mediated deglycosylation as shown in fig 2b purified ibv was subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation with pngase f resulting in remarkable molecular weight shift of ibv s protein detected by western blot analysis of the deglycosylated s protein by lc-msms identified 8 n-linked gylcosylation sites including n212 n237 n247 n276 n513 n591 n1051 and n1074 
table 2 these sites are within the n-linked glycosylation sequence motif n-x-stc and the y ions and b ions generated matched well to their theoretical mz scores supplementary fig as examples two tandem mass spectrometric data of n212 and n276 glycosylation were shown in
fig 3 respectively in all these identified n-glycosylation sites none of them was present in the control sample without pngase f treatment suggesting that these identified glycosylation sites are derived from pngase f mediated de-glycosylation but not asn deamidation to analyze the functions of n-linked glycosylation on ibv replication the 13 predicted n-linked glycosylation sites in cluster i were mutated from asparagine n to aspartic acid d respectively by site-directed mutagenesis fig 1a and
table 3 asparagine to aspartate mutation represents the smallest change in molecular mass and both amino acids have similar polar side chains as well as a hydropathy index of 35 as our previous studies showed that expression of ibv s protein in vero cells using the vacciniat7 recombinant virus system induced formation of extensive cell-cell fusion xiao et al 2008 this expression system was then used to assess the impacts of these point mutations on s protein-mediated cell-cell fusion as summarized in table 3 and representative results shown in
fig 4a nd point mutations at positions 51 77 103 163 178 237 264 and 306 did not render significant impact on s protein-mediated cell-cell fusion significant reduction of cell-cell fusion was observed in cells expressing n144d and n247d and no induction of cell-cell fusion in cells expressing n212d n276d and n283d mutant constructs table 3 and fig 4a among them n212 n247 and n276 are confirmed n-linked glycosylation sites as shown in our proteomics analysis western blot analysis of protein samples collected at 18 h post-transfection detected the full-length glycosylated s protein from cells transfected with wild type and all mutant s constructs fig 4b but with varied expression efficiency among them wild type n51d n237d n264d and n306d were highly expressed and n77d n178d n276d and n283d were among the lowest expressed fig 4b the expression levels appeared not to be related to the cell-cell fusion induced by the constructs in addition expression of most constructs led to the detection of glycosylated s1s2 cleavage products but the level of s1s2 cleavage was variable among constructs fig 4b interestingly very limited cleavage of s protein to s1s2 was observed in cells transfected with n212d n276d and n283d constructs fig 4b as almost no cell-cell fusion was observed in cells transfected with these three constructs it suggests that cleavage of s protein to s1s2 might either be the cause or the consequence of cell-cell fusion mediated by coronavirus s protein a few more mutant s constructs with double glycosylation site mutations ie n5177d n103144d n77163d n144212d n163212d and n178212d were created expression of these mutant constructs showed reduced cell-cell fusion in cells expressing these constructs except n5177d which showed reduced induction of cell-cell fusion no apparent cell-cell fusion was observed in cells expressing all other double mutants fig 4a once again the expression of these structures led to the detection of the glycosylated full-length s protein but cleavage to s1s2 was much reduced in cells expressing most of these constructs fig 4c these mutations were then introduced into an infectious ibv cdna cloning system fang et al 2007 and their impact on the recovery of infectious virus was assessed recombinant viruses were recovered at 72 h post-electroporation from cells transfected with mutant full-length transcripts n51d n77d n103d n144d n163d n178d n237d n247d n264d and n306d table 3 interestingly no infectious virus was recovered from cells electroporated with n212d n276d and n283d full-length transcripts table 3 correlating well with the cell-cell fusion data that expression of mutant s protein harboring point mutation at these positions induced limited or no cell-cell fusion fig 4a these observations prompted further characterization of the replication infectivity and growth kinetics of a selected set of recovered mutant ibv including n51d n77d n103d n144d and n163d the selected set of mutant viruses were then analyzed by examining the syncytium formation in infected cells after passage of the recovered mutant ibv in vero cells twice tcid50 assay was performed to determine the viral titers and growth kinetics and western blot analysis was done to check the viral s protein expression in cells infected with these recombinant viruses as shown in
fig 5a in cells infected with n51d and n77d mutant viruses very similar syncytium formation with cells infected with wild type ibv was observed interestingly a mutant virus harboring n-d mutations at both n51 and n77 was also recovered this virus showed much reduced syncytium formation in infected cells fig 5a mild reduction in cells infected with n103d and n163d mutant viruses and much reduced formation of syncytia was found in cells infected with n144d mutant virus fig 5a western blot analysis of protein samples collected at 18 h post-infection detected similar levels of s protein expression in cells infected with wild type and n51d n77d and n103d mutants fig 5b mild reduction of s protein expression was observed in cells infected with n163 mutant and severe reduction of s protein expression was observed in cells infected with n5177d and n144d mutant viruses fig 5b these results are largely correlated with syncytium formation data shown in fig 5a tcid50 assay of the growth kinetics of wild type and mutant viruses was carried out with samples harvested at 0 4 8 12 18 24 and 36 h post-infection the results showed that n51d mutant virus displayed very similar growth kinetics as wild type virus both reaching the peak titer at 24 h post-infection fig 5c mutants n77d and n103d also showed similar growth kinetics as wild type virus but with 25 fold reduction in the peak titers fig 5c mutant n144d n163d and n5177d grew much slower than wild type virus at 24 h post-infection the titers of these mutant viruses showed 1025 fold reduction compared to wild type virus fig 5d the stability of these mutant viruses was checked by dna sequencing using a series of six primers covering the s gene confirming the presence of the mutations introduced into the recombinant viruses no other insertions deletions or mutations were found to be present in the s gene of these mutant viruses although asparagine to aspartate mutation represents the smallest change in molecular mass the negatively charged aspartate may have additional effects on the s protein independent of n-linked glycosylation to address this concern asparagine to glutamine q mutation was made in n144 n212 n247 n276 and n283 table 3 as summarized in table 3 mutations of n to q at positions n144 n212 n247 and n276 in ibv s protein render same effects on cell-cell fusion and viral recovery as n to d mutations mutation of n283 to q however generated a mutant s protein similar to wild type protein table 3 and
fig 6 as can be seen expression of n283q in vero cells showed induction of extensive cell-cell fusion fig 6a and efficient glycosylation and processing of the mutant s protein fig 6b the recovered recombinant virus containing this mutation displayed similar growth kinetics as wild type ibv with a 2-fold reduction in the peak titers at 24 h post-infection fig 6c these results suggest that n283 plays an essential role in viral replication and infectivity independent of n-linked glycosylation in this study the s glycoprotein of ibv was deglycosylated by pngase f in h2o18 solvent which induces asn-asp conversion that results in a mass increment of 298 da analysis was done by proteomics to identify the n-linked glycosylation sites in the ibv s glycoprotein a control was used to exclude any false positive caused by chemical deamination that can happen spontaneously during sample preparation the functional importance of 13 n-glycosylation sites in cluster i on ibv s protein-mediated membrane fusion infectivity and replication was characterized using mutagenesis analysis via both transfection of mutant s proteins and construction of recombinant viruses in sars-cov s protein certain positions are suggested to be of importance for binding to cellular components such as l-sign and dc-sign han et al 2007 ibv s protein-mediated fusion is not well understood and the importance of the s1 region of the protein in fusion is largely unknown with the postulation that glycans may play an important function the presence of a large number of glycosylation sites in this region suggests that it may play a role in this process this forms the motivation behind this study our results demonstrated that n-linked glycans at different positions may differentially affect s protein-mediated fusion and viral infectivity and replication positions n212 and n276 which are confirmed by lcmsms in particular show high influence when analyzed both for cell-cell fusion and recovery of infectious virus although the targeted sites were mutated to remove glycosylation there is a possibility though that the changes present were down to the mutations in amino acids rather than the absence of glycans themselves as mentioned earlier the change in molecular mass is minimal both amino acids also having similar polar side chains and hydropathy index taking the various protein folding forces into consideration it is thus unlikely that any conformational and binding changes as proposed earlier are due to the amino acids themselves given that glycans modify protein structures and assist in folding and interaction it is likely that they are the factors that determine the phenotypic changes on the other hand among the 29 software-predicted n-linked glycosylation sites only 8 sites could be validated using lc-msms analysis this seemingly under-representation could be partially attributed to the massive amount of ibv s protein produced during ibv infection and the limited capacities of the host cell glycosylation enzymes it is possible that due to their better spatial availability or other unknown advantages the asparagine residues at these 8 sites were preferentially modified by glycosylation the remaining sites were either inefficiently glycosylated or they might miss the chance of modification because the partially glycosylated ibv s protein has already been transported to the next compartment where glycosylation enzymes are no longer available it is also possible that there exists a detection limit for lc-msms set up during the time for sample analysis when one or more of the confirmed glycosylation sites in s protein was mutated the cellular glycosylation enzymes might be freed up so that n-linked glycosylation of the remaining sites could be observed in theory this could be studied by determining the n-linked glycosylation of virus particles from mutant recombinant ibvs using lc-msms analysis glycosylation of these redundant sites might be able to functionally complement the mutations on the canonical sites explaining why several of the ribv with these mutations could still be successfully recovered and grew well in cell culture interestingly the asparagine at 283 n283psg with the proline at 1 position should not be glycosylated in theory but its mutation to aspartate abolishes cell-cell fusion and recovery of recombinant virus to this end the same residue was mutated to glutamine and it was found that the n283q mutant supports both cell-cell fusion and virus recovery therefore it is concluded that the critical function of n283 is independent of n-linked glycosylation while n to d mutation involves a change in charge there is no net change in charge but only a small size increase of side chain for n to q mutation thus n283 might be positioned in a crucial domain in ibv s protein in which even minor charge but not size changes would disrupt delicate internal electrostatic interactions and lead to drastic modifications of protein structure and function proteolytic cleavage of the s protein into s1 and s2 subunits is essential for initiating fusion burkard et al 2014 yamada and liu 2009 each peplomer consists of two to three spike molecules already cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits it is possible that the two subunits need to interact in a certain way to form a proper peplomer as well as to facilitate binding to cellular receptors as the virus approaches the cell once again the presence or absence of glycans on the s1 region may affect its interaction with the s2 region thus affecting binding or even the formation of proper peplomers on complete viral particles this may help to explain why several of the mutant s proteins cannot induce cell-cell fusion as well as failing to recover recombinant mutants the observations that very low cleavage bands were seen when some mutant s proteins were expressed suggest that mutations at some glycosylation sites may also affect cleavage efficiency although the glycosylation sites near the cleavage site were not mutated coronavirus s protein is mainly synthesized in the er and n-linked glycosylation occurs mainly in the er lumen and golgi apparatus n-linked glycosylation significantly increases the size of s protein and has been shown to promote its folding and trimerization delmas and laude 1990 therefore it is reasonable to propose that changes of n-linked glycosylation status in the cluster i mutants may modify the proper folding processing andor trimerization of the s protein thus affecting its proteolytic cleavage pattern and compromising its fusogenic functions in the schematic diagram of fig 1a cluster i glycans are shown to be in the n-terminus region of ibv s protein and do not cover the s1s2 cleavage site and the fusion peptide however in the fully folded and trimerized coronavirus s protein the s1 subunits are closely associated with the s2 subunits in fact in a recent publication showing the cryo-electron microscopy structure of mhv s trimer the fusion peptides were exposed in the periphery and positioned very closed to the major antigenicity determinant in the s1 subunit walls et al 2016 if the cluster i n-linked glycosylation sites were located closed to critical regions of the s2 subunit the presenceabsence of n-linked glycans could affect the cleavage andor fusion ability this may explain why some n to d or n to q mutants in the cluster i sites could affect the s1s2 ratio or cell-cell fusion of the overexpressed s protein in this study we have identified 13 potential n-linked glycosylation sites in cluster i of the ibv s protein among them four n212 n237 n247 and n276 have been confirmed to be n-linked glycosylated in s protein originated from partially purified virions by proteomics studies n to dq mutations in n212 and n276 were found to abolish the infectivity of the recombinant ibv the receptor binding domain rbd on the s1 subunit of each coronavirus may vary with rbd of mhv located at the n-terminus kubo et al 1994 sars-cov at the center wong et al 2004 and tgev and hcov-229e at the c-terminus bonavia et al 2003 godet et al 1994 of the s1 region for the m41 strain of ibv the rbd has been mapped to the n-terminal 253 residues of the s protein which was both necessary and sufficient for 23-sialic acid-dependent binding to chicken respiratory tract promkuntod et al 2014 interestingly n212 was located within this putative rbd while n276 was also very closely positioned however the involvement of n-linked glycans at these two sites for ibv strain beaudette receptor binding both in cell culture and in vivo requires further investigations nonetheless the importance of n-linked glycosylation on receptor binding and viral infectivity has been well documented for sars-cov for example seven glycosylation sites n109 n118 n119 n158 n227 n589 and n699 in sars-cov s protein have been shown to be critical for virus entry mediated by the c-type lectin dc-sign and l-sign han et al 2007 furthermore mannose-binding lectin mbl has been shown to interact with sars-cov s-pseudotyped virus and block viral binding to dc-sign with another glycosylation site n330 on the sars-cov s protein found to be critical for mbl binding zhou et al 2010 it is intriguing that even if these n-link glycans may not directly participate in receptor binding they may be recognized by different lectin proteins and modulate the immune response during viral infection viruses are constantly needing new ways and mechanisms to evade antiviral mechanisms a host cell or system might impose since glycosylation patterns in different host cells differ viruses such as the west nile virus have been shown to be able to exploit different host glycosylation profiles to escape such mechanisms via exerting a specific cytokine blocking effect arjona et al 2007 other studies also showed that type i interferon and tnf- are further examples of substances differentially induced by varied glycosylation profiles it is possible that depriving the ibv s of certain glycans may alter its profile and make it more susceptible to antiviral actions by the host cell the possibility that recombinant ibv with glycosylation-defective at certain positions recovered in this study may be used to study such virus-host interaction would be worth exploring there are many forms of carbohydrate binding agents such as lectins carbohydrate binding agents have been shown to elicit favorable responses in hiv infected cells able to inhibit fusion of cell free hiv particles with susceptible cells and also the formation of syncytia between persistently infected and uninfected cells balzarini et al 1991 they are also able to prevent capture of viruses by dc-sign and the subsequent transmission of viruses to t-cells wang et al 2008 carbohydrate binding agents are unique as they will interact directly with the glycans present on the glycoproteins thus need not be taken up by cells also multiple binding of these agents to the glycoprotein exerts a high genetic barrier which means that if the virus was to mutate and evolve resistance by deletion of its n-glycans several mutations need to accumulate in the protein before a significant phenotypic drug resistance occurs whereas other drugs only require a couple of mutations to evolve resistance this method of antiviral treatment offers a more stable effect balzarini 2007 with the gradual improvement and increase in significance of carbohydrate binding agents as antivirals the ibv s glycoprotein should also come into the picture as one of the targets this would also lead to similar uses in other coronaviruses such as the sars-cov identifying regions of glycans that exert the most influence on viral infectivity and pathogenesis may facilitate design of such binding agents notably a recent study has evaluated the antigenicity of recombinant ibv s1 protein expressed in mammalian cells andoh et al 2015 result shows that although the recombination s1 protein is highly glycosylated and is able to induce antibodies against s1 in immunized chickens the antibodies have lower neutralizing activity compared to those in chickens immunized with inactivated virus andoh et al 2015 therefore the glycosylation patterns on ibv s proteins synthesized in mammalian cells might differ from those produced in avian cells thus accounting for the lacking of neutralizing epitopes during coronavirus infection the massive production of major structural proteins in particular the large and heavily glycosylated spike protein has been shown to impose enormous burden to the protein synthetic machinery of er leading to the er stress and induction of unfolded protein response upr fung et al 2014a fung et al 2016 in fact overexpression of the s protein of sars-cov and mhv induces potent er stress in cell culture chan et al 2006 versteeg et al 2007 while one or more of the three upr branches are activated in cells infected with sars-cov mhv tgev and ibv fung et al 2014b fung and liu 2014 liao et al 2013 however the involvement of n-glycan in spike-induced er stress has not been fully investigated in a previous study overexpression of sars-cov and hcov-hku1 spike proteins with multiple putative n-glycosylation site mutated was shown to activate upr reporter similarly to the wild type protein siu et al 2014 nevertheless the implication of spike protein n-glycosylation on cellular stress responses and other aspects of virus-host interactions should be further investigated under the context of actual infection  potential t-cell and b-cell epitopes of 2019-ncov ethan nash fast binbin chen  as of feb 16th 2020 2019-ncov has infected more than 51857 people across 26 countries and claimed 1666 lives 2019-ncov is a novel form of coronavirus that causes covid-19 and has high similarity with sars-cov no approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-ncov or any form of coronavirus here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-ncov t-cell and b-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties these epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies we identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles and two potential neutralizing b-cell epitopes near the 2019-ncov spike protein receptor binding domain 440-460 and 494-506 analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents we identified 96 coding-change mutations these mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good mhc-i presentation scores p002 no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain we validated our computational pipeline with sars-cov experimental data both humoral immunity provided by b-cell antibodies and cellular immunity provided by t-cells are essential for effective vaccines 10 11  though humans can usually mount an antibody response  cc-by-nc 40  coronaviruses cov first became widely known after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 they are are positive single-strand rna viruses that often infect birds and a variety of mammals and sometimes migrate to humans 1  while coronaviruses that infect humans usually present mild symptoms eg 15 of cases involving the common cold are caused by a coronavirus several previous outbreaks such as sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 2  have caused significant fatalities in infected populations 3  in december 2019 several patients with a connection in wuhan china developed symptoms of viral pneumonia sequencing of viral rna determined that these cases were caused by a novel coronavirus named 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 4 5  the virus has infected more than 51857 people across 26 countries as of february 16th 2020 according to a world health organization report 6  covid-19 the disease caused by 2019-ncov has led to death of 1666 patients and is clearly transmissible between humans 3  the deployment of a vaccine against 2019-ncov would arrest its infection rate and help protect vulnerable populations however no vaccine has yet passed beyond clinical trails for any coronavirus whether in humans or other animals 7 8  in animal models inactivated whole virus vaccines without focused immune epitopes offer incomplete protection 8  vaccines for sars-cov and mers-cov have also resulted in hypersensitivity and immunopathologic responses in mice 9 7  the diversity among coronavirus strains presents another challenge 9 1  as there are at least 6 distinct subgroups in the coronavirus genus and while sars-cov and 2019-ncov share the same subgroup 2b their genomes are only 77 identical 4  understanding the shared and unique epitopes of 2019-ncov will help the field design better vaccines or diagnostic tests for patients

with netmhcpan4 and maria for mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation respectively to identify potential t-cell epitopes our mhc-i analysis include common alleles for hla-a hla-b and hla-c and our mhc-ii analysis include common alleles of hla-dr against viruses only neutralizing antibodies can fully block the entry of viruses into human cells 12  the location of antibody binding sites on a viral protein strongly affects the bodys ability to produce neutralizing antibodies for example hiv has buried surface proteins that protect themselves from human antibodies 13  for this reason it would be valuable to understand whether 2019-ncov has potential antibody binding sites b-cell epitopes near their interacting surface with its known human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 beyond neutralizing antibodies human bodies also rely upon cytotoxic cd8 t-cells and helper cd4 t-cells to fully clear viruses the presentation of viral peptides by human major histocompatibility complex mhc or hla class i and class ii is essential for anti-viral t-cell responses 14  in contrast to b-cell epitopes t-cell epitopes can be located anywhere in a viral protein since human cells can process and present both intracellular and extracellular viral peptides 15  these immunology principles guide the design of our current study fig 1  first we focus on t-cell epitopes 2019-ncov carries 4 major structural proteins-spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n-and at least 6 other open reading frames orfs 1 16  all protein fragments have the potential to be presented by mhc-i or mhc-ii and recognized by t-cells we apply netmhcpan4 17 and maria 15  two artificial neural network algorithms to predict antigen presentation and identify potential t-cell epitopes next we focus on b-cell epitopes the spike s protein is the main trans-membrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of 2019-ncov and is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry to cells 1 18  we narrow our b-cell epitope search to s protein since it is the most likely target of human neutralizing antibodies discopte2 uses a combination of amino acid sequences and protein surface properties to predict antibody binding sites given a protein structure 19  we use this tool to identify potential 2019-ncov b-cell epitopes as the co-crystal structure of 2019-ncovs spike protein and antibody is yet available finally we examine the viral mutation pattern thanks to global sequencing efforts 20  we are able to obtain a cohort of 68 2019-ncov genomes from four continents based on the resulting viral mutation profile we examine whether mutations are driven by the immune selection pressure highly mutated regions might be excluded from the vaccine candidate pool we obtained 2019-ncov sars-cov-2019 and sars-cov reference sequence data from ncbi genebank nc045512 and nc004718 16 4  we then extracted the 2019-ncov protein sequences of orf1ab s orf3a e m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 n and orf10 based on the reference genome we obtained viral sequences associated with 68 patients from gisaid on feb 1st 2020 supplementary table 1  20  genomes with single protein are not included in the analysis we broke each gene sequence in 2019-ncov into sliding windows of length 9 the median length of mhc-i ligands and 15 the median length of mhc-ii ligands we used netmhcpan4 17 and maria 15 to predict mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation scores respectively we used 32 mhc alleles common in the chinese population 4 allele frequency 7 hla-a 8 hla-b 9 hla-c 8 hla-drb1 as determined by an analysis of human populations 21  the complete list of common mhc alleles is included in supplementary table 2  both maria and netmhcpan4 return percentiles that characterize a peptides likelihood of presentation relative to preset distribution of random human peptide scores prior work recommends thresholds of 98 for netmhcpan4 and 95 for maria to determine reasonable presenters we also applied our analysis with a more stringent 995 threshold for both netmhcpan4 and maria we used gene expression values of 50 tpm when running maria to reflect the high expression values of viral genes in human cells when aggregating alleles across mhc-i and mhc-ii to report overall coverage we marked a peptide sequence as covered if it is presented by more then 33 of common alleles we chose 33 as a cut-off because it suggests a high 90 probability that at least one allele can present this peptide assuming the patient carries six mhc alleles eg 2 as 2 bs and 2 cs and the distribution of common mhc alleles in the population is random we ranked potential t-cell epitopes based on their mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation coverage across alleles we applied our methodology to known sars t-cell epitopes and non-epitope sars peptides to estimate our ability to predict 2019-ncov epitopes for mhc-i we curated 17 experimentally determined hla-a0201 associated cd8 t-cell epitopes and 1236 non-epitope 9mer sliding windows on sars s protein 22 23 24  for mhc-ii we curated 3 experimentally determined cd4 t-cell epitopes and 246 non-epitopes on sars s protein 25  no specific hla-dr alleles were reported in the original study so we used hla-drb10901 and 1501 common alleles to run maria to calculate sensitivity and specificity for this validation set we labeled any peptide sequence above the 98th mhc-i or 95th mhc-ii percentile as a positive epitope prediction any sequence below that threshold we labeled as a negative prediction we calculated auc scores auroc to estimate the overall performance of our methodology we obtained an approximate 3d structure of 2019-ncov s protein by homology modeling sars s protein pdb 6acc with swiss-model 26 27  s proteins from 2019-ncov and sars share 93 similarity the modeled structure of 2019-ncov s protein has a qmean of -363 table 1  summary of potential 2019-ncov t-cell epitope candidates based on hla antigen presentation scores the hla-a hla-b hla-c and hla-dr columns

file 1 we used a computational docking algorithm cluspro2 28  to estimate the interactive surface of 2019-ncov with its known human receptor ace2 5 supplementary file 2 graphic rendering and analysis was performed with pymol 29  we predicted likely human antibody binding sites b-cell epitopes on sars and 2019-ncov s protein with disctope2 19  our analysis focused on neutralizing binding sites by only examining residues 1-600 the full prediction results can be found in supplementary  we aimed to determine whether there was any statistical relationship between regions of mutation and presentation we translated viral genome sequences into protein sequences using biopython 33 and indexes from the ncbi reference genome 2019-ncov nucleotide position 13468 contains a -1 frame shift signal and we adjusted accordingly to generate orf1ab we compared protein sequences from 68 patients to the reference sequence to identify mutations with edit distance analysis positions with poor quality reads eg w or y were excluded from the analysis the full sequence and mutation profiles can be found in supplementary  we computed fishers exact test with scipy 34 and auroc with scikit-learn 35  we scanned 11 2019-ncov genes with netmhcpan4 and maria to identify regions highly presentable by hla complexes human mhc a epitope is labeled positive if presentable by more than one third of common alleles among the chinese population we display a summary of our t-cell epitope findings in table 1  in fig 2 we show regions of strong mhc presentation across hla-a hla-b hla-c and hla-dr alleles both at a medium threshold  fig 2a  and at a high threshold  fig 2b  consistent with the similar finding from sars-cov proteins orf1ab s and e contain high numbers of presentable antigen sequences across both mhc-i and mhc-ii 8  these highly presentable peptides on functional viral proteins provide a candidate pool for t-cell epitope identifications and epitope-focused vaccine design the presentation scores of individual antigen peptides can be found in supplementary table 5 6 netmhcpan4 predicts that a larger number of 2019-ncov protein sequences can be presented by hla-c alleles across all genes fishers exact test p  42e 59  compared to hla-a or hla-b table 1  specifically orf1ab p  67e 54  s p  14e 9  orf3a p  001 and m p  0025 can be better presented by hla-c alleles after bonferroni correction this might be due to relatively conserved hla-c binding motif on the 9th position the main anchor residue where leucine methionine phenylalanine tyrosine are commonly favored across alleles 36  hla-c0702 hla-c0102 and hla-c0602 all have 10 allele frequency in the chinese population 21  this suggests the future epitope-based vaccines should include hla-c related epitopes beyond the common hla-a0201 and hla-b4001 approach to estimate the ability of antigen presentation scores to identify 2019-ncov t-cell epitopes we performed a validation study with known sars-cov cd8 and cd4 t-cell epitopes fig 3  the copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer-reviewed is the  figure 3  validation of netmhcpan and maria for t-cell epitope identification with sars-cov s protein epitopes netmhcpan4 and maria presentation percentiles were used to differentiate experimentally identified cd8 t-cell epitopes mhc-i n17 22 23 24 and cd4 t-cell epitopes mhc-ii n3 25 from negative peptides n1236 and 246 negative peptides for cd8 t-cell epitopes are all 9mer sliding windows of s protein without a reported epitope negative peptides for cd4 t-cell epitopes are experimentally tested a netmhcpan4 has a sensitivity of 823 and specificity of 970 with a 98th presentation percentile cut-off and an overall auc of 098 b maria has a sensitivity of 666 and specificity of 911 with a 95th presentation percentile cut-off and an overall auc of 083 independent experimental studies 22 23 24 25  we identified known cd8 t-cell epitopes mhc-i n17 and known cd4 t-cell epitopes mhc-ii n3 we also obtained known non-epitopes n1236 and 246 for cd4 while for cd8 we include all 9mer sliding windows of s protein without a known epitope as non-epitopes mhc-i presentation with recommended cut-off 98 17  has a sensitivity of 823 specificity of 970 and an auc of 098 fig 3a  mhc-ii presentation recommended cut-off 95 15  has a sensitivity of 666 specificity of 911 and an auc of 083 fig 3b  given the high similarity between sars-cov and 2019-ncov proteins we expect our analysis on 2019-ncov to perform similarly against future experimentally validated t-cell epitopes the detailed scores and sequences of this analysis can be found in supplementary table 7 and 8 human immune selection pressure has been shown to drive viral mutations which evade immune surveillance eg low mhc presentation we hypothesize that a similar phenomenon can occur in 2019-ncov we curated a cohort of 68 viral genomes across four continents and identified 93 point mutations 2 nonsense mutation and 1 deletion mutation compared to the published reference genome 5  we plot point mutations against regions of mhc-i or mhc-ii presentation in fig 4  the full protein sequence and mutation information can be found in supplementary table 9  10 mutations occur in most genes with the exception of e orf6 orf7b and n we identify a recurrent mutation l84s in orf8 in 20 samples mutations are more likely to occur in regions with mhc-i presentation fischers exact test p  002 no relationship was observed with mhc-ii p  058 or an aggregate of mhc-i and mhc-ii p  014 this is consistent with the role of cd8 t-cell in clearing infected cells and mutations supporting the evasion of immune surveillance 37  be presented by multiple mhc alleles as indicated in our heatmap fig 4  in a sample from japan epiisl407084 the viral gene orf1ab loses nucleotides 94-118 which code for gdsveevl an associated antigen fgdsveevl is predicted to be good presented by multiple mhc-i alleles eg 999 for hla-c0801 992 for hla-c0102 and 990 for hla-b3901 in summary we observed that 2019-ncov mutations often occur among or delete presentable peptides a potential form of immune evasion patient mhc allele information and t-cell profiling are needed to better assess this phenomenon however patients typically carry fewer than 3 mutations so a vaccine against multiple epitopes will not be nullified by such a small number of mutations we obtained the likely 3d structure of 2019-ncovs spike protein supplementary file 1 by homology modeling with sars-covs spike protein pdb 6acc we scanned both spike protein structures with discotope2 to identify potential antibody binding sites on the protein surface fig 5  for the sars-cov s protein we identified a strong cluster of antibody sites 30 residues pink or red on the receptor binding domain rbd the ace2 interacting surface three independent studies 32 30 31  discovered b-cell epitopes in this region blue with a combination of in vitro and ex vivo approaches additionally discotope2 identifies residue 541-555 as another binding site which was supported by two independent studies fig 5a blue 30 31  this gives us some confidence in the ability of discotope2 to predict b-cell epitopes if given a unknown protein structure for the 2019-ncov s protein discotope2 identified a similar antibody binding site on s protein potential rbd but with fewer residues 17 residues fig 5b  with computational protein-protein docking we predicted one potential interacting conformation between the 2019-ncov s protein and the human ace2 entry receptor fig 5c  the main antibody binding site substantially overlaps with the interacting surface where ace2 binds to s protein and an antibody binding to this surface is likely to block viral entry into cells discotope2 identified anther antibody binding site residue 246-257 different from sars-cov but with lower scores -25 raw scores 3d structures of both spike protein were scanned with discotope2 to assess potential antibody binding sites b-cell epitopes red indicates residues with score  05 cut-off for specificity of 90 and pink indicates residues with score  -25 cut-off for specificity of 80 a the receptor binding domain rbd of sars spike protein has concentrated high score residues and is comprised of two linear epitopes one additional binding site is predicted to be around residue 541-555 three independent experimental studies 32 30 31 identify patient antibodies recognize these three linear epitopes blue b 2019-ncov spike protein is predicted to have a similar strong antibody binding site near rbd and an additional site around residue 246-257 c the predicted antibody binding site on 2019-ncov rbd potentially overlaps with the interacting surface for the known human entry receptor ace2 yellow d eight 2019-ncov spike protein point mutations are present in a cohort of 68 viral samples no mutations are near the ace2 interacting surface one mutation s247r occurs near one of the predicted antibody binding sites residue 246-257 table 2  top potential epitopes for key 2019-ncov proteins we ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles s protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on mhc presentation and is also one of the predicted top b-cell epitopes localized near the s protein receptor binding domain  figure 5  mhc-i coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest mhc-i coverage for each epitope highlighted in orange all candidates are likely to be presented by both mhc-i and mhc-ii a question mark  under the antibody column indicates that one or more sars homolog of this peptide is a known b-cell epitope we identified 8 point mutation sites on s protein from a cohort of 68 2019-ncov samples fig 5d  all mutations are apart from the protein s rbd and one mutation s247r occurs near one of the predicted minor antibody binding site residue 246-257 in summary we observed major structural and b-cell epitope similarity between sars-cov and 2019-ncov spike proteins a recent cryo-em study of 2019-ncov s protein 18 supports such structural similarity and it would be informative to rerun our analysis once the cryo-em crystal structure becomes publicly available rbds in both proteins seem to be important b-cell epitopes for neutralizing antibodies however sars-cov appears to have larger attack surface than 2019-ncov fig 5a 5b  fortunately we have not observed any mutations altering binding sites for this major b-cell epitope in 2019-ncov after understanding the landscape of t-cell and b-cell epitopes of 2019-ncov we summarize our results in table 2 for promising candidates for 2019-ncov vaccines ideal antigens should be presented by multiple mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles in a general population and contain linear b-cell epitopes associated with neutralizing antibodies specifically we first identified regions with high coverage of mhc-ii then ranked them based on their mhc-i coverage we further search these top candidates with 90 sequence similarity on iedb 38 to assess whether any candidate has been previously reported for being a b-cell epitope or t-cell epitope around 1000 peptide 15mers can be presented by a wide range of mhc-ii 33 which is consistent with our knowledge about promiscuity of mhc-ii presentation 15 39  when further requiring a peptide to be presented by more than 33 or 66 of common mhc-i alleles we narrowed the results to 405 or 44 promising t-cell epitopes respectively supplementary table 5  6 the top 13 candidates in key viral proteins can be presented by 52-83 of mhc-i alleles  table 2  most notably s protein 494-508 is not only a good mhc presenter but also a predicted b-cell epitope near the s protein receptor binding domain fig 5b  which indicates a good vaccine candidate in summary we analyzed the 2019-ncov viral genome for epitope candidates and found 405 likely t-cell epitopes with strong mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation scores and 2 potential neutralizing b-cell epitopes on s protein we validated our methodology by running a similar analysis on sars-cov against known sars t-cell and b-cell epitopes inspecting 68 samples we found that viral mutations have a tendency to occur in regions with strong mhc-i presentation which can be a form of immune evasion however no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain which is critical for viral entrance to cells and neutralizing antibody binding similar to sars-cov 1 8  the 2019-ncov spike protein is likely to be immunogenic as it carries a number of both t-cell and b-cell epitopes recombinant surface protein vaccines have demonstrated strong clinical utilities in hepatitis b and human papillomavirus hpv vaccines 11 45  a recombinant 2019-ncov spike protein vaccine combined with other top epitopes and an appropriate adjuvant could be a reasonable next step for 2019-ncov vaccine development from an economic perspective the development of coronavirus vaccines faces significant financial hurdles as most such viruses do not cause endemic infections after an epidemic episode eg sars there is little financial incentive for private companies to develop vaccines against a specific strain of virus 10 2 8  to address these incentive issues governments might provide greater funding support to create vaccines against past and future outbreaks our pipeline provides a framework to identify strong epitope-based vaccine candidates-beyond 2019-ncov-and might be applied against any unknown pathogens previous animal studies do show antigens with high mhc presentation scores are more likely to elicit strong t-cell responses but the correlation between vaccine efficacy and t-cell responses is relatively weak 14 46 7  when combined with future clinical data our work can help the field untangle the relationship between antigen presentation scores and vaccine efficacy supplementary   genomic mutations and changes in protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility of sars-cov-2 covid-19 virus thanh nguyen thi pubudu pathirana n thin nguyen henry nguyen asim bhatti dinh nguyen c dung nguyen tien ngoc nguyen duy douglas creighton mohamed abdelrazek  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that has caused the global covid-19 pandemic tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies this paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of sars-cov-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes which are predicted using deep learning models prediction results suggest that mutation d614g in the virus spike protein which has attracted much attention from researchers is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility based on 6324 viral genome sequences we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of sars-cov-2 in many perspectives especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus our analysis results also show that coding genes e m orf6 orf7a orf7b and orf10 are most stable potentially suitable to be targeted for vaccine and drug development  biological investigations of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 are important to understand the virus and help to propose appropriate responses to the pandemic scientists have been able to obtain genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 and have started analysis of these data reference genome of sars-cov-2 deposited to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genbank sequence database isolate wuhan-hu-1 accession number nc045512 shows that sars-cov-2 is an rna virus having a length of 29903 nucleotides comparative genomic analysis results obtained in 1 2 3 suggest that the covid-19 virus may be originated in bats other studies show that pangolins may have served as the hosts for the virus 4 5  andersen et al 6 furthermore believe that sars-cov-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus or constructed in a laboratory but has a natural origin a study in 7 using machine learning unsupervised clustering methods corroborates previous findings that sars-cov-2 belongs to the sarbecovirus subgenus of the betacoronavirus genus within the coronaviridae family 8 9  the whole genome analysis results also indicate that bats are more likely the reservoir hosts for the virus than pangolins another study in 10 demonstrates that sars-cov-2 may have resulted from a recombination of a pangolin coronavirus and a bat coronavirus and pangolins may have acted as an intermediate host for the virus since the first cases were detected the covid-19 virus has spread to almost every country in the world and has been linked to the deaths of more than 404000 people of over 7 million confirmed cases 11  tracing the evolution and spread of the virus is important for developing vaccines and drugs as well as proposing appropriate intervention strategies monitoring and analysing the viral genome mutations can be helpful for this task due to a strong immunologic pressure in humans the virus may have mutated over time to circumvent responses of the human immune system this leads to the creation of virus variants with possible different virulence infectivity and transmissibility 25  this paper reports all point mutations occurring so far in sars-cov-2 and presents exemplified implications obtained from the analysis of these mutation pattern data four types of mutations which include synonymous nonsynonymous insertion and deletion are detected we use 6324 sars-cov-2 genome sequences collected in 45 countries and deposited to the ncbi genbank so far and create a spreadsheet dataset of all mutations occurred across different genes eleven protein coding genes of sars-cov-2 have been identified namely orf1ab spike s orf3a envelope e membrane m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 nucleocapsid n and orf10 the order of these genes and their corresponding length are illustrated in fig 1  the genes s e m and n produce structural proteins that play important roles in the virus functions for example the receptor-binding domain rbd region of the s protein can bind to a receptor of a host cell eg the human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor enabling the entrance of the virus into the cell 12  predictions of protein structures may help understand the viruss functions and thus contribute to developing vaccines and therapeutics against the virus in this paper to evaluate the possible impacts of genomic mutations on the virus functions we propose the use of the ssproaccpro 5 methods to predict protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility 13  these predictors were built using deep learning one-dimensional bidirectional recurrent neural networks incorporated in the scratch-1d soft- ware suite version 12 2018 14  by comparing the prediction results obtained on the reference genome and mutated genomes we are able to assess whether the detected mutations have the potential to change the protein structure and solvent accessibility and thus lead to possible changes of the virus characteristics because of the functional importance of structural proteins we only report the prediction results of these proteins in this study the next section reviews related works in the literature we then present materials and methods for sars-cov-2 mutation detection and protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction next we summarize statistics of sars-cov-2 mutations so far and implications of these mutations details of mutations in nonstructural orf genes and structural s e m and n genes are presented after that a full sars-cov-2 mutation spreadsheet report is provided in the supplemental information since the first genomes were collected in december 2019 there have been many findings on the mutations of sars-cov-2 for example phan 15 analysed 86 genomes of sars-cov-2 downloaded from the the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg and found 93 mutations over the entire viral genome sequences among them there are three mutations occurring in the rbd region of the spike surface glycoprotein s including n354d d364y and v367f with the numbers showing amino acid aa positions in the protein that study also reveals three deletions in the genomes of sars-cov-2 obtained from japan usa and australia two of these deletion mutations are in the orf1ab polyprotein and one deletion occurs in the 3 end of the genome likewise a study in 16 shows that the sars-cov-2 genomes may have undergone recurrent independent mutations at 198 sites with 80 of these are of the nonsynonymous type tang et al 17 investigated 103 genomes of covid-19 patients and discover mutations in 149 sites of these genomes the study also shows that the spike gene s consistently has larger ds values synonymous substitutions per synonymous site than other genes in addition two major lineages of the virus denoted as l and s have been specified based on two tightly linked snps the l lineage is found more prevalent than the s lineage among the examined sequences korber et al 18 tracked the mutations of spike protein s of sars-cov-2 because it plays an important role in mediating infection of targeted cells and is the focus of vaccine and antibody therapy development efforts 19  they detected 14 mutations in the spike protein that are growing especially the mutation d614g that rapidly becomes the dominant form when spread to a new geographical region likewise hashimi 20 analysed the mutation frequency in the spike protein s of 796 sars-cov-2 genomes downloaded from the gisaid and genbank databases the study found 64 mutations occurring in the s protein sequences obtained from multiple countries it suggests that the virus is spreading in two forms the d614 form residue d at position 614 in the s protein takes 685 while the g614 form takes 315 proportion of the examined isolates koyama et al 21 on the other hand found several variants of sars-cov-2 that may cause drifts and escape from immune recognition by using the prediction results of b-cell and t-cell epitopes in 22  typically the mutation d614g occurring in the spike protein is found prevalent in the european population this mutation may have caused antigenic drift resulting in vaccine mismatches that lead to a high mortality rate of this population a recent situation report 23 by nextstrain 24 on genomic epidemiology of novel coronavirus using 5193 publicly shared covid-19 genomes shows that sars-cov-2 on average accumulates changes at a rate of 24 substitutions per year this is approximately equivalent to 1 mutation per 1000 bases in a year this evolutionary rate of sars-cov-2 is typical for a coronavirus and it is smaller than that of influenza average 2 mutations per 1000 bases per year and hiv average 4 mutations per 1000 bases per year shen et al 25 conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained from 8 patients with covid-19 and found no evidence for the transmission of intrahost variants as well as a high evolution rate of the virus with the number of intrahost variants ranged from 0 to 51 around a median number of 4 pachetti et al 26 examined 220 genomic sequences of covid-19 patients from the gisaid database and discovered 8 novel recurrent mutations at nucleotide locations 1397 2891 14408 17746 17857 18060 23403 and 28881 mutations at locations 2891 3036 14408 23403 and 28881 are mostly found in europe while those at locations 17746 17857 and 18060 occur in sequences obtained from patients in north america likewise a study in 27 on 95 sars-cov-2 complete genome sequences discovered 116 mutations among them the mutations at position c8782t in the orf1ab gene t28144c in the orf8 gene and c29095t in the n gene are common we use 6324 sequence records downloaded from the ncbi genbank database on 2020-06-17 the latest collection date for the samples from which the sequences were derived was on 2020-06-05 the data which were collected in 45 countries include both nucleotide sequences and protein translations of coding genes a proportion of the 6324 records have sequences of only few proteins ie these records do not annotate all 11 proteins orf1ab orf3a orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 orf10 s e m and n the number of available sequences is thus different from one protein to another see column avai num in table 1  genome sequences that do not specify country or aa sequences that contain letter x representing an unknown aa are excluded in our calculations we use the genome obtained from the isolate wuhan-hu-1 accession number nc045512 as the reference genome for the mutation detection purpose we apply a dynamic programming algorithm to protein aa sequences to get global pairwise alignments between a reference sequence and a query sequence specifically we use the python biopairwise2alignglobalms function httpsbiopythonorgdocsdevapibiopairwise2html where a match is given 2 points a mismatch is deducted 05 points 2 points are deducted when opening a gap and 1 point is deducted when extending it gaps are then inserted into nucleotide sequences corresponding to the resulted protein sequence alignments using the resulted pairwise alignments we are able to compare query sequences and the reference sequences at each position and identify locations of insertion deletion synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations virus protein structure plays a key role in its functions and a change in structure shape may affect its functions virulence infectivity and transmissibility possibly resulting in non-functional proteins protein secondary structure is defined by hydrogen bonding patterns which make an intermediate form before the protein folds into a three-dimensional shape composing its tertiary structure eight types of protein secondary structure defined by the dictionary of protein secondary structure dssp include 3 10 helix g  helix h  helix i hydrogen bonded turn t extended strand in parallel andor anti-parallel -sheet conformation e residue in isolated -bridge b bend s and coil c the dssp tool assigns every residue to one of the eight possible states in a reduced form these 8 conformational states can be diminished to 3 states h  h g i e  e b and c  s t c 28  the protein secondary structure represents interactions between neighboring or near-by aas as its functional three-dimensional shape is created through the polypeptide folding we thus determine a change in protein secondary structure if any change happens in the structures of the mutated aa and its 10 neighboring aas compared to those of the reference sequence in detail we consider 5 aas ahead and 5 aas behind the mutated aa the same approach is applied when considering a change of the protein relative solvent accessibility solvent-exposed area represents the area of a biomolecule on a surface that is accessible to a solvent accordingly a residue is considered as exposed if at least 25 of that residue must be exposed denoted as the e state alternatively the residue is determined as buried ie the b state there have been various protein secondary structure prediction programs in the literature and many of those were developed based on artificial intelligence models using protein aa sequences such as jpred4 29  spider2 30  porter 5 31  raptorx 32  psspred 33  yasspp 34 and sspro 13  in this paper we use the protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility prediction methods ssproaccpro 5 13 within the scratch-1d software suite release 12 2018 14  these predictors were built using the bidirectional recursive neural networks and a combination of the sequence similarity and sequence-based structural similarity to sequences in the protein data bank 35  prediction results of 8-class structure sspro8 predictor and 25-threshold relative solvent accessibility accpro predictor are used for statistics on protein secondary structure and accessibility changes we however also report in the spreadsheet supplemental information prediction results of 3-class structure sspro predictor and relative solvent accessibility on 20 thresholds ranging from 0 to 95 with a 5 step the accpro20 predictor within the scratch-1d software table 1 summarizes statistics of sars-cov-2 mutations so far aa length indicates the length of the protein aa sequence derived from the sars-cov-2 reference genome avai num denotes the number of records among 6324 ncbi genbank records that have the complete sequence of the corresponding protein no mu refers to the number of sequences that do not have any mutations compared to the reference sequence delete means the number of deletion mutations occurring in the aa sequences of the protein this number may be larger than the number of sequences having deletion mutations because an aa sequence may have more than one deletion likewise insert nonsyn and syn show the number of insertion nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations occurring in the protein aa sequences nonsynsyn demonstrates a ratio between the number of nonsynonymous mutations versus the number of synonymous mutations struct change means the number of nonsynonymous mutations that have protein secondary structure change potential based on the sspro8 predictor of the scratch-1d software similarly acc change refers to the number of nonsynonymous mutations that have potential to change the protein relative solvent accessibility based on the accpro predictor of the scratch-1d software insertion and deletion mutations alter protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility by default so that they are not included in the structure and solvent accessibility change statistics table 1 shows that the orf3a and orf8 proteins have the number of nonsynonymous mutations significantly larger than that of the synonymous mutations in contrast this ratio in proteins e m orf7b and orf10 are very small less than 1 these proteins could be targeted for vaccine and drug development as they have less variations than other proteins these findings are supported by results presented in figs fig 3  entire regions before and after the spike at position 614 are almost unchanged fig 4 presents variations of multiple proteins in addition to proteins e m orf7b and orf10 we find that proteins orf6 and orf7a are also relatively stable without a large number of variations at any particular locations protein n has 1927 nonsynonymous mutations but 1678 of them are likely to make changes in protein secondary structure making a ratio of 8708 this is considerably larger than those of protein s 442 protein m 2479 and protein e 6429 the number of solvent accessibility changes of protein s is larger than its structure changes 184 vs 164 this however is opposite in other structural proteins e 7 vs 18 m 8 vs 30 and n 37 vs 1678  the orf1ab polyprotein has 7096 aas among 6324 records deposited to the ncbi genbank database only 3726 genomes have the complete coding sequence cds of protein orf1ab with 1024 unique aa sequences this is quite a large number compared to other proteins but understandable because orf1ab is the longest protein of sars-cov-2 and thus has a large number table 2  table 2  the genbank accession numbers are presented on the left while isolate names and collected dates are on the right the numbers on top show the positions of aas in the protein and isolates are ordered by collected dates the first isolate having these deletions is usa-ca62020 record mt044258 in second row collected on 2020-01-27 in usa ca this is also the isolate having the largest number of deletions five sequentially at g82- h83- v84- m85- v86-and three at k141- s142- f143- the other patients followed were possibly infected by this first case but more data such as travel history are needed to confirm this hypothesis 18 germany 16 taiwan 9  the orf3a protein has 275 aas with its complete cds appearing in 5527 isolates 146 unique aa sequences among these 2321 sequences have no mutation or only synonymous mutations and 3206 sequences have insertion deletion or nonsynonymous mutations table 4  notably the mutation q57h occurs in 2795 sequences collected in many countries this is an emerging and active mutation which requires further investigation as the latest case of this mutation was on 2020-06-05 same as the latest collection date of the entire downloaded dataset the mutation g251v occurring in 206 sequences is also a prevalent mutation in the orf3a protein  the orf6 protein has 61 aas appearing in 5792 isolates with 25 unique aa sequences among these 5719 sequences have no mutation or only synonymous mutations and 73 sequences have insertion deletion or nonsynonymous mutations two insertion mutations occur in record mt520188 at positions -62r and -63t end of the sequence nine continual deletions occur similarly in 2 sequences mt547814 collected in hong kong on 2020-01-22 from an adult male patient 37  and mt609561 usa virginia in 2020-04 these deletions are f22- k23- v24- s25- i26- w27- n28- l29-and d30- alignment of these sequences with the reference genome is displayed in fig 6  the isolate mt547814 thus may have transmitted the virus to mt609561 but this implication needs to be corroborated by patients travel history there are 23 distinct nonsynonymous mutations and those occurring in 2 or more sequences are presented in table 5   the orf7a protein has 121 aas in length found in 5321 isolates with 34 unique aa sequences among these 5215 sequences have no mutations or only synonymous mutations while the rest orf7a there are 15 deletion mutations occurring in 2 records mt520425

a66- c67- p68- d69- g70- v71- k72- h73- v74- y75-and q76- alignment of these sequences with that of the reference genome is shown in fig 7  there are 32 distinct nonsynonymous mutations with those occurring in 2 or more sequences are reported in table 6   the orf7b protein has 43 aas with its complete cds appearing in 5175 isolates forming a set of 11 unique aa sequences there are 5151 sequences having no mutations or only synonymous mutations and 24 sequences having nonsynonymous mutations no insertion or deletion mutations are found in gene orf7b this along with a small number of nonsynonymous mutations indicate that orf7b is a stable gene distinct nonsynonymous mutations 10 of them include f19l f28y f30l s31l l32f t40i c41f c41s h42y and a43t summary of nonsynonymous mutations in gene orf7b occurring in 2 or more sequences is shown in table 7   the orf10 protein has 38 aas in length appearing in 5891 isolates with only 9 unique aa sequences among them 5872 sequences have no mutation or only synonymous mutations and the rest 19 sequences have nonsynonymous mutations no insertion and deletion mutations are found in gene orf10 similar to orf7b this is a stable gene there are 8 distinct nonsynonymous mutations including i4l a8v s23f r24l r24c a28v d31y and v33i those occurring in 2 sequences or more are presented in table 9  the virus transmission may have happened between these two isolates but this needs further investigation alignment of these sequences is shown in fig 9  the number of nonsynonymous mutations in gene s is 3711 with 240 distinct mutations mutations that occur in 10 or more cases are reported in table 10  the number of synonymous mutations is 670 making a ratio between nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutations at 554 among the nonsynonymous mutations mutation d614g is extremely common as it happens in 3089 sequences majorly collected in usa 2340 india 210 and australia 132 the first collected date of the d614g mutation cannot be identified precisely because some sequences deposited to the ncbi genbank did not record the full date details the current data show that either of the following sequences which have the d614g mutation was first collected mt326173 in usa in 2020 or mt270104 mt270105 mt270108 and mt270109 all in germany bavaria in 2020-01 or mt503006 in thailand on 2020-01-04 it is however important to note that the first patient having the d614g mutation and hisher location may never be known because genome of that patient might not be sequenced and reported therefore information reported here can support for further investigation our statistics show that among 4434 sequences of the s protein 3089 sequences have the mutation d614g taking 6967 this number has considerably increased compared to 315 in the previous analysis in 20 on a dataset downloaded on 2020-03-22 on the other hand there are 37 a829t mutations that all occur in thailand the first case of this mutation was collected on 2020-01-23 and its latest case was on 2020-04-07 this may indicate that the first case had probably transmitted to other cases having the same mutation a829t in thailand alternatively mutations h146y 24 cases v483a 11 cases e554d 14 cases p681l 16 cases and s939f 11 cases all occur only in usa or mutation l8v 4 cases occurs only in hong kong refer to the attached spreadsheet the latest date in tables 2-15 may be used to infer which mutations are inactive or still active for example in gene s table 10  the latest date of d614g was on 2020-06-05 same as the latest collection date of the entire dataset that indicates that this mutation is still active the latest date of p681l was on 2020-04-03 indicating that this mutation may no longer occur this kind of information may be useful for further research on vaccine and drug development as ongoing changes of the viral proteins need to be focused and addressed we identify the rbd region within the residue range arg319-phe541 of protein s based on a study in 36  in the rbd region only the number of nonsynonymous mutations is 53 and that of synonymous is 46 making a ratio of 115 this is much smaller than the ratio of 554 for the entire gene s suggesting that the rbd region may have been optimized for binding to a receptor of a host cell this is complemented by fig 9 showing all deletion mutations in gene s being outside the rbd region note that the difference of these ratios is partly due to the large number of d614g mutations 3 089  which is outside the rbd region table 11 summarizes nonsynonymous mutations in the rbd region occurring in 2 or more sequences notable mutation in this region is v483a occurring in 11 isolates all collected in usa the first and latest collected dates of these isolates were respectively 2020-03-05 and 2020-04-05 suggesting that the first isolate may have spread to others having the same mutation v483a likewise the mutation g476s occurs in 6 isolates all collected in usa wa from 2020-03-10 to 2020-03-25 alternatively the mutation y453f occurs in 5 sequences all in netherlands but the first collected date was on 2020-04-25 and the latest collected date was on 2020-04-29 these dates are too close indicating that all the reported y453f cases may have been infected from another case whose genome had not been sequenced and reported to the ncbi genbank it is important to note that all the transmission implications need further investigation with more data from other aspects such as travel history physical contacts and so on in for the entire protein s 134 nonsynonymous mutations 48 unique have both structure and solvent accessibility change potentials these mutations occurring in 2 or more sequences are reported in table 12  mutation h146y occurs in 24 cases and mutation p681l occurs in 16 cases which are all collected in usa the most common mutation d614g does not have the potential to change either protein secondary structure or relative solvent accessibility the envelope protein e has 75 aas found in 5852 genbank records with 15 unique aa sequences among them 5824 sequences have no mutation or only synonymous mutations while 28 sequences have nonsynonymous mutations gene e is thus relatively stable and could be targeted for vaccine and drug development this is supported by the fact that no insertion or deletion mutations are found within gene e there are 14 distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene e and those occur in 2 or more sequences are presented in table 13  five distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene e have protein structure change potential s68c s68f p71l d72y and l73f alternatively 4 distinct mutations have potential to change relative solvent accessibility l37h l37r d72y and l73f therefore d72y and l73f are two mutations in gene e that have a potential to change both protein structure and solvent accessibility table 12  gene s -nonsynonymous mutations that have both structure and solvent accessibility

appropriate approaches to respond to and control the pandemic this paper has reported all point mutations of sars-cov-2 since the viruss first genomes were obtained in december 2019 a sars-cov-2 mutation database is built using a large number of genome sequences 6324 obtained across 45 countries this database can enable scientists to monitor the evolution and spread of the virus although the use of these data needs to be corroborated with patients clinical data and travel history for substantiated confirmations we also predict the secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility of the virus proteins to evaluate whether the detected mutations have a potential to change the virus characteristics these protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility change potentials are predicted results based on deep learning recurrent neural networks which need to be experimentally verified they however provide important insights about the virus and prompt further experimental biochemistry and molecular biology research into the genomic regions of these mutations among 3089 d614g mutations our prediction results show that none of these mutations is likely to make changes in the protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility in addition we have shown regions of the sars-cov-2 genomes that have small variations such as those coding for proteins e m orf6

replicates in the brain to titers at least as high as wild type and causes acute encephalitis similar to wild type this virus causes a minimal level of demyelination and only at very high levels of virus inoculation thus acute encephalitis is not sufficient for the induction of demyelination by mhv-a59 analysis of mutants isolated at earlier times from the same persistently infected glial cell culture as c12 as well as mutants isolated from a second independent culture of persistently infected glial cells suggests that both the weakly demyelinating and the weakly hepatotropic phenotypes of

analyzed for the ability under materials and methods induced by wild type and c12 viruses as a function of dose of virus inoculated to induce demyelination these results are shown in fig  3 and summarized in table 2  the c3 mutant was able figure 2 shows these results for wild type mhv-a59 the amount of demyelination was approximately linear to induce demyelination with the same efficiency

correlating with the loss of hepatotropism also coincides with the development of the high levels of virus inoculated thus encephalitis does not necessarily lead to demyelination several other labs

reverse genetics system devised for coronaviruses at a time when it was not clear whether the construction of fulllength infectious cdna clones would become possible in its current state targeted rna recombination offers a versatile and powerful method for the site-directed mutagenesis of the downstream third of the coronavirus genome which encodes all the viral structural proteins the development of this system is described with an emphasis on recent improvements and multiple applications of this technique to the study of coronavirus molecular biology and pathogenesis are reviewed additionally the relative strengths and limitations of targeted rna recombination and infectious cdna systems are contrasted ps masters  pjm rottier 136 ps masters  pjm rottier  1 introduction targeted rna recombination was developed to address the need for a reverse genetic system for coronaviruses at a time when it was uncertain whether the construction of full-length infectious cdna clones was technically feasible or indeed even possible as detailed elsewhere in this volume this goal has now been realized largely through the tenacity and ingenuity of a handful of investigators concurrently the ensuing decade since its origination has allowed targeted recombination to evolve into a productive methodology that across the boundaries of multiple laboratories and viral species has enabled coronavirus studies to take advantage of the opportunities offered by reverse genetics in this chapter we begin with a brief background on the prominence of recombination in coronavirus rna synthesis and then detail how this property has been exploited for the purposes of site-directed mutagenesis of the coronavirus genome we describe the scientific problems to which targeted recombination has been successfully applied and finally we comment on the future prospects for this technique throughout our discussion emphasis is placed on new developments in the field since the last time this subject was reviewed masters 1999  rna recombination is a well-established phenomenon among animal plant and bacterial rna viruses reviewed in lai 1992 nagy and simon 1997  as a mechanism of genetic exchange it provides these viruses with a powerful evolutionary attribute recombination is concomitant with viral rna replication the consensus model for its occurrence is that the viral rna polymerase with a nascent rna strand attached to it dissociates from its template and resumes rna synthesis after it has bound elsewhere to the same or to another template this copy-choice or template-switching mechanism was originally established for polioviruses kirkegaard and baltimore 1986  the viral species for which rna recombination was first demonstrated ledinko 1963  but it seems to be generally applicable homologous rna recombination takes place when there is a switch of templates between regions of high sequence similarity this particular form of recombination had only been observed for-and was thus be-lieved to be restricted to-positive-strand rna viruses but it has recently also been demonstrated for a minus-strand rna virus plyusnin et al 2002  homologous rna recombination occurs at a remarkably high rate among coronaviruses lai 1992 lai  1996  their huge genome size and particular mode of replication employing a discontinuous mode of transcription may favor polymerase template switching brian and spaan 1996  accordingly the phenomenon also has been observed for other nidoviruses particularly the arteriviruses li et al 1999 yuan et al 1999 van vugt et al 2001  experimental evidence for rna recombination in coronaviruses has rapidly accumulated ever since its first description in the mid-1980s lai et al 1985  essentially all of the early work was done with mouse hepatitis virus mhv by taking skillful advantage of the availability of distinctive natural viral strains and classic mutants generated in the laboratory initially through the analysis of progeny obtained from coinfection of culture cells or mouse brains with different mhv variants and application of different selection principles eg temperature sensitivity cell fusion ability sensitivity to neutralization by specific antibodies many of the fundamental features of coronavirus recombination were elucidated lai et al 1985 keck et al 1987 keck et al  1988a makino et al 1987  sequence analyses revealed that recombination can happen virtually anywhere along the genome but that particular virus combinations show preferred crossover regions probably owing to selective pressure banner et al 1990  many mhv recombinants were found to have multiple crossovers consistent with an exceptionally high frequency of recombination the overall frequency per passage was estimated at approximately 1 per 1300 nucleotides or 25 over the entire genome by long-range mapping using temperature-sensitive mutants baric et al 1990  similar studies subsequently demonstrated that within a relatively short interval the recombination frequency is uniform banner and lai 1991 but it increases progressively from the 5 0 to the 3 0 end of the mhv genome presumably because of participation of subgenomic sg rnas fu and baric 1994  although homologous rna recombination has been less extensively studied in other viral species the experimental demonstration of this phenomenon has not been limited to the group 2 coronavirus mhv it has been shown as well for the group 3 coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv kottier et al 1995 and the group 1 coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev snchez et al 1999  for the former by coinfection of viruses into embryonated eggs and for the latter by electroporation of defective rna into infected cells in tissue culture recombination of coronaviruses appears to be a process of significant importance in the wild its occurrence has been shown to contribute to the natural evolution of ibv this highly contagious virus comprises many different serotypes and new ones emerge regularly with the result that these viruses escape from host immunity and cause new outbreaks although many of the new variants arise by genetic drift as a result of subtle mutations in the spike protein s gene similar to the changes that lead to antigenic drift in influenza viruses new serotypes apparently also originate from genetic exchange of s gene sequences between different viruses through homologous rna recombination kusters et al 1990 cavanagh et al 1990 wang et al 1993 jia et al 1995  of considerable impact on these evolutionary processes is the veterinary practice of vaccination large-scale application of combinations of live attenuated vaccine viruses drastically enhances the opportunities for recombination the identification of vaccine-derived sequences in field isolates is therefore not surprising kusters et al 1990 wang et al 1993 lee and jackwood 2001  rather these events actually seem to occur at high frequency and are not restricted to the s gene region as attested by the complex genetic makeup of ibv strains that carry the footprints of multiple independent recombinations jia et al 1995 lee and jackwood 2000  homologous rna recombination also plays an important role in the evolution of feline coronaviruses these viruses fall into two serotypes with type i viruses being the most prevalent unlike type i viruses the type ii viruses cross-react with canine coronavirus ccov in virus neutralization assays and sequence analysis of their s genes indeed confirms this relatedness serotype ii viruses appear to be derived from recombination between type i feline coronaviruses and ccov motokawa et al 1995 vennema et al 1995 herrewegh et al 1995  detailed analyses of two type ii strains revealed that each actually resulted from double recombination with crossover points located both upstream and downstream of the s gene herrewegh et al 1998  importantly all of the crossover points were unique and subsequent sequencing of the 3 0 genomic region of two additional type ii strains showed that the template switches in this region had occurred at different sites in all four viruses two each in the envelope protein e and the membrane protein m genes vennema 1999  obviously these viruses must have arisen from independent recombination events although it is not known in which host species the coinfection of feline and canine coronaviruses takes place these observations suggest that such occurrences are not overly rare more generally rna recombination is also believed to have been instrumental in the emergence of the three coronavirus groups viruses from these groups characteristically differ in the identities and genomic locations of their nonessential genes these group-specific genes are presumed to have been acquired by recombination in this case nonhomologous with cellular or heterologous viral rnas a case in point is the hemagglutinin-esterase he gene found in several group 2 coronaviruses as well as in toroviruses this gene was presumably derived from recombination between an ancestral coronavirus and influenza c virus as is suggested by its remarkable sequence similarity to the corresponding orthomyxoviral he gene luytjes et al 1988  apart from stillundefined roles in interactions with their respective hosts de haan et al 2002a  the functions and possible origins of the other group-specific genes remain elusive targeted rna recombination methodology and technical issues targeted rna recombination was devised as a means of introducing specified changes into the coronavirus genome through recombination between a donor synthetic rna and a recipient parent virus possessing some characteristic that allows it to be counterselected the genomic changes to be introduced are first generated in a cdna transcription vector and donor rna is transcribed in vitro from this plasmid after rna recombination in infected cells viral progeny bearing the desired alterations are selected on the basis of their possession of a phenotypic property not found in the original recipient virus the earliest scheme for targeted rna recombination came about by the fortunate confluence of a number of separate discoveries first as outlined in the previous section an abundance of experimental work primarily with mhv had demonstrated that rna recombination is a frequent event in the coronavirus infectious cycle second it had recently been shown that each coronavirus sgrna possesses a negative-strand counterpart sethna et al 1989  although the original proposal that sgrnas function as replicons has not proved correct this key finding made clear that the positive-strand sgrnas serve as substrates for the viral polymerase thus rendering them likely participants in polymerase-mediated recombination finally an mhv mutant was found that had the ideal properties for the recipient parent virus this mutant alb4 was among a collection of classic random mutants isolated on the basis of production of an atypical cytopathic effect at the nonpermissive temperature 39c sturman et al 1987  alb4 is temperature sensitive but it is not an absolute conditional-lethal mutant in that it produces plaques at the nonpermissive temperature that are tiny by comparison with the wild type additionally virions of alb4 are thermolabile exhibiting a drop in infectious titer of two to three orders of magnitude when held at the nonpermissive temperature for 24 h a treatment that only minimally affects the viability of the wild type the lesion in alb4 was found to reside in the nucleocapsid n gene the gene closest to the 3 0 untranslated region 3 0 utr of the genome and consists of an 87-nt in frame deletion koetzner et al 1992  that removes a 29-amino acid linker connecting two functional domains of the n protein parker and masters 1990  the experiment establishing the principle of targeted rna recombination then was carried out by cotransfection of mouse cells with the purified genome of alb4 and a synthetic copy of sgrna7 which is the smallest of the mhv sgrnas and serves as the mrna for n protein  fig 1  koetzner et al 1992  the synthetic donor rna contained the wild-type undeleted version of the n gene and was tagged with a presumed nondeleterious 5-nt insertion in the 3 0 utr the precarious nature of this latter assumption was only revealed years later when it was found that the insertion had been made in a mutable loop of an rna secondary structure that is absolutely essential for mhv replication hsue and masters 1997  the viral progeny resulting from the cotransfection were subjected to a heat-killing step so as to greatly reduce the background of alb4 parent virus and candidate recombinants were identified as viruses forming large ie wild-type sized plaques at the nonpermissive temperature the presence in the putative recombinants of both the region that is deleted in alb4 and the 5-nt tag was verified by size or restriction fragment polymorphisms in rt-pcr products from genomic rna that had been isolated from purified virions additionally the 5-nt tag which is present in neither wild-type mhv nor the alb4 mutant was demonstrated by direct sequencing of genomic rna of the recombinants these viruses were thus the first engineered site-specific mutants of a member of the coronavirus family fig 1  earliest implementation of targeted rna recombination genomic rna grna from the alb4 mutant and synthetic donor rna were cotransfected into cells the donor rna contained the wild-type n gene including the 87-nt region that is deleted in alb4 black rectangle and was also tagged with a 5-nt insertion in the 3 0 utr after harvest of progeny virus the alb4 parent was selectively killed by heat treatment and recombinants were identified as viruses forming large wild-type size plaques at the nonpermissive temperature the initial demonstration of targeted rna recombination was soon followed by a report of the incorporation of genetic markers into the mhv genome by using a defective interfering di rna midi-c as the donor rna  fig 2  van der most et al 1992  in this case a coding-silent marker tagging the region of the alb4 n gene deletion was successfully transferred from the di rna to alb4 recipient virus additionally it was shown that recombinants bearing midi-c-derived markers that had been transduced into gene 1 of wild-type mhv could be isolated by screening without any prior selection most importantly the efficiency of obtaining recombinants with this di rna as the donor appeared to shown at the top of each panel is the genome from which the donor rnas are derived brackets indicate fragments of full-length genes be significantly higher than had been achieved with sgrna7 as the donor coronavirus di rnas are parasitic elements that arise through the accumulation of extensive deletions which eliminate most of the coding capacity of the genome while retaining cis-acting elements essential for viral polymerase recognition they are therefore not independently viable but they replicate by feeding into the rna synthesis machinery provided by a helper virus in an attempt to systematically optimize the performance of targeted recombination the efficiencies of the two types of donor rna were directly compared masters et al 1994  for this purpose a nonnatural mhv di rna designated pb36 rna was constructed to contain the entire n gene mimicking the composition of a well-characterized naturally arising di rna of bovine coronavirus bcov chang et al 1994  it was found that this donor di rna replicated abundantly and consistently yielded targeted recombinants with alb4 at an efficiency on the order of 10 2  some two to three orders of magnitude greater than that obtained with sgrna7 donor rna this meant that candidate large plaque recombinants could generally be identified directly against the background of small plaques formed by the alb4 parent without the need for a heat-killing counterselection step because the mechanistic details of rna recombination remain to be unraveled it has not yet been resolved whether the increased donor efficiency of di rnas results from their replicative competence or from some other intrinsic property it is possible that the critical feature of di rnas is not their ability to replicate per se but rather that they possess some sequence or structural element that brings about their localization to the rna synthesis compartment or that facilitates their alignment with homologous regions of the acceptor genome template despite our not understanding precisely why di rnas work so well it was nevertheless straightforward to design additional donor rnas based on the relatively simple composition of pb36 rna which comprises only the 5 0 -and 3 0 -terminal segments from the mhv genome connected by a short heterologous linker masters et al 1994  the inclusion of more material from the 3 0 end of the genome resulted in progressively larger plasmid vectors for donor rnas-pp17 fischer et al 1997a  pfv1 fischer et al 1997b  and pmh54 kuo et al 2000 fig 2 -which were collectively capable of transducing mutations into any of the genes downstream of gene 1 the viral replicase gene the availability of these larger donor rnas termed pseudo-di rnas because it has never been directly determined whether they are replication competent consequently places all of the mhv structural genes within the reach of the targeted recombination method separately a similar principle was applied to a different coronavirus species tgev by the insertion of the s protein gene into a naturally occurring di rna of that virus mndez et al 1996  however in this case the donor rna m54-sc11 fig 2  was not completely colinear with the 3 0 end of the recipient genome and thus the formation of the recombinants that were isolated was dependent upon two crossover events one upstream and one downstream of the targeted region snchez et al 1999  work has also been done toward using a modified naturally occurring di rna of ibv in targeted rna recombination but the recovery of viable recombinants from this system has not yet been reported neuman et al 2001  although the alb4 mutant was invaluable in moving coronavirus genetics from classic to molecular capabilities a fundamental limitation of the scheme described above is that selection against alb4 makes sense only if the mutant being sought is more fit than alb4 at the nonpermissive temperature this precondition still allows the selection of a wide variety of mutants but it places a restriction on the range of problems to which a genetic system could potentially be applied two studies made use of alternative strategies to circumvent this fitness precondition in one study an rt-pcr-based screen of large pools of candidate recombinant plaques was employed to identify clustered charged-to-alanine mutations made in the e gene fischer et al 1998  the fact that the resulting e protein mutants were temperature sensitive and thermolabile explained why they could not be isolated by a heat-killing selection a second means around the fitness requirement was to carry out a different type of selection in this case neutralization with monoclonal antibodies specific for the s protein of mhv strain a59 the strain to which alb4 belongs was used to obtain recombinants that had incorporated the s gene of mhv strain 4 phillips et al 1999  however both of these alternatives had disadvantages mutant identification by screening is extremely labor intensive and of uncertain efficiency and strain-specific monoclonal antibody selection is applicable only under special circumstances superseding these two particular exceptions a very powerful positive selection strategy was enabled by the creation of an interspecies chimeric mutant of mhv in which the ectodomain of the s protein was replaced with its counterpart from feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv kuo et al 2000  this substitution had its foundation in work done with viruslike particles vlps which had suggested that the determinants for functional s protein incorporation into virions reside solely in the transmembrane domain and the endodomain of the molecule  because both mhv and fipv are stringently species specific in tissue culture the interspecies chimeric mutant named fmhv was readily obtained by a targeted rna recombination experiment that selected for a virus that had acquired the ability to grow in feline cells it soon became apparent that the inverse of this selection would provide significantly greater flexibility in the construction of mhv mutants than the alb4-based targeted recombination scheme the use of fmhv as the recipient virus with donor rna transcribed from a pmh54-derived vector which would restore the region encoding the mhv s gene ectodomain should in principle allow the selection of recombinants harboring any nonlethal mhv mutation fig 3 top panel  no matter how fragile its phenotype the constructed mutant should be identifiable on the basis of its having regained the ability to grow in murine cells in contrast to the fmhv parent which can only grow in feline cells the feasibility and utility of this strategy have now been proven repeatedly in multiple laboratories the strength of the host range-based selection has been most dramatically demonstrated by its ability to recover a mutant with a two-residue truncation of the carboxy terminus of the m protein kuo and masters 2002  and a mutant with the critical e gene entirely deleted kuo and masters 2003  both of these mutants are severely impaired forming tiny plaques at all temperatures and yielding infectious titers that are at most orders of magnitude lower than those of the wild type in the initial selection of these and a number of other highly defective mutants the recombinants being sought were identified as tiny plaques among a mixture of tiny and wild-type-sized plaques masters 2002 2003  analysis of the latter showed that they were reconstructed wildtype viruses which had arisen via a second crossover event occurring downstream of the restored mhv s gene but upstream of the mutation of interest fig 3 top panel  although double crossovers occur with lower frequency than a single crossover they can constitute a significant fraction of the initial recombinants in cases in which the wild type has a marked growth advantage over the constructed mutant to preclude the possibility of the second crossover event a variant of fmhv designated fmhvv2 has been constructed in which the gene order downstream of the s gene has been rearranged fig 3 middle panel  the use of fmhvv2 eliminates the background of progeny recombinants generated fig 3  host range-based selection top panel selection strategy with the interspecies chimeric coronavirus fmhv which contains the portion of the s gene encoding the ectodomain of the spike protein of fipv shaded rectangle but is otherwise identical to mhv fmhv is able to grow in feline cells but cannot grow in murine cells in targeted recombination with donor rna that restores the mhv s ectodomain a single crossover solid line within the he gene can generate a recombinant that has reacquired the ability to grow in murine cells and has also incorporated an engi-by second crossovers and it is of particular utility in the recovery of unselected markers that are debilitating or that are located far downstream of the s gene goebel et al 2004  in addition to depth the host range-based selection system has been shown to have breadth the fmhv structural genes have been incorporated into the jhm strain of mhv resulting in fmhv-jhm fig 3  middle panel ontiveros et al 2001  this chimeric virus in conjunction with the appropriate jhm strain counterpart of the pmh54 vector has been used to construct site-directed mutants in mhv-jhm thereby providing proof of principle for the applicability of this system to mhv strains other than strain a59 a more far-reaching extension of the method has been achieved by the construction of mfipv an interspecies chimeric mutant of fipv in which the ectodomain of the s protein has been replaced with that of mhv haijema et al 2003  this virus which as expected has a host cell species permissivity exactly the converse of that of fmhv provides the starting point for construction of site-directed mutations in the structural and nonstructural genes of fipv fig 3  bottom panel these results establish host range-based selection as a general blueprint for the carrying out of reverse genetics in all coronaviruses or at least in those that exhibit some level of host range restriction in tissue culture the impact of reverse genetic systems on progress in virology has been overwhelmingly demonstrated for most families of viruses over the last two decades much to the frustration of many a coronavirologist the new availability of multiple systems for engineering coronaviral genomes suddenly provides these investigators with unexpected opportunities requiring choices to be made these choices will be guided by the neered mutation star a potential second crossover broken line would regenerate a wild-type recombinant lacking the mutation middle panel variant interspecies recipient viruses fmhvv2 which greatly reduces

fmhv scheme top panel t particular research question and by the practical and theoretical limitations of the various engineering systems because of the restrictions inherent in its selection principle targeted rna recombination in its present format will retain its greatest value in the study and manipulation of functions specified by the genomic regions downstream of the polymerase gene the vast potential of this technology for coronavirus research can perhaps best be envisaged just by looking back at the first ten years of its existence what follows is a brief survey of important contributions that the targeted recombination approach has made in the different areas of its application unless otherwise specified the work discussed refers to mhv by their nature the earliest versions of the targeted recombination method revolved around the n gene they allowed the mapping of the extreme thermolability of virions of mhv-a59 mutants alb4 and alb1 to a deletion koetzner et al 1992 and to a point mutation masters et al 1994  respectively in this gene by an analysis of a panel of independently isolated revertant viruses this thermolability could for alb4 subsequently be attributed to a disturbed rna binding capacity of the n protein by the use of targeted recombination critical evidence was obtained linking the restoration of the wild-type phenotype to a single reverting amino acid mutation different for each revertant in a domain of the n protein to which rna binding had been previously mapped peng et al 1995a  it was therefore somewhat surprising that major parts of this domain as well as the segment that is deleted in alb4 could be exchanged without penalty by the corresponding domain of the bcov n protein peng et al 1995b  the resulting mhv-bcov chimeric viruses were viable and thermally stable in contrast for other regions of the n protein such as the terminal domains interspecies exchange was not tolerated presumably because these regions are involved in protein-protein interactions that are specific for each virus interactions between m molecules are thought to provide the major force for the assembly of the coronavirus envelope rottier 1995 vennema et al 1996  in a mutational study investigating the primary structural requirements of the m protein for assembly of vlps from coexpressed m and e proteins it was found that stringent structural conditions must be satisfied for envelope formation in particular the extreme carboxy terminus of m was shown to be crucial in this system de haan et al 1998  the mere deletion of the terminal residue md1 almost completely abolished assembly whereas an m protein mutant additionally lacking the penultimate residue md2 was entirely assembly incompetent by contrast when these deletions and other mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain were transferred to the mhv genome by targeted recombination the resulting effects were generally much less severe or were even absent the md1 viral mutant for instance had no detectable defect apparently in the context of the complete virion changes that are devastating in the vlp system can be accommodated by other stabilizing interactions most likely between the envelope and the nucleocapsid although the md2 viral mutant could not be identified in this study and was thus considered nonviable de haan et al 1998  the power of the host range-based selection system later enabled its isolation kuo and masters 2002  the md2 virus formed tiny plaques in tissue culture and grew extremely poorly and on passage revertants with strongly improved growth properties rapidly emerged genetic analysis of a large number of second-site revertants combined with the targeted reintroduction of some of the reverting mutations back into the md2 mutant genome identified residues both in the m protein and in the n protein that could compensate for the two-residue deletion this provided compelling evidence for a structural interaction between the carboxy termini of these two proteins in mhv despite its minute abundance in virions the e protein is a critical factor in the assembly of coronaviruses its function however is still unresolved to study the role of e clustered charged-to-alanine mutations were introduced into the protein through targeted recombination fischer et al 1998  three viable mutant viruses were obtained two of which were temperature sensitive whereas the third had a wild-type phenotype both temperature-sensitive mutants were markedly thermolabile when grown at the permissive temperature when virions of one of these e mutants were viewed by electron microscopy particles with strikingly aberrant shapes were observed these data indicated an important role for the e protein in virion morphogenesis and stability remarkably however it has recently become clear that this role is not essential again because of the power of the host range-based selection system of targeted recombination it has been possible to isolate a mutant of mhv from which the e gene is entirely deleted kuo and masters 2003 de haan and rottier unpublished results  although the de mutant produces tiny plaques with an unusual morphology has a slow growth rate and grows to low infectious titer it is nevertheless completely viable curiously the e protein appears to be an absolute requirement for the group 1 coronavirus tgev growth of tgev from which the e gene has been deleted is essentially dependent on in trans complementation by expressed e protein curtis et al 2002 ortego et al 2002  because all intergenic regions including their associated transcriptionregulating sequences trss as well as the 3 0 utr are accessible for manipulation by targeted rna recombination this methodology allows the study of many questions related to viral replication and transcription an initial foray in this direction sought to define functionally equivalent segments of the 3 0 utrs of mhv and bcov this led to the identification of a conserved bulged stem-loop secondary structure at the upstream end of the 3 0 utr adjacent to the stop codon of the n gene hsue and masters 1997  the stem-loop was shown to be essential for virus viability as well as for di rna replication more recent work hsue et al 2000 goebel et al 2004  using mutational analysis combined with chemical and enzymatic probing has refined the picture of this structure and has delineated its relationship with a downstream and partially overlapping rna pseudoknot that was first discovered in bcov williams et al 1999  the mutually exclusive nature of the stemloop and the pseudoknot suggests that they are components of a molecular switch functioning to mediate some event during rna synthesis coronaviruses have a genome organization in which the order of the essential genes 5 0 -polymerase-s-e-m-n-3 0  is strictly conserved despite the high frequency of rna recombination of these viruses to find out whether this fixed gene order is in some way a vital property deliberate rearrangements were introduced into the viral genome through targeted recombination all attempted gene rearrangements were found to be tolerated generally with surprisingly little effect on the growth characteristics of the recombinant viruses in cell culture or for one virus tested in the mouse host de haan et al 2002b  the factors that determine the relative efficiencies of synthesis of coronavirus sgrnas are as yet poorly understood evidence indicates that the identity of the trs its sequence context and its genomic position can all contribute to the process the fortuitous effect of one or more of three nucleotide changes introduced into a donor vector for targeted recombination pmh54 fig 2  to create a convenient restriction site upstream of the gene 4 trs illustrates the importance of the trs sequence context ontiveros et al 2001 de haan et al 2002a  for unknown rea-sons this modification led to a dramatic at least sevenfold upregulation of sgrna4 synthesis other examples of unexpected context effects were observed in some genomically rearranged viruses de haan et al 2002b  for instance relocation of the gene 4-5ae-m cluster to a location between the polymerase and s genes mutant mhv-emsmn resulted in a strong increase in the level of synthesis of the now largest sgrna by comparison with its wild-type counterpart the opposite was observed after relocation of the m gene to a position immediately downstream of the s gene mutant mhv-smen the sgrna specifying the m protein was hardly detectable obviously much more systematic work will need to be done to provide clear insights into these complex issues to explore other questions related to coronavirus rna synthesis targeted rna recombination has also been employed for the insertion of a new transcription unit into the mhv genome hsue and masters 1999  as well as for the embedding of a high-affinity binding site for a putative host transcriptional factor shen and masters 2001  the ability to study the effect of targeted mutations in the viral genome on the course of a natural infection represents an essential tool with which to rigorously address the interplay between host and virus this is illustrated most impressively by a series of studies on the role of the mhv s protein in viral pathogenesis modifications ranging from single amino acid changes to complete spike replacements were applied in the first category the simple substitution q159l in the receptor binding domain of mhv-a59 s protein significantly reduced viral virulence replication in the liver and consequently the extent of viral hepatitis were strongly decreased leparc-goffart et al 1998  similarly amino acid substitutions at the s1s2 cleavage site indicated that efficient cleavage and cell-cell fusion are not necessary for virulence hingley et al 2002  in the category of large-scale modifications the replacement of the entire s gene of mhv-a59 a moderately neurovirulent virus by that of mhv-4 which is highly neurovirulent resulted in a chimeric virus with dramatically increased neurovirulence although replication in the brain was not elevated viral antigen staining and inflammation in the central nervous system were increased phillips et al 1999  the acquired spike apparently conveys to the chimeric virus most of the pathogenic properties of its cognate virus this interpretation was confirmed in an analogous exchange involving the mhv-2 s gene in this case the non-demy-elinating phenotype of the latter virus was passed on to mhv-a59 a demyelinating strain das sarma et al 2000  still further support for the role of s as the primary determinant of pathogenicity was provided by an analysis of the chimeric viruses for their ability to induce hepatitis after intrahepatic inoculation navas et al 2001  the level of replication in the liver and the extent of hepatocellular damage paralleled those of the virus from which the spike had been obtained that is mhv-a59 carrying an mhv-4 mhv-a59 or mhv-2 spike exhibited low moderate or high replication and pathology respectively finally a series of chimeric viruses containing intramolecularly recombined mhv-4mhv-a59 s genes in the mhv-a59 background was tested to further explore the determinants of neurovirulence within the mhv-4 spike phillips et al 2001 phillips et al  2002  reciprocal exchanges of the s1 and s2 subunits and of parts of the hypervariable region of s1 yielded viruses that replicated well in vitro but were generally severely attenuated in mice these results suggest that such modifications disturb interactions within the s protein that are important for efficient infection in the mouse brain a critical role of the s protein in pathogenesis was also demonstrated for tgev by replacement through targeted recombination of most of the s gene of a respiratory tgev isolate by that of a virus with enteric tropism recombinants were obtained that had acquired the latter property snchez et al 1999  these recombinant viruses thereby also gained the ability to replicate to high titers in the porcine enteric tract as well as the marked virulence that is the distinguishing trait of the enteropathogenic parent virus in addition to the genes encoding the polymerase and canonical structural proteins coronaviruses have a number of other genes forming characteristic sets in each coronavirus group the functions of which are as yet unknown none of these genes is essential for replication as was demonstrated by targeted recombination for mhv fischer et al 1997a ontiveros et al 2001 de haan et al 2002a  and for fipv haijema et al 2003  targeted inactivation of gene 4 in mhv-jhm did not affect the virulence of this virus whether it was inoculated intracranially or intranasally nor were the pathological effects in the central nervous system any different from those of the wild type ontiveros et al 2001  more drastic genetic changes of group-specific genes in the mhv-a59 background however were clearly attenuating in this situation viruses were constructed deleting genes 4 and 5a genes 2a and he or all four genes the latter deletions creating a minimal coronavirus removal of genes 4 and 5a but not that of genes 2a and he reduced viral growth in cell culture slightly yet significantly in intracranially inoculated mice however the virulence of all three deletion mutants was clearly reduced de haan et al 2002a  for fipv the deletion of the group-specific genes 3a 3b and 3c or genes 7a and 7b did not substantially influence in vitro growth properties in contrast the minimal virus lacking all five of these genes was strongly impaired the oronasal inoculation of cats with these deletion viruses at a dose confirmed to be lethal for wild-type fipv remained without clinical consequences that the animals had actually been infected was clear from their development of virus-neutralizing antibodies haijema et al 2003  these deletion studies suggest that the nonessential genes encode functions important for host-virus interactions the technology of targeted recombination has already displayed a number of features that will be essential for the development of coronaviruses as vectors for vaccination and therapy one is the capability of rendering these viruses avirulent by the deletion of particular genes as demonstrated for mhv and fipv in the latter case viruses lacking either the 3abc or the 7ab gene cluster were indeed shown to serve as live-attenuated vaccine candidates because cats infected with these mutants were protected against subsequent challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of virulent fipv haijema et al 2003  second the ability to genetically rearrange coronavirus genomes provides a critical safety asset because it will allow the construction of vaccine or vector viruses that because of judiciously modified gene orders should have vanishingly small probabilities of generating viable progeny through recombination with coronaviruses in the wild third the potential to retarget coronaviruses by modification of their s proteins on which the current host range selection system for recombinant viruses is also based constitutes another important feature that might be further developed to enable the directing of vectors to predefined cellular surface antigens finally for their use both as vectors and as carrier vaccines the demonstrated ability of coronaviruses to incorporate and express foreign genes is obviously essential green fluorescent protein gfp was the first nonviral protein to be expressed by a coronavirus fischer et al 1997b  the recombinant mhv containing the gfp gene inserted in place of gene 4 grew as well as the wild type did but its level of gfp expression was poor a slightly different construct containing the enhanced gfp gene again replacing gene 4 but also in the context of the upregulated trs4 of pmh54 yielded a virus that replicated as well as wild-type virus both in vitro and in the mouse central nervous system das sarma et al 2002  this virus produced fluorescence during infection in vitro and in mouse brain and gfp expression was stably maintained through at least six passages in tissue culture in another study luciferase gene expression cassettes were inserted at various positions in the mhv genome whereas the renilla luciferase gene remained stable over eight passages irrespective of its location the firefly luciferase gene was lost quite rapidly as a result of the acquisition of deletions luciferase expression levels appeared to increase when the gene was positioned closer to the 3 0 end of the genome de haan et al 2003  moreover the simultaneous synthesis of both luciferase activities from a single engineered virus demonstrated the potential for the use of coronaviruses as multivalent expression vectors within the span of nearly a decade targeted recombination has established itself as a powerful and versatile technique for the reverse genetics of the 3 0 third of the coronavirus genome which encompasses the region encoding all of the structural genes the past two years however have seen the opening of a new frontier in coronavirus reverse genetics with reports of the assembly of infectious cdnas for tgev almazn et al 2000 yount et al 2000  hcov-229e  ibv casais et al 2001  mhv  and sars-cov yount et al 2003  these recent developments raise the question of whether targeted rna recombination will retain interest only as an historic relic we think that this is unlikely to be the case it is more probable that each reverse genetic system will have its own specific advantages under a particular set of experimental circumstances at this moment one can only tentatively comment on the relative strengths and limitations of targeted rna recombination and infectious cdnas for coronavirus reverse genetics the targeted recombination system is at a fairly mature stage of development by contrast work with the infectious clone systems is sufficiently early in exploring their potentiality that it is not clear how hardy or manipulable these systems may become the capability of paramount value that is provided by the infectious clones no matter what the burden in experimental labor is access to gene 1 the capacity to site-specifically mutagenize the exceedingly large viral rna polymerase gene will undoubtedly play a major role in the acquisition of an understanding of the workings of this complex machinery except for its periphery gene 1 is effectively out of the range of targeted rna recombination because the construction of donor rna vectors entering this region is hindered by precisely the same technical problems that made the assembly of infectious cdnas so formidable a task a second unique characteristic of the infectious clones is their potential to provide the means by which the passage zero situation can be examined for intentionally lethal mutant constructs this property has been elegantly and forcefully exploited with the infectious clone of equine arterivirus in the study of nidovirus rna synthesis van dinten et al 1997 tijms et al 2001 pasternak et al 2001  however in order for similar studies to be executed with coronavirus infectious clones platforms need to be devised that can produce ample amounts of viral genome and its resulting gene 1 translation product in the initial round of launch this must be done without the generation of significant levels of other rna species that have the propensity to confound analysis or interfere with rna synthesis as of this writing the reported infectious clone systems are not yet sufficiently robust to enable these types of experiments for work involving coronavirus structural genes targeted rna recombination is likely to remain the method of choice for many studies one reason for this is its relative ease of manipulation the largest of the donor rna vectors are still threefold smaller than an entire genome thus mutagenesis at the dna level can generally be carried out without subcloning steps a second strong asset of targeted recombination is that the host range-based selection system has demonstrated both its efficiency in straightforward isolation of desired mutants and its power in recovery of extremely defective mutants such as the m protein truncation and the e gene deletion masters 2002 2003  finally targeted recombination lends itself well to studies involving domain exchange between different proteins peng et al 1995b  the exchange of genomic elements hsue and masters 1997  or the creation of mutants containing multiple mutations in these cases the system through its own selection of allowable crossover sites can reveal which substitutions retain functionality and which are lethal related to this the targeted recombination system establishes a stringent criterion for the lethality of a given mutation if markers silent or otherwise upstream and downstream of the mutation in question can be transferred from a single donor rna to progeny recombinants while the mutation itself is excluded by multiple crossover events then this argues strongly that the mutation produces a lethal phenotype de haan et al 1998 hsue et al 2000  in this situation the donor rna provides its own internal control as mentioned above a similarly convincing standard of lethality for the infectious clones will require a more vigorous rna production at passage zero the sum of these considerations makes it likely that targeted recombination will serve a useful role in coronavirus genetics for some time to come  utility of pan-family assays for rapid viral screening reducing delays in public health 2 responses during pandemics michael

cleemput wim dumon vagner fonseca wasim karim abdool marta giovanetti luiz alcantara carlos koen deforche tulio de oliveira   we are currently faced with a potential global epidemic of a new coronavirus that has infected thousands of people in china and is spreading rapidly around the world this week the who has declared it an global emergency who 2020 the wuhan novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak of 2002 and 2003 the virus is a sars related coronavirus sarsr-cov and it is genetically associated with sarsr-cov strains that infect bats in china zhu et al 2020 lu et al 2020 it causes severe respiratory illness has high fatality rate huang et al 2020 can be transmitted from person to person and has spread to over 15 countries in less than two months who 2020 this coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it they have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously this has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response here we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes the tool also identifies changes at nucleotides coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations figure 1 a reference dataset of previously published coronavirus whole genome sequences wgs was compiled from the virus pathogen resource vipr database wwwviprbrcorg this dataset consisted of 386 whole genome sequences wgs of nine important coronavirus species these included 132 sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus sarsr-cov 121 sequences of beta coronavirus 97 sequences of middle east respiratory syndrome related coronavirus mersr-cov 19 sequences of human coronavirus hku1 9 sequences of murine hepatitis virus 4 of rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 3 of rat coronavirus and one wgs of tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 zariabatcoronavirus and longquan rl rat coronavirus to this reference dataset we added 47 whole genomes of the current coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov outbreak that originated in wuhan china in december 2019 the 2019-ncov sequences were downloaded from the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg together with annotation of its original location collection date and originating and submitting laboratory the 2019-ncov data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this paper and detailed information is provided in supplementary table 1 the 431 reference wgs were aligned with muscle edgar 2004 the alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences cds a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed in phyml guidon  gascuel 2003 lemoine et al 2018 and a bayesian tree using mrbayes ronquist  huelsenbeck 2003 were constructed the trees were visualized in figtree rambaut 2018 we selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster with bootstrap support of 100 and posterior probability of 1 we identified five well supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of sarsr-cov and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool cluster 1 included sars strains from the 2002 and 2003 asian outbreaks in our tool we named this cluster sars-cov outbreak 2000s but may rename it as sars-a if a new proposed naming system for sarsr-cov is adopted in the near future rambaut 2020 cluster 2 provisionally named as sars related cov includes 7 sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks cluster 3 named as bat sars-covhku3 includes three wgs sampled from rhinolophus sinicus ie chinese rufous horseshoe bats cluster 4 bat sars-cov zxc21zc45 includes two sarsr-cov sampled from rhinolophus sinicus bats in zhoushan china cluster 5 provisionally named as wuhan 2019-ncov which may be renamed as sars-b includes one public sequence from the outbreak in wuhan china we identified this cluster with many sequences from gisaid but kept only this one as this is the only genbank sequence accession number mn908947 which was kindly shared by prof yong-zhen zhang and colleagues in the virologicalorg website detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets are available in supplementary table 2 the phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated coronavirus typing tool using the genome detective framework vilsker et al 2019 fonseca et al 2019 to determine the accuracy of this tool each of the 431 test wgs was considered for evaluation ie 384 reference sequences from vipr and 47 public 2019-ncov sequences the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of our method was calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of sarsr-cov sensitivity was computed by the formula tptpfn specificity by tntnfp and accuracy by tptntpfpfntn where tp  true positives fp  false positives tn  true negatives and fn  false negatives classifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps the first step enables virus species assignments and the second which is restricted to sarsr-cov includes phylogenetic analysis the first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to blast and aga analysi aga is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from ncbi refseq virus database aga deforche 2017 expands the optimal alignment algorithms of smith-waterman smith  waterman 1981 and gotoh gotoh 1982 based on an induction state with additional parameters the result is a more accurate aligner as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels in the second step a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the mafft software katoh  standley 2013 in addition a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the hky distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1000 bootstrap replicates using paup swofford the query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support 70 if the bootstrap support is 70 the genotype is reported to be unassigned the result of the phylogenetic and mutational analysis performed by aga is available in a detailed report this report contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper supplementary figure 1 it also presents the virus species and cluster assignments and a detailed table that provides information about open reading frames orfs cds and proteins this table can be expanded to show nucleotide and amino acid mutations that differentiate a query sequence from their species refseq or from a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset all results can be exported to a variety of file formats xml csv excel nexus or fasta the genome detective coronavirus typing tool correctly classified all of the 175 sarsr-cov sequences at species level ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 furthermore all of the 47 2019-ncov wgs that were isolated in china n36 usa n  5 france n2 thailand n2 japan n1 and taiwan n1 were correctly classified at phylogenetic cluster level as 2019-ncov which may be renamed as sars-b in addition we classified with very high specificity sensitivity and accuracy ie 100 all of the 112 sars outbreak wgs of 2002 and 2003 we also achieved perfect classification ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 for all of beta coronavirus humancoronavirushku1 mers-cov rousettusbatcoronavirushku9 and tylonycterisbatcoronavirushku4 at species level for a detailed overview of assignment performance please refer to the supplementary table 3 our tool also allows detailed analysis of coding regions and proteins for each of the coronavirus species for example the analysis of the first released 2019-ncov sequence the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 demonstrated at genome level the nucleotide nt identity was 790 to the reference strain of sarsr-cov accession nc0047183 and that the envelop small membrane protein protein e is the most similar protein in total 948 7377 of the amino acids were identical the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 t55s 56 v56f 69 69deletion and 70 g70r the spike protein protein s which can be associated with virulence was 762 identical to the reference strain of sarsr-cov supplementary table 4a interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 a237f238inshrsy genome nt position 2220222203inscatagaagttat which is just upstream from a cleavage site the most diverse coding regions were the cds sars8a and sars8b in these two regions only 30 of the amino acids were identical sars8b protein was truncated early and its cds had four stop codons supplementary table 4sa our coronavirus typing tool also allows a query sequence to be analysed against a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset for example the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 the identity was 875 to the bat sequence

999 identical and had only two nt mutations supplementary table 4c these two differences were located on positions 22551gt  26016gt which caused three amino acid mutations e2 glycoprotein protein

60 seconds we developed and released the genome detective coronavirus typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of january 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of ncov-2019 infections this tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes it accepts assembled genomes in fasta format or raw ngs data in fastq format from illumina ion torrent pacbio or oxford nanopore technologies ont can be submitted to the genome detective virus tool vilsker et al 2019 to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the coronavirus typing tool user effort is minimal and a user can submit multiple fasta sequences at once the tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner aga to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores this allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally it also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins moreover it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes the tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released ncov-2019 genomes as well as all the 20022003 sars outbreak sequences in conclusion the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a web-based and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes  the heterogeneous landscape and early evolution of pathogen-associated cpg dinucleotides in sars-cov-2 andrea gioacchino di  petrulc anastassia komarova v benjamin greenbaum d rmi monasson simona cocco  sars-cov-2 infection can lead to acute respiratory syndrome in patients which can be due in part to dysregulated immune signalling we analyze here the occurrences of cpg dinucleotides which are putative pathogen-associated molecular patterns along the viral sequence carrying out a comparative analysis with other ssrna viruses and within the coronaviridae family we find the cpg content of sars-cov-2 while low compared to other betacoronaviruses widely fluctuates along its primary sequence while the cpg relative abundance and its associated cpg force parameter 1 are low for the spike protein s and comparable to circulating seasonal coronaviruses such as hku1 they are much greater and comparable to sars and mers for the 3-end of the viral genome in particular the nucleocapsid protein n whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3utrs of all subgenomic rna has high cpg content we speculate this dual nature of cpg content can confer to sars-cov-2 high ability to both enter the host and trigger pattern recognition receptors prrs in different contexts we then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic using a new application of selective forces on dinucleotides to estimate context driven mutational processes we find that synonymous mutations seem driven both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the cpg force in the n protein leading to a loss in cpg content sequence motifs preceding these cpg-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the zinc finger anti-viral protein zap protein keywords-ssrna viruses sars-cov-2 pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps pattern recognition receptors prrs viral host mimicry cpg motifs evolution of synonymous mutations 1 see suppl fig si3 for all the dinucleotide forces computed on a sars-cov-2 genome 2 transitions have largest probability with respect to transversions and are less likely to result in amino acid substitutions  the innate immune system and rna processing machinery recognizes non-self patterns and motifs in viruses that are rarely seen in the hosts they infect these patterns can differ between species 2  when a virus enters a new host it can present pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps in its new host that are rarely seen in circulating strains that have adapted to that hosts immune environment over evolutionary timescales the emergence of sars-cov-2 therefore provides a rare window into innate immune signaling that may be relevant for understanding immune-mediated pathologies of sars-cov-2 anti-viral treatment strategies and the evolutionary dynamics of the virus where evidence for selective pressures on viral features can reflect what defines self in its new host as a case in point the 1918 influenza pandemic was likely caused by a strain that originated in water fowl and entered the human population after possible evolving in an intermediate host that viral genome presented cpg dinucleotides within a context and level of density rarely found in the human genome where they are severely underespressed particularly in a set of genes coding for the proteins associated with antiviral innate immunity 3 2 4 1  over the past century the 1918 h1n1 lineage evolved in a directed manner to lower these motifs and gain upa motifs in a way that could not be explained by its amino acid usage of codon bias 5 1  it has since been found that these motifs can engage the pattern recognition receptors prrs of the innate immune system 6 7  and directly bind the zinc finger anti-viral protein zap both in a cpg dependent manner 8 9 10  hence the interrogation of emergent viruses from this perspective can predict novel host virus interactions covid-19 presents thus far a different pathology than that associated with the 1918 h1n1 which was disproportionately fatal in healthy young adults it has been characterized by a large heterogeneity in the immune response to the virus 11 12 13 and likely dysregulated type i interferon signaling 14 15  various treatments to attenuate inflammatory responses have been proposed and are currently under analysis or being clinically tested 16  it is therefore essential to quantify pathogen-associated patterns in the sars-cov-2 genome for multiple reasons the first is to better understand the pathways engaged by innate immune agonism and the specific agonists to help build better antiviral therapies another is to better predict the evolution of motif content in synonymous mutations in sars-cov-2 as it will help understand the process and timescales of attenuation in humans third is to offer a principled approach for optimizing vaccine strategy for designed strains 17 18 to better reflect human-genome features 20 and ncbi 21  see si1 in this work we will use the framework developed in 1 to carry out a study of non-self associated dinucleotide usage in sars-cov-2 genomes the statistical physics framework is based on the idea of identifying the abundance or scarcity of dinucleotides given their expected usage based on host features in 1 some of us introduced a parameter which we call the selective force that characterizes the deviation with respect to a null model in which the number of dinculeotides is the one statistically expected under a set of constraints for instance the selective force on cpg dinucledoties is zero if the number of cpg is exactly the one expected is positive when it is larger than what is expected and negative otherwise such a force generalizes the dinucleotide relative abundance introduced in 2  not only when choosing the nucleotide bias as the null model but also to a null model built on other features such as a fixed amino acid sequence and reference codon bias cpg forces could be related to the evolutionary constraint to lower or increase cpg number under the pressure of host prrs that recognize a pathogen such formalism has further been applied to identify non-coding rna from repetitive elements in the human genome expressed in cancer that can also engage prrs 19  to characterize the cpg evolution through synonymous mutations in h1n1 1  and to characterize local and non-local forces on dinucleotides across rna viruses 7  we perform an analysis of the landscape of cpg and upa motifs and associated selective forces in sars-cov-2 in comparison with other genomes in the coronavirus family in order to understand specific pamps associated features in the new sars-cov-2 strains sec 21 we also focus on the heterogeneity of cpg motif usage along the sars-cov-2 genome sec 21 and 22 finally we use a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure characterized by the cpg force to study synonymous mutations and in particular those which change cpg content observed since the sars-cov-2 entered the human population sec 23 the latter approach points out at hotspots where new mutations will likely attenuate the virus while evolving in contact with the human host we analyze dinucleotide forces across the sars-cov-2 genome in particular those on cpg and upa motifs 1  as a first check in fig 1 we compare the total cpg forces of sars-cov-2 with other ssrna viruses influenza b 1918 and 2009 h1n1 h5n1 ebola type 1 hiv type 1a hepatitis c and the forces in human transcriptome for coding non coding region 19 as well as the rna for type i interferons fig 1 shows that the total sars-cov-2 force on cpg motifs is larger than influenza b but smaller than the h1n1 strains h5n1 ebola virus therefore putting sars-cov-2 in an intermediate region of cpg forces next we explore more in detail the cpg forces within the coronaviridae family with a particular emphasis on the genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus and on those viruses which infect humans 22  we have first compared the global forces on cpg and upa dinucleotides computed across the whole genome without any constraint on amino acid or codon usage to calculate such forces we need a reference nucleotide bias to give a null model for nucleotide usage see methods sec 41 42 we will in the following use as nucleotide bias the one calculated from the human genome 23  this is the natural choice since we ultimately want to predict regions sensed by prrs as non-self which may engage the human innate immune response we have verified that the specific choice of such bias does not change qualitatively the results in the comparative analysis as long as the same set of reference frequencies is used to compute the forces across viral genomes for instance we obtain similar results in terms of the rank order of viruses using the average frequencies of nucleotides in coronavirus genomes the resulting comparison is summarized in fig 2a  in this case mers shows the highest cpg force among the human coronaviruses followed by sars while some bat coronaviruses have stronger cpg force it is worth noticing that sars-cov-2 is among the viruses with smallest global cpg force and some hcov that circulate in humans with less pathogenicity have a global cpg force comparable or higher than that of sars-cov-2 so there is not a straightforward correlation between global cpg force and the pathology of a coronavirus in humans for the force on upa dinucleotides it is clear already from this comparison that it is anti-correlated with the cpg force as we expect for the complementarity between such motifs 2  due to the fact that the genes and the global length of viruses in the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera are quite similar the comparison of cpg forces gives the same outcome than the direct comparison of the number of cpg along the sequence see supp to go beyond the global analysis we have performed a local analysis on cpg motif usage by looking to the local forces in fixed-length windows along the genome similar results are also obtained by looking directly at the cpg content in the same windows this is done in fig 2c for sars mers sars-cov-2 hcov-hku1 and two representative sequences of bat and pangolin coronaviruses which are chosen because of their closeness in hamming distance to sars-cov-2 the bat-coronavirus sequence is ratg13 the pangolin-coronavirus sequence has been sequenced at guangdong in 2019 it is evident that in some regions especially at the 5 and 3 ends of the sequence the sars-cov-2 sars and mers together with the bat and pangolin viruses have a peak in cpg forces which is absent in the hcov-hku1 as well as in the other hcovs see supp fig si5  the high cpg content at the extremities can have an important effect on the activation of the immune response via sensing as the life cycle of the virus is such that the initial and final part of the genome are those involved in the subgenomic transcription needed for viral replication 26 27  during the infection many more rna fragments with these regions are present in the cytoplasm than the other regions of the viral genome in this sense despite the relatively low cpg content of sars-cov-2 compared to other coronaviruses there is can be a high concentrations of cpg rich rna due to the higher transcription of these regions to complement this analysis in fig 2b upper bar plot we make a direct comparison among the average local cpg forces and standard deviations of the coronaviruses analyzed this shows more clearly that while the sars-cov-2 has an intermediate overall cpg level its variance is very high comparable with that of sars and of two examples of bat and pangolin coronaviruses this suggests a comparison among the coronaviruses based on the part of the sequence with the highest cpg and upa force which is presented in fig 2b lower bar plot in this case the results are much closer to what may be expected mers and sars viruses that are likely less well adapted to a human host have the highest local peaks in cpg content followed by sars-cov-2 and then by seasonal strains that circulate in humans these results are corroborated by the same qualitative picture which comes from the analysis of cpg motif density as shown in suppl fig si 4c it is interesting to notice that high and very high levels of proinflammatory cytokineschemokines such as il-6 and tnf- have been observed in respectively sars and mers and at times sars-cov-2 infection 28 11  we have seen in fig 2c that in all the coronavirus genomes there are regions with large deviations in cpg content with respect to the average whatever we use to measure this content be it density or force and that sars-cov-2 has a particularly high variance when compared with other coronaviruses circulating in humans however most of the viral genome codes for proteins so the analysis should take this feature into account the advantage of the method of dinucleotide forces is that its statistical physics framework allows such constraints to be introduced in a straightforward manner methods sec 42 in fig 3a we perform the local analysis of forces on dinucleotides with the coding constraints by using as reference codon usage bias the human one along all the coding regions of the sars-cov-2 genome and in figs 3b 3c 3d and 3e we focus on the genome regions coding for the nucleocapside n and spike s proteins 29 30 17  a first relevant observation is that the high variability which we discussed in fig 2c is confirmed by this analysis and in particular the 3 peak of high cpg density and force is still present moreover in fig 3a some of the small non-coding regions which are excluded from the figure as they are not used for the computation of the local force are pointed out with black solid lines it seems that large changes in local force happen in the vicinity of these lines thus hinting at a possible role of recombination in the generation of this complex and heterogeneous local cpg-force landscape though such a hypothesis would have to be confirmed by phylogenetic analysis to compare several strains of coronaviruses we focus on the structural proteins which are always present and quite similar across the coronaviridae family notice that all these proteins are coded for after the orf1ab coding region in fig 2c  we computed the cpg force with coding constraints for each structural protein the first protein in the standard 5-to-3 order is the s protein and it corresponds to the low-peak in cpg force and density for sars-cov-2 in fig 2c  the s protein has to bind with ace2 human receptor and tmprss2 30  it is also the longest structural protein in fig 3e the cpg force along the region coding for s s orf computed sars-cov-2 shows the lowest average of cpg force among the human-infecting betacoronaviruses see fig 3b  and also locally it has a force lower than most of the other beta-covs a fascinating as well as speculative reason that could explain the low cpg force on the s protein is again recombination the s protein coding region may come at least in part from other coronaviruses that better bound human entry receptors 31  the second longest structural protein is the n protein fig 3c shows the local computation of cpg forces under coding constraints restricted to this protein coded for in a region n orf of about 12 kb close to the 3-end of the viral genomes in this case it is apparent that the cpg force in the sars-cov-2 is much higher immediately below that of sars and above that of mers this is confirmed by the comparison of the total cpg force computed for n across the human-infecting members of the coronaviridae family presented in fig 3d  this high cpg content together with the large concentration of n transcripts and similar sequences as a part of all other subgenomic rnas 27  could confound the global prediction that sars-cov-2 presents low levels of dinucleotide patterns to receptors that can recognize them which may be relevant to innate recognition of the virus in the comparative analysis of structural proteins in the coronaviridae family the e protein is the one showing the largest difference in cpg forces between coronaviruses that circulate in humans see supp fig si6b  however the fact that the e protein is short coded for in about 228 nucleotides makes the computation of the local forces less stable that is small variations in cpg number may correspond to large force variations the m protein is also quite short coded for in about 669 nucleotides and has smaller cpg force differences among species see supp fig si6c  we therefore focus in the next section on the two longest structural proteins s and n to check for the ability of our model to explain and possibly predict the cpg changes via synonymous mutations in protein coding regions 23 a quantitative model for early evolution of cpg motifs in sars-cov-2 as seen in the previous sections sars-cov-2 has regions which have higher cpg content and forces than strains that have been circulating in humans while the number of cpgs and the corresponding force is much lower in other regions it is therefore interesting to ask to what extent the cpg force model is able to predict any bias in the synonymous mutations already detectable in the few months of evolution since the first sars-cov-2 genome was sequenced data from gisaid 25  reference sequence wuhan 26-12-2019 last updated sequence 2020-05-27 see methods sec 45 and consequently could allow us to predict putative mutational hotspots in the viral evolution barring confounding effects we would expect that some regions such as the n orf will be driven by host mimicry towards a lower number of cpg motifs other regions such as the the s orf have already low cpg content and would feel no pressure to keep the cpg content at that level so random mutations would likely increase their cpg numbers these predictions are in good agreement with the observed mutations in current sars-cov-2 data as shown in fig 4a  we see that the n and s subsequences undergo synonymous mutations that decrease blue or increase red their numbers of cpg we also show the local cpg force constrained by codon and amino acid usage same as fig 3a  along the sequence most of the mutations that decrease the number of cpg are located at the 3-end of the sequence in correspondence with the high peak in cpg force in the n orf region conversely mutations that increase the number of cpg are found in orf1ab in the low-cpg-force regions and in the s orf region we first focus on the n protein the locations of synonymous mutations and multiplicities the number of sequences in which they are found to occur are indicated by star symbols of corresponding sizes in fig 4b  we observed a total number of ms  619 synonymous variants with 93 unique mutations out of these ms variants 245 and 17 respectively lower and increase cpg while the remaining 357 leave cpg content unchanged it is remarkable than more than 93 of the mutations that affect the cpg count decrease it when restricting the analysis on the 245 mutated sequences in which the cpg count decreases the losses take place in at 17 different loci the nucleotide motifs preceding these loci are listed in the top 17 lines of table 1  together with their positions along sars-cov-2 wuhan 26122019 and their number of occurrences in the sequence data 8 out of 17 of these motifs which represent 157 out of the 245 observed cpg losses are of the type cnxgxcg where nx is a spacer of n nucleotides and were identified as zap binding patterns in 9  the binding affinity of zap to the motifs strongly depends on the spacer length n with top affinity for n7 9  notice that 3 out of the 8 cpg-suppression related motifs in sars-cov-2 correspond to n7 other motifs of the type cnxgccg are also present in sars-cov-2 but their cpg is not lost in sequence data see last 4 lines of table 1  the dissociation constants associated to their spacer lengths are on average larger than the ones of the motifs showing cpg loss where the spacer nx includes n  4 5 7 or 8 nucleotides for which the cpg dinucleotide was lost in some of the mutated sequences these motifs were shown to be binding patterns for the zap protein in 9  the dissociation constants were measured for repeated a spacers with values in m k d 4  033  005 k d 5  049  010 k d 7  012  004 k d 8  064  014 9  the next 9 lines show the other cpg lost through mutations and their 10 preceding nucleotides which do not correspond to motifs tested in 9  the last 4 lines show other subsequences in the n protein known as binding motifs of zap from 9  but for which no loss of cpg is observed in the sequence data for the s protein see fig 4d and star sizes we observed ms  872 synonymous variants with 220 unique mutations among these unique mutations 67 and 106 respectively lower and increase the cpg content therefore only 39 of the mutations that affect the cpg count decreases it these results seem to support the existence of early selection pressure to lower cpg occurrence in n orf but not in s orf moreover according to our model mutations are not only driven by the local cpg force but also by viral codon bias computed on the reference sequence 3  it is therefore theoretically possible and in full accord with our model that even in low cpg force regions a mutation decreasing the cpg number is favorable due to the biases introduced by the distribution of synonymous codons we developed a computational framework to estimate the odds of transition to a mutated sequence from sars-cov-2 wuhan 26-12-2019 based on the cpg-force model methods sec 43  for a synonymous mutation that does not change cpg our synonymous mutation score sms defined in methods sec 43 will only depend on the change in codon biases due to the mutation additionally mutations affecting cpg content bring contributions to the transition probabilities that depend on the local cpg force in fig 4 we show our predictions for synonymous mutations in the n 4b 4c and the s 4d 4e proteins figs 4b and 4d show sms along respectively the n and s sequences and the mutations respectively lowering blue increasing red or leaving unchanged black the cpg content we observe that the majority of mutations taking into account multiplicity labeled by stars in the figure in sars-cov-2 correspond to high sms in agreement with our model to make our arguments more quantitative we tested the ability of our model to discriminate between observed and non-observed mutations in figs 4c and 4e we show the histograms of the sms corresponding to observed synonymous variants in green and to putative mutations that would leave amino-acid content unchanged but have not been observed so far in yellow the distribution of sms for observed mutations is shifted to higher values compared to their counterparts for non-observed mutations both for the proteins n and s hence our model is able to statistically discriminate between non-observed and observed synonymous mutations anova f-test 212 for n and 665 for s note that for the null mutational models in which synonymous mutational rate are uniform the score distribution for observed and unobserved mutations is equally peaked at zero anova f-test1 a simpler model for the sms using codon bias only without force suppl fig si7 is also able to discriminate between observed and non-observed mutations albeit with a smaller score for protein n anova f-test99 and a comparable result for s anova f-test657 further demonstrating that s orf synonymous mutations are likely due to a neutral reversion to the mean while n orf mutations may contain an additional pressure notice that similar results are obtained if we consider unique mutations dropping any information about multiplicity anova f-test59 n protein 158 s protein see suppl fig si8  we have further performed comparative tests of our model in which mutations are driven by codon bias and cpg forces with simpler models using i only the transition versus transversion rate with ratio 41 32 trs-trv bias methods sec 44 ii the transition versus transversion rate and cpg force iii a uniform rate null model described above and iv a uniform rate and cpg force the results of these additional tests are shown in suppl fig si9  the anova f-test and p-values are shown in table 2 and confirm that while the uniform rate and the transition versus transversion bias are not enough to separate the score distributions between observed and unobserved mutations for the n orf adding a cpg force gives a very clear separation in the two cases while for the s orf we observe a still present but less marked separation we checked the consistency of our results at different times since our first analysis dated 2020-04-22 see suppl table 4  consequently mutation data seem to confirm the hypothesis that the cpg force drives the evolution of synonymous mutations to lower number of cpg motifs in the n orf for the s orf which already has quite low cpg number the situation is less clear the observed tendency to cpg increase through synonymous mutations is compatible with the presence of a force pushing up this number but is equally well explained by the viral codon bias model this uncertainty is expected from the relatively small number of mutations with a cpg change in s protein region in the sequences collected so far the present work contains three main directions in the early analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes and dinucleotide motifs particularly cpg usage first a comparative analysis with other genomes in the coronaviridae family which has stressed that a peculiarity of sars-cov-2 with respect to the other coronavirus genomes is a globally lower cpg content though not particularly low compared to other rna viruses accompanied by large fluctuations along the genome notably the segment coding for the s protein has a much lower cpg content and force other regions in particular the region after the slippage site in orf1ab and the initial and final part of the genome including the n orf are characterized by a larger density of cpg motifs and corresponding cpg force which are comparable to the sars and mers viruses in the betacoronavirus genus interestingly the initial and final part of the genome are implied in the full-genome and subgenomic viral replication in particular the coding region of the n protein and its rna sequence present in the 3 untranslated region utrs of all sars-cov-2 subgenomic rnas has been shown in 27 to be the most abundant transcript in the cytoplasm the high concentration of this feature could contribute to a dysregulated innate immune response sars-cov-2 due to its complex replication machinery does not express its rna at uniform concentration a mechanism generating different densities of pamps being presented to the immune system at different points in the viral life cycle can affect immune recognition and regulation the precise way this can contribute to immuno-pathologies associated with covid-19 and how this is related to the cytokine signaling dysfunction associated with severe cases need further experimental investigation the sharp heterogeneity of the cpg abundance along the sars-cov-2 genome is also compatible with viral recombination in agreement with the hypothesis stated in 31  the degree to which this heterogeneity in any way reflects zoonotic origins should be further carried out using phylogeny a first analysis of the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of covid-19 shows that mutations increasing cpg content have occurred in the middle and low cpg content regions in particular the s protein region conversely mutations lowering the number of cpg have taken place in regions with higher cpg content in particular the n protein region the sequence motifs preceding the loci of the cpg removed by mutations match some of the strongly binding patterns of the zap protein 9  natural sequence evolution seems to be compatible for protein n with our model in which synonymous mutations are driven by the virus codon bias and the cpg forces leading to a progressive loss in cpg these losses are expected to lower the cpg forces until they reach the equilibrium values in human host as is seen in coronaviruses commonly circulating in human population 33  more data collected at an unprecedented pace 34 25 24  and on a longer evolutionary time are needed to confirm these hypothesis sars-cov-2 has a low mutation rate for an rna virus due to the presence of a proofreading mechanism in its replication 35  an integrative study of the transmissivity of the sars-cov-2 and its mutation rate could be performed to predict the time scale at which such natural evolution driven by host mimicry would bring the virus to an equilibrium with its host 5 1  while the results presented here are preliminary due to the early genomics of this emerging virus they point to interesting future directions to identifying the drivers of sars-cov-2 evolution and building better antiviral therapies note added on june 4th 2020 our analysis have been updated with all sequence data now available the conclusions drawn from our may 6th analysis now shown in supplementary are still valid in particular more unique mutations lowering cpg have occurred in the n orf region over the last month 9 loci on may 6th 17 loci on june 4th and the proportion of mutations lowering cpg has increased 91 on may 6th 93 on june 4th in addition r nchioua and colleagues have shown the importance of zap in controlling the response against sars-cov-2 see 36  by proving that a knock-out of this protein increases sars-cov-2 replication the aim of this section is to give an overview of the methods used throughout this work and to explain why for some analyses we used one method rather than the others we want to characterize the cpg content of a given genome the different methods that we used to achieve this result discussed with their usage cases and their limits are the following  a first possibility is to simply count the number of dinucleotide motifs or to compute their density along the whole genome this simple count can be useful to see if there is an evolution of the motif number over time or to study local fluctuations along a sequence to identify regions in which a motif is abundant or scarce but it is not suitable to make comparisons among viruses of different families mainly because of the different length and usage biases of viral genomes however since we focused mostly on the coronaviridae family these differences are not so important and indeed we can see in suppl fig si4 that some of our results are also apparent from the motif density analysis  the force defines the abundance or scarcity of a motif given its expected usage based on the nucleotide bias it can be computed on the whole or part of the genome in this work we always use to calculate the force the human nucleotide bias as reference bias in sec 42 we detail the force calculation an important remark is that the force is directly related to the relative abundance f ab f af b of a motif of nucleotides a and b with respect to their bias f ab is the frequency of the motif and f a f b the reference biases of nucleotides a and b 2  see eq 4 and si sec si2 this method gives results qualitatively similar to the cpg-density methods for the local analysis however it allows in principle also comparisons among more different genomes as was done in fig 1   as shown in sec 42 the calculation of the force can be extended to constrain variability of nucleotidic sequences at fixed codons and using as reference bias the codon bias this way of computing forces takes into account the fact that the virus has to code for certain specific proteins in its genome we always used here the human codon bias as reference to compute this force with codon constraints calculating forces at fixed codon usage allows us to confirm also in this framework the identification of high-and low-cpg force regions in sec 22 and it was crucial to investigate the dynamics of the synonymous mutations in viral evolution sec 23 the model at the core of many of the analyses made here is taken from 1  here we briefly review the model together with its simplified version which does not take into account the codon constraint let us start from the latter given a motif m and a sequence s0  s1     sn  of length n  we consider the ensemble of all sequences with length n  which we denote with s and we suppose the probability of observing s out of this ensemble to be here f si is the nucleotide bias that the i-th nucleotide is si for example we always used in this work the human frequency of nucleotides as f si x is the force we want to compute and nm is the number of times the motif m appears in the sequence z is the normalization constant that is therefore the force x is a parameter which quantifies the lack if negative or abundance if positive of occurrences of m with respect to the number of occurrences due to the local probabilities f si we can fix x by requiring that the number of motifs in the observed sequence nms0  n0 is equal to the average number of motifs computed through the model n  that is notice that this is exactly equivalent to the request that x maximizes the probability of having observed s0 let us focus now on the specific case of a dinucleotide motif that is our motif m consists of the pair ab where a and b are two consecutive nucleotides for example a  c and b  g for the cpg motif in this case within an approximation discussed in the si sec si2 the force computed as above turns out to be the logarithm of the relative abundance index that is where f ab is the number of motifs ab divided by the total length of the sequence n  in suppl fig si1 we tested the accuracy of this approximation in our specific case our model can be improved to take into account the fact that not all the possible sequences with length n can be observed if the genome is coding for one or more proteins if we restrict the ensemble of sequences to those coding for the same protein we obtain the model with the codon constraints that we used for several of our analyses here in this case we write each sequence s as a series of codons and its probability is defined as where now the bias takes the form of a codon usage bias and the normalization constant z changes accordingly into a sum over all possible synonymous sequences the force x can be computed analogously with the procedure for the simpler case by requiring that the number of motifs observed in s0 is equal to the model average although this creates some technical difficulties which have been overcome in 1  we use the model introduced above in eq 1 to assign a score which we call synonymous mutation score sms to each possible synonymous mutation of a reference sequence we consider a system evolving for a small time scale and a mutation which changes the i-th codon ci into a synonymous c i  the transition probability that is the probability of observing the mutation for such evolution can be decomposed in the product of two evolution operators the first t ncg  n cg  representing the change in the number of cpg motifs in the mutated sequence and the second t ci  c i  representing the gain in mutating the particular codon in position i the first operator can be computed from the dynamical equation introduced in 1 for the evolution of the cpg number ncg of a sequence under a initial force x through a equilibrium force xeq the equilibrium force is the force computed on a viral strain which is supposed to be to the equilibrium with the human innate immune system because it has evolved in the human host since a long time eq 6 was used in 1 to describe the evolution of the cpg numpber in h1n1 taking as the equilibrium force the one of the influenza b strain in analogy with this approach we take here as feq the average force calculated for the given segment or coding region on the seasonal hcovs that is hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43  is a parameter determining the characteristic time scale for synonymous mutations based on eq 6 we define the transition operator for cpg number as where ncg  n cg  ncg notice that for all the synonymous mutations leaving unchanged the cpg number the above operator is one the codon mutational operator is where f ci is the frequency of codon ci from the chosen codon usage bias putting together these two terms allows us to estimate how likely a specific synonymous mutation is to happen the synonymous mutation score sms accompanying a mutation is defined as the logarithm of this quantity it is well known that transversions i e mutations of purines in pyrimidines and vice-versa are suppressed with respect to transitions i e mutations of purines in purines or pyrimidines in pyrimidine we introduce here a simple way to account for penalties for transversions in the uniform codon bias we suppose that a mutation with n transversions happens 4 times less than a mutation with n  1 transversions therefore starting from a uniform probability of mutating a codon c into a synonymous codon c  we insert the transvertion penalty and obtain that this probability becomes where tc c  is the number of transvertions needed to mutate c into c  here n is a normalization constant such that the sum runs over the synonymous of c without including c then we can define for a fixed set of synonym codons a transition matrix t cc  pc  c  the codon usage bias for synonyms mutations with transversion penalties is the stationary probability distribution of the markov chain having the matrix defined in eq 12 as transition operator this stationary distribution is therefore given by the unique vector of probabilities bc such that by solving this set of equations together with the requests that c bc  1 for each set of synonymous codons we obtain our codon usage bias we have repeated this calculation for all amino acids we used this modified bias which is not very different from the uniform one to perform anova f-tests together with other codon usage biases see table 2 and suppl  sars-cov-2 sequences are taken from gisaid 25  we collected each sequence present in the database on 2020-06-02 the most recent sequence was collected on 2020-05-27 before any of our analyses we discarded all the sequences where one or more nucleotides were wrongly read this left us with 6788 sars-cov-2 sequences to obtain fig 2 we considered in addition to the sars-cov-2 sequences are taken from gisaid other alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus sequences whole genomes and genes which have been obtained from vipr 24  the pre-processing consisted again of discarding all the sequences with one error or more after this process we collected 341 sars 48 mers 20 hcov-229e 48 hcov-nl63 14 hcov-hku1 124 hcov-nl63 166 bat-covs and 5 pangolin-covs whole genomes for fig 2a and for fig 2b lower panel we used the largest number possible of sequences up to a maximum of 100 for fig 2b upper panel and fig 2c we chose a single sequence for each species however we checked that the result is qualitatively the same if we use other sequences from the same species for human coronaviruses to obtain the plots in fig 3 and fig 4  we considered as reference sars-cov-2 sequence the one which has been collected on 26-12-2019 id epi isl 406798 sequences has been processed to ensure the correct reading frame this means for instance that the orf1ab gene is read in the standard frame up to the ribosomal shifting site and it is read in the shifted frame from that site up to the end of the polyprotein to produce the bar plots in figs 3b and 3d we collected genes data on vipr then we discarded as usual all the sequences with one or more errors and we computed for each gene an average of up to 20 different sequences coming from the same species for some structural proteins we did not find 20 different genes but in any case the standard deviation of the averages presented in figs 3b and 3d is smaller than 0025 and for most of the viruses much smaller more detailed information about the genomes used in this work are given in supplementary si1 where  denotes the kroneker delta function in the spirit of a cluster expansion we write e xs i as i1 b  1  gii1 si2 where gii1  e x  1 si a si1 b inserting back this into eq si1 we obtain now we can compute each term in the cluster expansion and we get for the k-th term where we defined g  e x  1 f a f b now we suppose n  2m that is n is even however we will consider soon the large-n limit where this request is not necessary anymore therefore we have to proceed further we can consider the case where g 1 this is a good approximation when x 0 and it is also fairly good as long as x is lower than 0 as in all the cases studied here under this hypothesis we have where in the last step we used also that n 1 from this by using that n  x log z and requesting n  n0  n f ab we obtain eq 4 fig si1 shows the correlation between the cpg force with the nucleotide bias and the cpg relative abundance  figure si1 comparison between the cpg force and the cpg relative abundance index as discussed in sec si2 these two quantities are almost identical when the genome is long to show that here 10 different genomes for several coronavirus species are used to compute these two quantities and the dashed blue line is a linear fit of the resulting points sars-cov-2 genomes are collected at an unprecedented pace with tens of genomes added daily we updated our analysis several times since the first version of this manuscript has been posted on biorxiv and our results are consistently verified by mutations observed in recent genomes to compare the analyses performed with the most recent genomes and those that we obtained previously we collected all the sars-cov-2 sequences submitted to gisaid up to 2020-04-30 last updated sequence collected on 2020-04-21 and we report here the analogous of tables 1 and 2 and of fig 4 computed with those sequences respectively as tables 3 4 and fig si2  we also show in table 5 the comparison of the number of synonymous variants total and restricted to cpg increasing or decreasing observed in s and n orfs with early and present-day genomes table 2  computed with the sequences submitted to gisaid by 2020-04-30 although the availability of fewer data lowers the f-test results most of the times and therefore gives a higher pvalue with respect to table 2  the qualitative results are very similar for instance it remains true that the score given through the transition-transversion bias alone cannot distinguish between the obersved and non-observed mutations while these two cases become distinguishable if the cpg force is added especially for the n orf table 5  total number of synonymous variants and cpg

of the sequences used fig 4  computed with the sequences submitted to gisaid by 2020-04-30 we observe less mutations than those in fig 4 due to the smaller database of sequences but the results are qualitatively very similar figure si 3 all dinucleotide forces computed on the whole sars-cov-2 genome without any codon constraint the cpg motif is the one with the largest force in absolute value and the second one is tpg which is one transition away from cpg   how the sars vaccine effort can learn from hivspeeding towards the future learning from the past anne de groot s   due to a remarkable effort coordinated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars team at who an understanding of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and etiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome was achieved less than 2 months from the announcement of the outbreak in china as a result of this groundbreaking international collaboration we now know that the sars epidemic is due to a human coronavirus hcov infection now named sars-coronavirus sars-cov several sars-coronavirus genomes have been mapped and the functions of at least some of the proteins have been determined 1 2 these genomes are now available on genbank making it possible for laboratories around the world to begin the process of building a safe and effective sars vaccine although there is much to learn about sars many lessons can already be drawn from our experience with hiv the first lesson to keep in mind concerns strain variability sars like hiv is a rna virus whose replication is error-prone studies of 14 separate sars strains that emerged from a single point source suggest a pattern of evolution in response to immune pressure that is much like the evolution of hiv some forms of coronavirusmurine hepatitis virus in particularare known to mutate to escape from host immune response will clades and strains of sars emerge as they have for hiv if so will sars vaccine researchers be able to develop a vaccine that adequately addresses this problem hiv vaccine developers were slow to address hiv variability scientists involved in the sars vaccine effort must address this issue more promptly more important the hiv vaccine development effort initially focused on replicating the approach that had been used to develop hepatitis b vaccine development which was to clone and express the surface protein of the virus this simplistic approach to a complex virus was recently proven to be a failure 3 will scientists once again pursue quick and easy solutions in the hopes of stimulating a protective antibody response despite existing evidence that coronavirus vaccines for animals based on the s or spike surface protein have largely been ineffective in order to best define an effective sars vaccine approach it is important to consider the correlates of protection from coronaviruses in animal models and any evidence for immunity that may be emerging from clinical experience little is known as yet about the human immune response to sars-cov but much can be learned from examining the immunology of other coronaviruses and the history of coronavirus vaccines we must also examine the hostpathogen interaction and ask whether specific antigens proteins derived from the pathogen or host responses such as antibodies and t cell response provide any insight into the type of vaccine that should be developed sars like hiv has the potential to set off a global pandemic in this article we argue that there is much to be learned from the pastboth in terms of building a cooperative approach in order to expedite the development of an effective vaccine and in terms of the scientific knowledge that has emerged as a result of this collaborative process 4 there is no better time to begin working on a new sars vaccine than now it is imperative to capture this moment when the virus is relatively new before clades and strains of this highly virulent airborne virus emerge coronavirus is a common and worldwide pathogen that infects a variety of mammals and birds this virus has been classified into three groups sars-cov has now been assigned to a fourth group because it is unlike other existing coronaviruses 5 coronavirus experts participating in a meeting on sars recently held at the nih
1 reached the following consensus that the sars-cov is most like group 2 which includes bovine and murine coronaviruses 6 coronaviruses are positive-strand single-strand rna viruses that belong to the order nidovirales which also includes the families arteriviridae coronaviridae and roniviridae the coronaviridae family contains the genuses coronavirus and torovirus the genus coronavirus is broken down into three groups sars-cov has been assigned to a fourth group see fig 1
7 human coronavirus infections hcov are seasonal they generally manifest as wintertime respiratory infections and enteric infections mostly in infants 12 months adult infections are less common than infections among children hcov can also rarely cause neurological syndromes reinfection appears to be common even though antigenic variation is limited in the s or spike protein given that the full extent of hcov variation has yet to be determined it is possible that variations in other non-structural proteins may allow escape from immunity a phenomenon that has been observed with other coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus 8 9 in contrast with hcov re-infection with sars-cov appears to be relatively rare and in at least one case according to investigators reporting from hong kong at the recent nih conference on sars the reoccurrence was associated with a milder form of the illness while reinfection in the case of common-cold coronavirus hcov-229e implies either that immunity is incomplete or that antigenic variation impedes the development of immunity the low rate of reinfection based on available data that has been observed with sars and the high rate of recovery from acute illness in the absence of effective medical therapy approximately 80 of young adults do recover suggest that protection from disease is achievable this raises hope for the development of a vaccine however escape mutations in response to immune pressure have been observed as with hiv 8 9 and selected point mutations are known to causes major shifts in the pathogenicity of coronaviruses as well as in tissue specificity 10 the fact that the virus is famously difficult to replicate without error and that it is able to tolerate large reductions as well as point mutations in its genome suggest that variation in the sequence of sars can be expected as the epidemic continues to move through human populations much as has been observed with hiv accordingly the evolution of strain variability and the identification of conserved or cross-strain epitopes will need to be monitored during the development of a sars-cov vaccine just as the emergence of new strains is monitored for influenza the genome for the coronavirus believed to be responsible for the global outbreak of sars has been sequenced 11 amplification of short regions of the polymerase gene the most strongly conserved part of the coronavirus genome by rt-pcr and nucleotide sequencing has revealed that the sars virus is a novel coronavirus that has not previously been present in human populations this conclusion is confirmed by serological investigations 12 sars-coronavirus appears to be a novel coronavirus that falls midway between the cat and human species although many coronavirus experts believe that it is closer to group 2 coronavirus bovine cov and mhv the sars-cov genome is 29727 nucleotides in length and the genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses eleven open reading frames corresponding to known coronavirus proteins include the polymerase protein polymerase 1a 1b spike protein s small membrane protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n have been identified fig 2
7 these 11 open reading frames are believed to encode as many as 23 separate proteins with both known and unknown functions most of the non-structural proteins seem to be encoded in the first half of the genome whereas most of the structural proteins such as spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid are located in the second half of the genome mutations in the genome have already been described 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 according to a recent report comparing 14 sars genomes linked by a common point source despite the limited amount of time that elapsed between primary transmission at hotel m and the development of secondary cases in singapore less than 2 months a total of 94 amino acid sequence mutations in the rna polymerase the spike glycoprotein the membrane nucleocapsid and several uncharacterized putative proteins were identified 5 fig 2
 one particular amino acid change in position 22222 of the genome an isoleucine residue changed to a threonine a non-conservative amino acid change in the s1 region of the spike protein has been observed this modification which occurred during the carriage of sars-cov from hong kong hotel m to singapore by one patient may have allowed the virus to escape immune response mutations have previously been observed in the mhv spike protein in response to pressure from cell-mediated immune response 13 mutation of a large genome 30000 bases in response to immune pressure is an ominous sign for the future of vaccine development against sars-cov and indicates that we may see a degree of variation in the sars genome that matches or exceeds hiv the most common reported clinical presentation of sars based on hospitalized patients is fever 94 more than half of persons affected 5172 report general influenza-like symptoms chills malaise gastrointestinal symptoms loss of appetite and myalgia 14 the mean incubation period of sars is estimated to be between 4 and 6 days the case fatality rate has been as high as 15 for patients younger than 60 years and can be higher than 50 for patients aged 60 years or older nearly 40 of patients developed respiratory failure that requires assisted ventilation 15 most cases occur within 7 days of infection in guandong 70 cases occurred within 7 days after a single point-exposure 16 unfortunately given that the clinical manifestations of sars do not allow ready distinction from other common respiratory viral infections the diagnosis of sars may become more difficult as epidemiological links with travel to selected areas diminish over time rapid and accurate diagnostic tools will be critical in the management of this epidemic once these tools are available we may discover as we did with hiv that there are indeed many more persons who are infected yet do not manifest the illnessin other words hospitalized patients may represent just the tip of the iceberg diagnostic tests for sars are currently limited to antibody assays dependent on the development of ab thus detection of infection is only possible 1012 days following infection and pcr assays sensitive but technically difficult in some settings and likely to be false-negative in the early days of the infection transmission occurs by droplet transmission and may also occur by the fecal oral route although food is not as yet a suspected means of transmission in the current outbreak sars-cov can be detected at the time of clinical presentation persisting throughout acute illness and decreasing during convalescence according to reports from investigators speaking at the nih conference on sars respiratory secretions are still pcr positive but no virus has been cultured more than 40 days after presentation as are stool samples in animal coronavirus infection the s protein spike a prominent transmembrane protein two domains s1 and s2 determines the species and tissue specificity of each coronavirus 17 modifications of s are associated with changes in the type of cell targeted by the virus epithelial cells such as those that line the respiratory tract appear to represent the main target for sars although hepatic renal cardiac and ophthalmic tissues may be infected by other coronaviruses coronaviruses have also been reported to infect macrophages in the course of hcov respiratory infections growth of the virus in infected cells appears to be localized to the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract sars-cov in contrast appears to affect cells lining the lower respiratory tract even though growth in human cell lines is not a common feature of coronaviruses sars virus can be grown in vero cells a fibroblast cell line sars-cov infection results in a cytopathic effect and budding of coronavirus-like particles from the endoplasmic reticulum within infected cells 12 sars-cov does not infect mice nor according to cdc investigators speaking at the nih conference does it infect scid the host target cell range and target cell receptor for sars-cov remain to be discovered at this time finally due to the limited host cell range of the virus no adequate animal model for sars-cov has been found the current sars outbreak is believed to have originated in china in late 2002 who issued a global alert about the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome on 12 march 2003 while only five deaths were reported at that time there was immediate and grave concern about the rapid spread of the disease within 2 weeks 11 countries had also reported cases for a total of 569 cases or 264 not including chinese cases in response to these developments cdc issued interim guidance concerning infection control precautions in the health-care and community setting and raised concerns about international travel despite these precautions the numbers of persons and countries affected continued to climb as of 26 may 2003 the who reported a cumulative total of 8202 probable cases with 725 deaths from 28 countries httpwwwwhointcsren fig 3
 health-care workers are increasingly affected by sars the most recent re-emergence of sars in canada is clearly linked to nosocomial transmission 18 while local epidemics can be contained with sound barrier precautions there is good reason to believe that sars will become endemic and that outbreaks will recur during the fall and winter transmission seasons one reason to believe that sars will become endemic is that transmission of the virus continues unabated in regions outside of larger cities in china as of 30 may 2003 nine regions in china qualified as having category b second generation or c epidemiologically unlinked transmission
2 pattern c transmission is mainly occurring in regions outside larger cities such as inner mongolia as of this writing no cases of sars had been described in africa india or south america but the impact of the arrival of sars which spreads by both airborne and fecal-oral routes in regions of the world where crowded cities poor sanitation and fragile health-care infrastructures are a fact of life is likely to be revealed over the next few months as with hiv uncontrolled transmission can be expected to occur in regions of the world where access to health-care is poor and understanding of the basic precepts of infectious disease transmissibility is extremely limited transmission in pattern c cases may be due to asymptomatic shedders of the sars virus canadian and chinese physicians reported to assembled scientists at the nih conference on sars that a least 14 of contacts in canada and a number of cases in hong kong showed evidence of infection seroconversion but did not report symptoms thus the number of total infections if asymptomatic shedders are included may be much higher than previously reported furthermore serologic evidence of infection has been observed in a range of small animals suggesting that animal reservoirs may exist which would mean that complete eradication of the virus by quarantine may be difficult to achieve no information is available on the immune correlates of protection to sars we are thus forced to extrapolate from available clinical information and from information gleaned from the study of coronavirus infections in animals several aspects of the clinical presentation of sars deserve mention first of all 7080 of individuals recover from infection and there appears to be a relationship between recovery and decline in viral load 7 this suggestion that immunity can be acquired offers great promises for the development of an effective vaccine second anecdotal reports of individuals who have seroconverted but never reported an illness indicate that immunity to infection can occur rapidly after exposure in some individuals and moreover that illness may be preventable third elderly individuals have been observed to have the highest mortality rate greater than 50 higher mortality rates in older individuals may be due to their limited ability to generate new b and t cell responses and contain new infections in summary immunity to sars is achievable and illness may be prevented lastly the clinical presentation of sars is subacute unlike most infectious diseases except for chronic viral diseases like hiv and hepatitis c sars is characterized by a long 510 day prodromal phase a gradual climb in the viral load peaking around day 10 and a decline in viral load by day 15 as symptoms improvefor those individuals who recover from the illness studies contrasting patients who do recover with those who do not have not yet been performed immune responses may contain and possibly also exacerbate sars while t cell responses would be expected to be present as soon as day 24 of infection antibody seroconversion has been shown to occur at around day 10 when symptoms can exacerbate antibody-mediated exacerbation has been observed in two separate coronaviral diseases in animals feline infectious peritonitis and bovine coronavirus-associated shipping fever see below currently the only accepted clinical intervention in sars has been aggressive suppression of local immune responses using high dose and inhaled steroids ribivarin which has also been used is known to modulate immune responses and may have no direct effect on the sars virus itself both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses have been associated with exacerbations of disease in some coronavirus infectionsthese adverse effects must be carefully considered when designing a vaccine for example in the case of murine hepatitis virus mhv a group 2 coronavirus disease t cell response is protective but t cells of both types cd4 and cd8 have been implicated in the demyelination of the brain and spinal cord following infection with neurotropic mhv 19 20 antibody response may also be detrimental in the setting of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in chickensalthough incomplete there is some evidence that birds that have low level humoral immunity as measured by antibody titers in tears do worse than those with higher levels of humoral immune response 21 there is also a link between humoral responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus and the development of shipping fever attributed to a bovine respiratory coronavirus in cattle feedlots 22 correlates of protection from coronavirus disease have been studied in animal models coronavirus experts have emphasized that there is a wide range of coronavirus diseases and that the clinical manifestations of the disease and the correlates of protection can vary widely between pathogens and between animal models both humoral and cellular immune responses contribute to protection against coronavirus disease in animal models in some settings antibodies and t cells contribute to exacerbation of the pathology although the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood and the role of cd8 versus humoral responses is hotly debated in coronavirus infections such as mhv and bocv bovine coronavirus also group 2 t cells are critical to protection against illness both cd4 and cd8 t cells t helper and cytotoxic t cells or ctl respectively are involved 23 24 t cell immunity is also required for protection against porcine endemic diarrhea virus pedv 25 and both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are involved in the immune response to turkey coronavirus infection tcov 26 infectious bronchitis virus is a devastating disease for chicken producers and has been the focus of many vaccine studies both cd8 and cd4 t cells appear to be involved in the protective immune response to ibv 24 25 26 27 it is also important to note that cross-virus t cell immunity does exist as has been described between japanese encephalitis virus jev and west nile virus wnv in animal models 28 for example pigs who have had been exposed to porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv are protected against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus vte in a protective immune response that is attributed to t cells protection correlates with t cell proliferation 29 there is evidence in mhv that t cells are required to eradicate infection while antibody is involved in reducing viral load during acute infection 30 these differences may be related to the ability of some coronaviruses to form syncitia note that syncitia-like giant cells were observed in lung tissue specimens derived from sars patients 31 if cell-to-cell transmission via syncitia formation also occurs in sars eradication of the sars-cov may also not be achieved by humoral response alone therefore t cell immunity may be required to clear infection 23 a number of laboratories have mapped t cell epitopes in coronavirus infections for example cd4 t cell epitopes have been identified in the m and nucleocapsid proteins of mhv 32 33 in the nucleocapsid of an avian coronavirus 34 and in tgev of swine 35 persistent infection in the case of mhv seems to be due to ctl escape mutations in the viral genomes that abrogate the ability of the cellular immune system to stimulate ctl response mutation occurs even in the mhv spike protein in response pressure from cell-mediated immune response 13 escape from ctl response may allow mhv to persist in the cns 8 9 36 the mhv-specific ctl response is polyclonal but ctl escape occurs nonetheless 37 38 this type of mutation in response to immune pressure that has been observed for some coronaviruses is highly reminiscent of ctl escape that has been observed in the course of hiv infection since sars-cov like hiv is an rna virus that has an error-prone replication mechanism there is reason to be concerned that variants of sars-cov that escape cellular immune response may also evolve mutations in the sars-cov genome in the s protein which may have occurred in response to immune pressure have been described 7 live attenuated coronavirus vaccines can be made by deletion in group specific genes which are specific for each of the groupsdeleting these genes does not alter replication but does attenuate the virus 39 live attenuated ibv vaccine has been combined with inactivated ibv with good success in broiler chickens 29 live attenuated vaccines have also been made using a more traditional method which consists in passaging the virus obtained from one species of animal pigs in cells derived from another species cattle 40 in general the fact that live attenuated vaccines are significantly more effective than whole killed vaccines in animal disease suggests that the development of cell-mediated immunity is critical to protection against coronaviruses however there is great concern that the vaccine strain could recombine with wild type circulating strains 41 and it is unlikely that the fda will approve the use of live attenuated sars-cov vaccines in humans without extensive evidence that recombination and reversion to virulence do not occur whole killed vaccines are very common in the animal food industry as they are generally safe and cheap to produce autologous vaccines which are vaccines that are developed for a virus circulating in a specific herd of cattle or group of chickens are often used and limited licenses are issued to allow the use of these vaccines in a specific geographic region this approach has been used with coronaviruses as both bocv and ibv are significant pathogens for cattle and chickens a whole killed bovine coronavirus vaccine has been developed for cattle that appeared to be safe and effective 42 an inactivated canine coronavirus vaccine is available to protect against canine coronavirus in young dogs however as it is not clear that this killed vaccine can protect against different strains of canine coronavirus the vaccine is underutilized in the veterinary industry 43 in a comparison of vaccines to prevent ibv live attenuated vaccine appeared to be much more effective than whole killed vaccine 44 recombinant subunit vaccines use of molecular biology techniques to produce large quantities of recombinant viral proteins are likewise expected to be limited in their ability to protect against viruses that have evolved in the human population under immune pressure causing significant variation in the viral genome while recombinant technology will certainly permit the rapid development of a sars spike protein-based vaccineefforts are already underway to produce such proteins safelythe need for t cell immunity as has been shown with mhv and bocv two related viruses and the description of s1 region variability so early in the epidemic point to the fact that this approach will need to be supplemented by a cell-mediated immunity-directed vaccine which is relevant to the whole of the sars genome a recombinant fowlpox containing the s1 gene of ibv has been produced and was shown to be relatively protective against ibv 45 a fowlpox virus expressing c terminal nucleocapsid protein of ibv has also been developed this construct protects against challenge by homologous strain and some cross-strain protection has also been observed this cross-strain protection may have been due to effective presentation of conserved ctl epitopes by the viral vector 46 a dna vaccine containing the nucleoprotein gene of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus ptgv has been used to vaccinate against gastroenteritisboth humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are induced 47 note that who officials have raised concern that coronavirus variation will make it difficult to develop a single vaccine based on the spike protein as with flu it may become necessary to update the vaccine which would require similar global surveillance the vectored approach dna or viral vector is currently highly favored by coronavirus experts the dna prime and adenovirus or mva boost approach that is currently being explored for hiv vaccine development might be an avenue worth exploring for the sars pathogen a multi-valent multi gene mixed humoral and cell-mediated approach is strongly supported by coronavirus experts since all of the animal models point to the involvement of more than one arm of the immune system epitopes are easily delivered in the context of dna or viral vectors an epitope-driven approach to coronavirus vaccine development has already been attempted with some success 48 one advantage of the epitope based approach is that any region of the sars-cov genome that may be similar to self and therefore associated with a potential for autoimmune effectscan be eliminated the epitope-based approach would avoid any possibility of reversion to virulence and may be better able to avoid the type of vaccine-induced enhancement of disease that appears to be associated with some vaccines against bocv fipv and mhv a cell-mediated immunity-directed vaccine that is highly unlikely to recombine this statement is most true with epitope-based vaccines and least true with live attenuated vaccines could also be useful for the treatment of sars this method has been used for some hiv vaccines and could provide an ethically appropriate avenue for the testing of a safe epitope-based sars vaccine in humans variation leads to escape as subunit or whole killed vaccines can only prime against one strain of virus their efficacy against variant viruses may be lower if sars evolves as hiv has the development of viral variability may preclude the use of a single strain of sars-cov in a vaccine one means of solving the problem of variability is to search for conserved epitopes that are conserved across strains of sars-cov epitopes that are highly mutable will not protect against sars-cov as the virus evolves which may make the selection of epitopes that are highly conserved as with the some hiv vaccines under development 4 very relevant here there is much to be learned from the hiv vaccine effort and from previous studies of coronavirus vaccines in animals that is applicable to sars there are worrisome similarities between sars-cov and hiv both are rna viruses and able to mutate under selection pressure in the host and coronaviruses are especially prone to mutation and recombination sars-cov sequencing has already uncovered some evidence of mutation in response to immune pressure selecting multiple highly conserved achilles heel epitopes from the sars immunome as has been done for at least one hiv vaccine prototype 4 will permit the development of a vaccine that will remain relevant as sars-cov evolves both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses may be required to protect against sars-cov there is however some evidence from animal studies that humoral response to some coronaviruses can contribute to host pathology and the role of antibody in the exacerbation of disease in sars has yet to be defined until the role of antibody is clarified vaccines directed at eliciting humoral immunity need to be evaluated for their potential to exacerbate disease cross-reactive t cell responses have also been implicated in host pathology in the mhv model therefore developing a t cell-directed vaccine that is composed of t cell epitopes that are in no way cross-reactive with the host may be the safest approach consideration might also be given to combining a t cell-directed vaccine with a whole recombinant vectored spike protein vaccine should both vaccines prove safe and efficacious the immune responses of recovering and convalescent sars patients provide the most important measure of immunity to sars vaccine design the immune responses of these patients should be used to direct the development of the vaccine in conclusion the development of a sars vaccine should be pursued with the utmost urgency as sars is highly lethal and is likely to become endemic in underdeveloped regions of the world a pathway to vaccine development that will take advantage of the collective expertise of the vaccine development community making available vaccine components such as vectors and delivery vehicles that have been previously evaluated in human clinical trials will expedite the development of a vaccine research reagents should also be collected and shared these would include sars peptides adjuvants dna vaccine vectors and clinical grade viral vectors we have much to learn from the hiv vaccine effort which has been marred by grandstanding and poor cooperation rapidly developing a collaborative approach to developing a sars vaccine that will be both effective and safe is the best way to address

germany during the 201011 influenza season valeria falcone sibylle bierbaum winfried kern udo kontny hartmut bertz daniela huzly marcus panning   the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century emerged in mexico in march 2009 and was caused by a novel influenza ah1n109 virus ah1n1pdm09 in general the course of the pandemic was moderate from a public-health perspective however a particular proportion of the human population including immunocompromised patients children and pregnant women was at risk to develop severe disease hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na represent two major surface glycoproteins of influenza virus the ha determines host-receptor tropism and constitutes the key immunogenic site for the human immune response since the beginning of the 2009 pandemic ah1n1pdm09 rapidly evolved and seven different cladesgroups characterized by distinct molecular markers in the ha gene have been reported 23 the d222g mutation in the receptor-binding domain of the ha gene has been linked to severe cases 10 of note another mutation involving the same residue d222e was also observed but could not be associated with more severe cases 1 understanding the molecular evolution of influenza virus is therefore crucial to identify mutations that might be associated with a more virulent phenotype the second surface glycoprotein na facilitates the release of newly synthesized virions from infected cells 5 neuraminidase can be blocked by antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir which act by interfering with the release of progeny virus thereby preventing new rounds of infection a single point mutation at position 275 in the neuraminidase glycoprotein resulting in a histidine-to-tyrosine shift can confer resistance to oseltamivir 13 aim of this study was to investigate the molecular evolution of ah1n1pdm09 in the 201011 influenza season in southern germany by sequence analysis of the ha gene of mild moderate and severe influenza cases particular attention was paid to immunocompromised patients moreover the occurrence of resistance to oseltamivir the only drug currently recommended for prophylaxis in high-risk groups was determined

software version 19 spss chicago usa data were compared by fishers exact test and p-values were deemed significant at the 005 level in order to detect molecular changes in the ha gene of influenza virus 33 ah1n1pdm09 ha sequences representing 25 individual patients were analysed as shown in table 1 14 of the 25 patients 56  were immunocompromised or immunosuppressed suffering from different underlying diseases virus isolates on mdck siat-1 cells were obtained from 28 of the 33 respiratory samples data not shown 16 the median age of the patients was 40 years 95  confidence interval ci 229-443 years based on clinical criteria 1125 44  were regarded as mild median age 6 years range 1-55 years 10 40  as moderate median age 53 years range 01-76 years and 4 16  as severe cases median age 47 years range 02-55 years according to zarychanski et al 27 all severe cases were hospitalized patients known to be at risk for severe disease 3 of these 4 patients were immunocompromised and one of them was obese only 1 of the 11 immunocompetent patients and 3 of the 14 immunocompromised patients developed severe disease fishers exact test p060
 in 7 21  of the 33 samples corresponding to 5 20  of the 25 patients co-infection with another respiratory virus was detected coronavirus oc43 andor nl63 were detected in 3 of these 5 patients rsv and human bocavirus were co-detected in the npa of one and rsv alone was detected in a pharyngeal swab from another patient clinically the patient with rsv and bocavirus co-infection presented with mild disease the remaining patients displayed moderate n3 to severe n1 symptoms none of the patients showed co-infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae as assessed by multiplex pcr prolonged shedding i e  2 weeks of influenza virus in the respiratory tract was observed in 6 of the 25 patients 24  3 with severe 2 with moderate and 1 with mild disease a total of 5 out of 6 patients were immunocompromised and 5 of the 25 patients 4 of them immunocompromised received oseltamivir therapy the ha sequences were closely related to each other and to the reference strain acalifornia072009 acalh1n109 the differences between german sequences and acalh1n109 ranged from 5 to 10 amino acids table 2 all of the viruses analysed displayed the amino acid changes p83s and s203t in the ha1 region as well as i321v and e 374 k in the ha2 region
 phylogenetic analysis showed simultaneous co-circulation of influenza virus of groups 4 5 6 and 7 in southern germany figure 1 genetic groups were named according to the ecdc technical document of augustseptember 2011 in detail 16 of the 33 sequences 48  belonged to genetic group 6 characterized by the double mutation d97n and s185t moreover 3 of these 6 showed an additional s84i mutation as influenza adelawareaf217642010 and one of them had a p159s mutation of note this particular strain was isolated from an influenza-vaccinated individual ten of the 33 sequences 30  belonged to genetic group 5 characterized by the mutations d97n r205k i216v and v249l in this group three also had the h138q mutation as observed by piralla et al 18 two sub-clusters were seen within this group group 4 characterized by amino acid mutations n125d included four sequences all obtained from the same patient finally 3 of the 33 sequences 9  clustered within group 7 and were characterized by the mutations s185t s143g and a197t double mutations characteristic of group 3 a134t s183p and group 2 n31d s162n were not observed severe moderate and mild cases were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree
 some of the observed amino acid substitutions involved the major antigenic sites of the ha molecule table 2 five potential n-glycosylation sites typical of acalh1n109 corresponding to residues 23 87 276 287 and 481 were also detected in the german sequences however in two patients two additional glycosylation sites were detected at residue 119 lysine to asparagine in one case and at residue162 serine to asparagine in the other case as shown in table 2 jx413805 and jx413803 correspond to sequences obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract of the same patient interestingly the k119n mutation representing an additional potential n-glycosylation site was present only in the bal sample moreover the cycle threshold ct value of the h1n1 real-time rt-pcr for the throat swab was 26 compared to 19 for the bal sample suggesting a higher concentration of the virus in the lower than in the upper respiratory tract similarly in another severe case the ct value for the bal sample obtained 20 days after onset of disease was lower ct 21 than that for the nasopharyngeal swab ct 29 also in this case two additional amino acid changes k130r and m344l genbank accession number jx483122 were detected in the bal sample treatment with oseltamivir was reported in 5 of the 25 patients 4 immunocompromised patients and 1 obese patient the oseltamivir-resistance-associated mutation h275y was detected in 1 20  of the 5 treated patients a one-year-old child with a genetic disorder who was treated for 21 days with oseltamivir he recovered fully from influenza despite development of oseltamivir resistance and prolonged shedding of resistant virus for  2 weeks in this molecular study we were able to show that influenza viruses circulating in southern germany in the first post-pandemic season differed relatively little from each other and from the vaccine strain acalh1n109 some of the amino acid substitutions that were observed involved the major antigenic sites of the ha molecule five classical antigenic sites sa sb ca1 ca2 and cb have been described in the ha of seasonal influenza h1n1 virus 3 24 all located in the globular head of ha recent studies have also described some important antigenic sites in the stem region of ha 25 all viruses analysed here had the amino acid changes p83s and s203t in the ha1 region and i321v and e374k in the ha2 region as reported by others 8 18 19 and as published in the ecdc report released in augustseptember 2011 23 co-circulation of different genetic groups was observed group 6 characterized by mutations d97n and s185t was the dominant h1n1 lineage 48  followed by group 5 33  d97n r205k i216v group 4 12  n125d and group 7 9  s185t s143g a197t although a number of mutations have been reported in circulating ah1n1pdm09 they have not significantly affected virus antigenicity and pathogenicity as demonstrated by in vitro studies 26 clinically the mutations d222g and n have been associated with a more virulent phenotype 10 however recent studies show that within the current ah1n1pdm09 ha framework the effect of the 222 mutation on receptor binding appears to be less dramatic when compared to the 1918 influenza ah1n1 virus ha framework since the binding preference for 2-6 sialylglycans is still maintained 26 also other mutations such as the double mutation n125d and e374k have been associated with a more virulent phenotype this double mutation has been associated with several breakthrough infections despite influenza vaccinations and was identified in some fatal cases 2 moreover it was associated with decreased antibody recognition in vaccinated individuals 21 the german ha sequences carrying this double mutation originated from an unvaccinated immunocompromised individual with severe illness due to the lack of serum specimens we could not analyze the ability of antibodies to recognize the hemagglutinin of ah1n1pdm09 in our study however immune escape from the vaccine strains might be an issue of concern no d222g change was observed here in our study no association of a specific amino acid change with severe illness could be observed however in two patients differences between the ha sequence could be detected in viruses isolated either from the upper respiratory tract urt or the lower respiratory tract lrt in particular two additional mutations k130r-m344l in one case and k119n- i216k in the other case were identified only in the lrt moreover analysis of potential glycosylation sites revealed that the k119n mutation provides an additional potential glycosylation site human influenza viruses carrying the k119n mutation show improved growth in eggs and appear to exhibit enhanced virulence in the mouse model 9 14 glycosylation at position 119 is essential for improved virus protein yield in eggs 14 egg adaptation of human influenza viruses is known to increase their affinity for the 23-sialic acid sa receptor and concomitantly impairs their ability to bind to 26-sa 11 although it is clear that influenza virus tropism depends on several viral and host factors and not only on ha specificity the presence of the k119n mutation exclusively in the virus isolated from the lrt might indicate a more efficient bindingreplication of viruses carrying this mutation toin cells expressing 23-sa importantly 23-sa is known to be found in abundance in the lower respiratory tract 20 of note the ct value of the ah1n1pdm09 real-time rt-pcr from the nasopharyngeal swab was higher than that of the bal sample carrying the mutation ct 26 versus ct 19 since bal samples are usually significantly more diluted than nasopharyngeal swabs the observed difference suggests a real replication advantage of the strain harboured in the lrt virus histochemistry studies could be used to analyze the pattern of binding of mutants to human respiratory tissue as already suggested 6 22 moreover analysis of growth curves of the two isolates in different cell lines may reveal a possible replication advantage at least in cell culture many patients with influenza have more than one viral agent with reported co-infection frequencies as high as 20  4 we detected co-infection with another respiratory virus in 7 out of 33 samples 21  corresponding to 5 of the 25 patients 20  the most frequent co-infecting agents were coronaviruses 5 of 7 samples followed by rsv 2 of 7 samples and human bocavirus 17 disease resulting from co-infection with influenza virus and coronaviruses has been reported to be more severe 4 although the number of influenza virus and coronavirus co-infections is low 4 15 17 here patients co-infected with coronaviruses showed moderate to severe disease whereas co-infection with rsv and human bocavirus in one child resulted in mild disease finally the oseltamivir-resistance-associated mutation h275y was detected only once in our study population although oseltamivir has been widely used in the 2009 pandemic and thereafter cases of resistance have remained scarce to date however prolonged shedding of high levels of resistant influenza virus in individual cases poses the threat of spread into populations that are at risk and finally into the general population as resistant viruses retain fitness 7 in concordance with other studies our results underline the importance of monitoring influenza virus evolution and development of resistant viruses of note the lrt might harbour more virulent variants than the urt immune escape of influenza virus in subsequent influenza seasons is an issue of concern making continuous surveillance essential  molecular characterization of a chinese vaccine strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus mutations that may contribute to attenuation chengbao wang jianfei chen hongyan shi huaji qiu fei xue changming liu yuanmao zhu shengwang liu fernando almazn luis enjuanes li feng   members of the coronaviridae within the order nidovirales contain positive-stranded rna genomes that range from 27 kb to 31 kb in size 1 transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev together with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and the human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hku1 belongs to the genus alphacoronaviruses httpwwwictvonlineorg tgev is an enveloped virus that contains a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of about 285 kb in length its genome includes nine open reading frames orfs that encode four structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleoprotein n and five nonstructural proteins the replicases 1a and 1ab proteins 3a and 3b and protein 7 in the order 5-replicase 1a1bs3a3bemn7-3 2 tgev was initially identified as the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis tge in swine in 1946 in the united states 3 4 in neonates tgev infects the epithelial cells of the small intestines leading to potentially fatal gastroenteritis the virus can also lead to infection in the upper respiratory tract and less often in the lungs 5 in adults tgev causes mild disease in swine it is the major cause of viral enteritis and fetal diarrhea in neonates resulting in significant economic losses 6 tgev was reported in many swine-producing countries between the late 1980s and the 1990s 710 tgev strains of varying virulence have been isolated and characterized worldwide 1114 some strains have been used to develop modified live vaccines with limited success in china a tge outbreak was first reported in the 1970s since then it has been prevalent in many provinces and has become one of the most important viral diarrhea diseases in china the chinese tgev vaccine strain h165 was derived from a virulent field strain h16 by 165 passages in pk15 cells h165 virus was proven to be safe in piglets and pregnant sows and efficacious against tgev infection 15 vaccines based on the h165 strain are currently commercially available to prevent and control tgev infections in china to genetically characterize the chinese vaccine strain h165 and its parental strain h16 at the molecular level we determined the complete nucleotide nt sequences of the h165 and h16 viruses to determine the molecular basis for attenuation of the chinese tgev vaccine strain the deduced amino acid aa sequences of the structural and non-structural proteins of the h165 and h16 viruses were compared with those of tgev reference strains as well as with that of the porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv strain prcv-isu-1 the pig kidney cell line pk-15 atcc ccl-33 was regularly maintained in eagles minimum essential medium mem supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum penicillin 100 uml streptomycin 100 gml and 1 mm na-pyruvate the chinese vaccine strain h165 and its parental strain h16 were obtained by our laboratory 15 total rna was extracted from pk-15 cells infected with h165 virus and from purified h16 virus using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen the resulting rna pellet was resuspended in 10 l dnase-free rnase-free double-distilled water and was used as a template for rt-pcr the complete genomes of the h165 virus and its parental strain h16 were amplified by rt-pcr and sequenced the reverse transcriptase step was performed with superscript iii reverse transcriptase invitrogen using a combined random priming or oligo dt priming strategy and the resulting cdna was amplified by pcr using primerstar hs dna polymerase takara primers were designed based on conserved regions of the tgev strains their sequences are available on request for amplification of the tgev subclones reactions were carried out in a total of volume of 50 l containing 10 l of 5  pcr buffer 4 l of 25 mmoll dntps 05 l of taq polymerase takara 1 l of each specific primer 20 m about 25 ng of template and sterile deionized water the pcr protocols was carried out for 30 cycles at 98c for 10 s 55c for 15 s and 68c for several minutes depending on the size of the amplicons the 5 and 3 ends of the viral genome were confirmed by rapid amplification of cdna ends using the smart race cdna amplification kit clontech the pcr amplicons were purified using the axypreptm gel extraction kit axygen and cloned into pgem-t easy vector promega three to five independent clones of each tgev amplicon were isolated and sequenced using the m13 universal primers sequences were assembled and edited to obtain the complete genome sequences of the viral strains h165 and h16 the complete nt sequences of the h165 and h16 strains were submitted to the genbank sequence database and assigned accession nos eu074218 and fj755618 orfs were predicted using the gene runner program version 300 httpwwwgenerunnercom the nt sequences of both genomes and the deduced aa sequences of the orfs were compared to several tgev strains and the prcv strain prcv-isu-1 multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the megalign program from the dnastar software package version 710 dnastar inc usa the sequences used for analysis were the available strains on 4 february 2010 in the genbank prediction of signal peptides and their cleavage sites was performed using signalp software 16 prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using tmhmm software 17 potential n-glycosylation sites were predicted using scanprosite software 18 the secondary structures of the 5 and 3-untranslated regions utrs of the h165 and h16 viruses were predicted using rnadraw 11 software 19 full-length genome sequences were generated by several overlapping cdna fragments to encompass the entire rna genomes of strains h165 and h16 the findings indicated that the genome sequence was 28569 nt in length including a poly a tail of 30 nt the genome encodes nine orfs characteristic of the genus alphacoronavirus and 5 and 3 untranslated sequences of 314 and 274 nt respectively which do not include the poly a tail the predicted orfs 1a nt 31512368 and 1ab nt 1232620368 of the chinese vaccine strain h165 contained 12051 and 8040 nt encoding the non-structural proteins 1a and 1ab respectively orf 1ab contained a 43 nt region that overlapped with orf 1a and included a typical coronavirus slippery site 5-uuuaaac-3 nt 1233212338 based on evidence from other tgev coronaviruses 20 this sequence causes a 1 frameshift during the translation of orf1a which results in a portion of the proteins protein 1ab avoiding translation termination and containing an additional 2680 aa the structural proteins s e m and n were found to be encoded by orfs s nt 2036524711 e nt 2581526063 m nt 2607426862 and n nt 2687528023 respectively furthermore the three non-structural proteins 3a 3b and 7 were identified to be encoded by orfs 3a nt 2481425023 3b nt 2509425828 and 7 nt 2802928265 respectively upstream of eight of the genes of the chinese vaccine strain h165 and its parental strain h16 there was a repeated intergenic sequence 5-cuaaac-3 called a transcription regulating sequence trs 21 sequence analysis showed that strains h165 and h16 were more closely related to strains miller m6 and ts than the other reference strains table 1 strains h165 and h16 shared between 983 and 999 nt identity to the other tgev reference strains being slightly less closely related to strains purdue and sc-y with around 985987 and 983 nt identity respectively table 1 they were also less closely related to strain prcv-isu-1 with around 979 of nt identity nearly all the orfs of strains h165 and h16 were highly similar to those of strains miller m6 and ts 984100 nt and 952100 aa identity except for 889 and 529 nt identity with strain miller m60 genes 3a and 3b respectively which are attributable to the fact that miller m60 has a 531 nt in frame deletion in gene 3 22 in order to investigate the relationships among tgev strains and prcv-isu-1 a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the genome sequences of strains h165 and h16 strain prcv-isu-1 and the available tgev strains in the genbank as shown in fig 1 strains h165 and h16 were confirmed to be more closely related to the tgev miller strains than the purdue strains or strain prcv-isu-1 to further explore the evolutionary relationship among strains the s protein sequences were used to investigate genetic relatedness among tgev strains and strain prcv-isu-1 phylogenetic tree constructed using the available s protein sequences showed that the reference strains were grouped into five distinct clusters fig 2 strains h165 and h16 formed a cluster with strains miller m60 hn2002 miller m6 ts tsx 96-1933 tfi fs77270 and to14 taken together these results it appears that strains h165 and h16 are more closely related to strains miller m60 hn2002 miller m6 and ts than to the other chinese tgev strains even though they are of chinese origin


 compared with its parental strain h16 there was no mutation deletion or insertion in the 5 and 3-utr both the 5 and 3 ends of the genome of the two strains contain short utrs the 5-utr comprises 314 nt and includes a potential short aug-initiated orf nt 117123 begins in a suboptimal kozak context gccaugg for translation 23 and potentially encodes peptides of three aa mks analysis of the 5-utr showed a high level of secondary structure with three simple and two complex stem-loop structures data not shown as predicted using the software rnadraw 11 the 3-utr comprises 274 nt 2826628539 and possess an octameric sequence of ggaagagc beginning at nt 198205 upstream from the poly a tail and possess a poly a tail of 30 nt a high level of secondary structure with six simple and one complex stem-loop structures data not shown predicted using rnadraw 11 which has been shown to be important in enterovirus replication 24 as shown in table 2 there were a total of 27 nt mutations identified in strain h165 resulting in a total of 16 aa mutations mainly located within proteins 1a 1ab s 3a 3b and e moreover a point mutation a25074gorf3 was found in the intergenic region between the genes 3a and 3b in brief there were 13 8 2 and 2 nt mutations in the genes 1 s 3 and sm resulting in 7 5 2 and 2 aa differences from its parental strain h16 respectively table 2 furthermore six nt mutations g6014torf1a t12388corf1b t21937cs t21969as a26025ce and c27507tn could be the makers used to differentiate the chinese vaccine strain from other strains of tgev in the genbank comparisons with the other two pairs of attenuated and virulent tgev strains virulent purdue and p115 miller m6 and miller m60 revealed no common mutations among them
 scanprosite analysis of the proteins s m and n of strains h165 and h16 showed that there were thirty-three seven nxs and twenty-six nxt three two nxs and one nxt and four three nxs and one nxt potential n-linked glycosylation sites respectively no n-linked glycosylation site was identified in the e proteins of strains h165 and h16 signalp analysis of the proteins s of strains h165 and h16 showed that there was a potential cleavage site between aa 16 and 17 revealing a signal peptide probability of 0995 it was predicted to contain a signal anchor probability 0998 at position 30 with a cleavage site between aa 37 and 38 in e proteins of strains h165 and h16 an n-terminal signal peptide was also identified in the m proteins of strains h165 and h16 with a potential cleavage site between aa 16 and 17 revealing a signal peptide probability of 0931 the s proteins of strains h165 and h16 were the typical type i membrane protein with the n-terminal 1411 aa residues exposed on the outside of the cell surface or virus particle and a transmembrane domain near the c-terminus aa 14121434 followed by a cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues aa 14351472 there was also a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues at position 13941412 with a maximum value of 3467 at position 1398 and a minimum value of 2967 at position 953954 one transmembrane domain was predicted at position 1537 of proteins e of strains h165 and h16 by tmhmm analysis which predicted the n-terminus of the e protein to be external to the cell surface or viral envelope three transmembrane domains were predicted to be present at positions 4668 78100 and 112134 of proteins m of strains h165 and h16 by tmhmm analysis with a stretch of eight aa seesfnpe directly adjacent to the third hydrophobic domain since tgev was identified in 1946 researchers have tried to attenuate the virulence of field tgev in order to develop an appropriated attenuated vaccine some tgev isolates gradually lose their virulence and developed to be commercially attenuated tgev vaccines after continuous passages in cell culture strain h165 derived from a virulent strain h16 by 165 passages in pk-15 cells has been proven to be safe in piglets and pregnant sows and displays efficacy against tgev infection 15 in this study sequence analysis showed that passaging of strain h16 in pk-15 cells resulted in 27 nt mutations that caused 16 aa mutations in strain h165 relative to strain h16 the mutation rate observed was lower than that previously attained in studies by zhang 14 where twenty and thirty-two aa mutations were found in strains miller m60 and purdue p115 respectively when compared to their virulent counterparts up to now there were only seven tgev strains and one prcv strain prcv-isu-1 had been fully sequenced though partial sequences of tgev strains were available in the genbank moreover only two virulent and attenuated tgev pairs were reported 14 whole genome sequences of strains h165 and h16 will help us to understand the genetic basis of tgev coronavirus attenuation and enhance the geographic differentiation information among tgev strains the 5 and 3-utr regions of tgev genome are crucial for viral replication and transcription 25 futhermore the 5 and 3-utr regions had been demonstrated to be targeted for the attenuation of some viruses 26 in this study no mutation deletion or insertion was detected in the 5 and 3-utr regions of strains h165 and h16 moreover the single nt difference from the two pairs of virulentattenuated tgev strains found in the 5-utr of strains h165 and h16 may not abolish the role in viral replication and transcription the second conserved region involves the gene 1a a frameshift region that forms a typical coronavirus slippery sequence 5-uuuaaac-3 and a pseudo-knot structure which is proposed to be critical for the transcription of gene 1ab that involves ribosomal frame shifting 20 though a nt mutation was found in the trs of the gene 3b for virulent purdue and attenuated p115 strains 14 no mutation was found in the conserved region trs 5-cuaaac-3 located upstream of each gene serve as signals for the transcription of the sgrnas in this study of the fifteen nt mutations identified in orfs 1a 1ab 3a and 3b eleven led to aa mutations in nonstructural proteins of strain h165 seven of eleven mutations were present in proteins 1a and 1ab with two aa mutations present in proteins 3a and 3b respectively the proteins 1a and 1ab are expressed by ribosomal frameshifting and polyprotein cleavage a comparative analysis of replicative polyproteins of coronaviruses and arteriviruses identified the most variable regions in the n-terminal half of protein 1a 2729 and four aa mutations s296corf1a r653korf1a a745vorf1a and l1900forf1a in protein 1a were found to occur in the n-terminal half of protein 1a while 1 aa mutation p3867rorf1a occurred in the c-terminal of protein 1a a point mutation within the replicase gene 1a had been demonstrated to affect coronavirus genome versus minigenome replication differentially 30 although attempts to delete the replicase non-conserved domains to determine whether they are essential have not yet been made deletion of genes 3a and 3b reduced tgev virulence very little 31 further studies will be needed to ascertain the roles of the two aa mutations a55sorf3a and a144torf3b in proteins 3a and 3b as well as one nt mutation a25074gorf3 identified in the intergenic region between the genes 3a and 3b no aa mutations were present in proteins m and n but two aa mutations occurred in protein e and five aa mutations occurred in protein s which had been demonstrated to be an antigen for a neutralizing antibody for coronaviruses and play vital roles in viral entry cell-to-cell spread and determining tissue tropism 3235 all of the five aa mutations p48ss l514ps f525ps d671gs and i740ss in protein s had also been found to occur in the n-terminal 1411 aa residues which had been predicted to expose on the outside of the cell surface or virus particle antigenic site ab has been mapped from aa 506706 of protein s 36 previously studies showed that there were two aa mutations for m60 within this region as compared to m6 and four aa mutations for purdue p115 as compared to virulent purdue 14 in this study there were three aa mutations for h165 as compared to h16 in the corresponding region it has been implied that protein s may be related to the virulence of tgev 35 37 however whether these five aa mutations in protein s had influenced the virulence of h16 will require additional work by using a reverse genetics system and the characterization of these mutations in animal experiments there are also one aa mutation f23ve to be found in position 1537 of protein e which showed that the n-terminus of protein e to be external to the cell surface or viral envelope in summary most of the aa mutations identified were located in the functional regions of the tgev genome such as in the most variable regions of the protein 1a of the tgev s296corf1a r653korf1a a745vorf1a and l1900forf1a at the n-terminal p48ss l514ps f525ps d671gs and i740ss of protein s and its antigenic site l514ps f525ps and d671gs as well as in the putative transmembrane domain f23ve all of which are hypothesized to have the potential to affect virus replication signal transport and antibody neutralization processes associated with tgev future studies could involve generating specific mutants via reverse genetics and characterizing these mutants in animal experiments in addition the findings from our study also revealed that six unique nt mutations g6014torf1a t12388corf1b t21937cs t21969as a26025ce and c27507tn in the genome sequence of chinese vaccine strain h165 that could be the markers used to differentiate strain 165 from the other strains of tgev furthermore a rapid differentiation method to differentiate h165 from wild-type viruses of tgev had been established by restriction fragment length polymorphism of the n gene based on the nt mutation c27507tn data not shown whole genome sequences of strains h165 and h16 may enhance our understanding of the evolution of tgev coronavirus as well as the other coronaviruses  on the mechanisms of bananin activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zai wang jiandong huang kinling wong peigang wang haojie zhang julian tanner a ottavia spiga andrea bernini bojian zheng neri niccolai   at the beginning of the 21st century a novel virus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov moved into the human population causing sars with a high rate of mortality although the last reported epidemic of sars dates back to april 2004 the fact that this virus can replicate in a large number of animals including dogs cats pigs mice ferrets foxes monkeys and rats 1 2 3 in addition to the natural hosts comprising chinese palm civets raccoondogs and bats 4 5 6 is of particular concern suggesting that preparedness with vaccines and antiviral drugs against this potentially reemerging agent is necessary it has been shown that treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids as possible drugs against sarscov only had slight beneficial effects or even enhanced viral replication in mice 7 8 thus development of new antisars drug is urgently needed for the potential sars reemergence the relative conservation and essentialness in functionality of a particular gene are used as indicators to evaluate a drug target on the basis of these criteria helicase is a good target being a relatively conserved protein in sarscov eg a less variable protein compared to spike protein and critical for viral replication 9 accordingly the latter protein has been proposed as an attractive target for antisars research 10 in analogy with the promising results obtained for herpes simplex virus1 11 12 in the present study a structurally driven investigation for the design of new sarscov helicase inhibitors is performed by correlating the predicted enzyme structure 13 with the observed bananin activity against sarscov 14 bananins are a class of compounds with a unique structural signature incorporating a trioxaadamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative to add potential cytoprotective functionality 15 several parent adamantane derivatives are already used clinically 16 17 although the antiviral activity of the newly developed bananin has not yet been investigated extensively in vitro assays demonstrated that bananin effectively interferes with sarscov atpase activity by inhibiting helicase activity furthermore in a cell culture system of sarscov bananin inhibited viral replication at a half maximal effective concentration of less than 10 m and a concentration causing 50 of cell death of over 300 m suggesting that it represents a promising antiviral drug candidate 10 to investigate bananin primary targets bananinresistant viruses were selected by culturing sarscov gz50 strain genbank accession number ay304495 on fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line frhk4 in the presence of high concentrations of this adamantine derivative the half maximal effective concentration of bananin on these mutant viruses was demonstrated to be more than 50 m mutations were found in helicase s259l membrane protein a68v and r124w and spike proteins n479i the transexpression of mutant helicase or membrane protein during wildtype virus infection can rescue viral replication in the presence of bananin demonstrating that the sarscov helicase and m proteins were effective drug targets 14 the present study describes the systematic search for those mutations found in bananinresistant sarscov variants subsequently structural and functional results are compared to define the possible mechanisms of bananin activity and are also used to drive restrained docking simulations of the bananinsarscov helicase interaction aiming to define the sterical requirements of new antiviral drugs all the mutations found in the isolated bananinresistant sarscov variants are summarized in table 1 of primary relevance is the fact that the s259l mutation in helicase is always present as well as the a68v and r124w mutations in membrane protein this finding initially suggested that the observed antiviral activity could arise from bananin interference on a hypothetical helicasemembrane protein interaction as in the case of the closelyrelated coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus where the replicase protein complex including helicase colocalizes with m in the endoplasmic reticulumgolgi intermediate compartment for virion packaging 18 thus coimmunofluorescense and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed although no evidence of helicasemembrane protein interaction could be obtained doc s1 and fig s1 thus the mechanisms of bananin activity have been ascribed to the binding of the small molecule to single viral proteins and in particular to those exhibiting mutations in the bananin resistant sarscov variants as shown in table 1 mutations in spike protein helicase and membrane protein have been detected by using scorecons software 19 which quantifies residue conservation in multiple sequence alignments shannons entropies have been calculated for each of the sarscov protein sequence positions where mutations have been observed in the case of sarscov spike protein sequence shannons entropy in the range from 0 for invariant to 1 for hypervariable protein sequence positions reveals that the 479 position where the ni mutation is found corresponds to a highly variable site a shannons entropy value of 072 is obtained by retrieving all of the 92 complete sequences of sarscov spike protein present in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi databases the fact that bananin does not target on sarscov entry doc s1 and fig s2 suggests that no bananinrelated activity can be attributed to the n479i mutation for the sarscov membrane protein only secondary structure predictions can be obtained limiting a detailed structural interpretation of the functional roles of a68v and r124w mutations blast analysis on the 19 complete sequences present in the ncbi databases for the sarscov membrane protein suggests that the observed conservative substitution a68v is also encountered in two native viral clones ie dbjbae93405 and gbaap33701 from a structural point of view the a68v mutation occurring in a predicted protein transmembrane region should exhibit only a minor functional relevance the case is different for the r124w mutation which is outside the transmembrane segments with the arginyl residue being very conserved in all the available related sequences thus the zero shannons entropy value calculated for the totally invariant 124 position of the membrane protein sequence suggests some functional role for such rw replacement however the absence of tertiary structure information for the sarscov membrane protein prevents further functional analysis of the r124w mutation the fact that tertiary and quaternary structures can be predicted for sarscov helicase 13 allows a deeper insight into the functionstructure correlations for native and mutated forms of the viral enzyme preliminary analysis on the frequency of amino acid substitutions among the 78 complete sequences of sarscov helicase available from the ncbi databases indicates that s259 and l297 are totally conserved sites therefore it can be suggested that chemical pressure as a result of the presence of bananin in cell cultures is the only driving force for selecting the observed mutations functional validation for the helicase tertiary structure shown in fig 1 atomic coordinates are available from the protein model databank at httpwwwcaspuritpmdb under the accession number pm0076418 is provided by the observation that in studies performed in vivo s259l and l297f mutations do not interfere with viral metabolism because mutant virus variants carrying these two point mutations exhibited normal replication as in the wildtype virus 14 of primary relevance is the fact that both s259 and l297 are predicted to be outside the surface regions where dna binding ntpase activity and dimerization occur moreover it is interesting to note that l297 replaced by a phenylalanyl residue is totally buried in the helicase structure and that the conservative lf substitution 20 21 does not cause any major changes in the helicase core structure a structural comparison of molecular models obtained for wildtype sarscov helicase and the two bioactive mutants indicates how the replacement of s259 with the leucyl bulky side chain determines a volume decrease of a hydrophilic pocket present on the helicase surface this surface pocket formed by n257 and i258 backbone atoms together with s259 d260 and e261 side chains in the wildtype helicase fig 2 reduces its volume from 25345 to 21140 3 upon sl replacement in the case that the latter hydrophilic pocket of sarscov helicase is the bananin binding site the sl mutation weakens the intermolecular interaction by reducing the number of possible hydrogen bond formations electrostatic potential analysis for wildtype and s259l mutant forms of sarscov helicase was also carried out as shown in fig 3 identical surfaces charge distributions are obtained and therefore no electrostatic effects on helicase dimerization or helicasedna interaction can be attributed to the latter mutation furthermore complementarity of positive and negative charges at the dimer interface region is apparent supporting the reliability of the sarscov helicase predicted structure quantitative evaluation of s259l mutation effects on bananinsarscov helicase binding has been performed with docking simulations on wildtype and mutated forms of the viral enzyme in fig 4 the modes of bananin interaction with wildtype helicase are shown according to the results obtained from the docking simulation procedure thus it is apparent how surface pockets of native and sl mutated helicases are differently filled by bananin because binding with the small molecule involves a larger molecular interface in the case of the former helicase furthermore the absence of the s259 oh group in the mutated viral enzyme prevents the formation of one hydrogen bond with bananin accounting for the reduced strength of the bananinhelicase interaction explanations of drug activity are usually provided by conformational changes in the targeted protein or by competitive binding at the protein active site alternative mechanisms of bananin antiviral activity have to be found because its protein target at the 259 sequence position presents a fully exposed side chain and hence only limited local conformational rearrangements should result from the sl mutation moreover the fact that this mutation site is very far from the active site suggests that s259 is located either in an allosteric site of the enzyme or in a critical position for the overall protein flexibility the fact that the s259l helicase mutant is fully active is consistent with the above hypothesis proposing that this amino acid substitution which is critical for bananin binding does not interfere in the interaction of the enzyme with its natural substrates the presence of the leucyl side chain in the protein mutant appears to cause steric hindrance to bananin binding leaving the traffic of water molecules in and out from the hydrophilic pocket almost unaffected removal of such water molecules upon bananin binding could reduce helicase flexibility which a very critical feature for the activity of this class of enzymes 22 thus it can be concluded that bananin resistant sarscov variants have delineated an overall protein mutation pattern indicating the critical role of the helicase s259l mutation the possibility that bananin binding to s259 reduces the enzyme activity affecting helicase dynamics is consistent with the observed bananinresistance of sarscov variants containing s259l helicase mutations these results are useful with respect to the rational design of new antisarscov drugs in the event of a new unexpected pandemic sarscov strain gz50 23 was cultured on frhk4 cells this cell line was used to isolate and culture this virus strain from the very beginning and was considered fully permissive for viral replication 10 14 sarscov was cultured in the presence of 50 m bananin for four passages and then 100 m bananin for an additional four passages the bananinresistant virus variants were identified by a plaque assay in the presence of 100 m bananin as described previously 24 and further isolated by isolating viral plaques fourteen pairs of primers were designed according to gz50 sequence for pcr amplification of the whole genome of mutant sarscov each agarose gel purified a fragment of approximately 2 kb that was used as a template for the sequencing reaction pcr primers and sequencing primers are available upon enquiry protein sequences of sarscov helicase spp59641 spike spp59594 and membrane spp59596 proteins were retrieved from swissprot database sequence alignments of these three proteins with all sars coronavirus sequences were obtained with clustalw version 18 25 and analyzed in terms of sequence variability by using the scorecons server 19 shannons sequence entropies were considered as a quantitative measure of residue conservation the predicted structure of sarscov helicase taken from the protein data bank pdb with the pdb id code 2g1f 13 was used as the initial reference structure by using gromacs software 26 ten cycles of simulated annealing of 500 ps each were carried out to improve side chain packing and to remove most of the stereochemical ambiguities present in the selected pdb file similarly the structures of helicase sl and lf mutants were obtained and the atomic coordinates of the lowest energy structures of the wildtype form of sarscov helicase are available from the protein model databank httpwwwcaspuritpmdb under accession number pm0076418 by structural homology with other helicase dimers and helicasedna adducts pdb id codes 1uaa 3pjr and 2is1 the interface between sarscov helicase and dna has also been predicted the structure of bananin ie 13hydroxy5hydroxymethyl2methyl4pyridinyl289trioxaadamantane357triol was parameterized by using mopac2007 27 volumes of the proposed bananin binding pocket of native and mutated sarscov helicases were measured using the online tool castp httpcastengruicedu 28 adaptive poissonboltzmann solver software was used for evaluating the electrostatic properties of sarscov helicase 29 figures were prepared with pymol using pdb2pqr 30 31 
autodock 40 was used to simulate a flexible docking process for the interaction of bananin with sarscov helicase and to analyze their binding modes 32 the autodock tool adt was used to optimize ligand and protein by adding polar hydrogens and loading kollman united atoms charges as well as to perform docking calculations a grid box with dimensions 40  40  58 points was constructed around the sarscov helicase s259 residue all bond rotations and torsions for bananin were automatically set by the adt routine the lamarckian genetic algorithm procedure was employed and the docking runs were set to 250 and a maximum number of 2 500 000 energy evaluations in the docking simulations all the other parameters were set to defaults the resulting orientations with rmsd  05  were clustered  analysis of the codon usage pattern in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ye chen quanming xu xiaomin yuan xinxin li ting zhu yanmei ma ji-long chen   coronavirus cov a positive sense single-stranded rna virus was first reported in 1949 1 it belongs to the family coronaviridae and ranges from 26 to 32 kb in length making it the largest known rna virus 2 to date six covs have been identified that infect humans including human cov-229e hcov-229e human cov-oc43 hcov-oc43 severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov human cov-nl63 hcov-nl63 human cov- hku1 hcov-hku1 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 3 to date who has reported 2081 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with mers-cov including 722 deaths httpwwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven making mers-cov one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans previous studies indicated that mers-cov might have recombination events in different lineages 4 previous study also showed that the mers-cov species and hcov-229e-related lineage co-circulated in saudi arabia and they found a recombinant lineage of mers-cov that is endemic in camels 5 the recombinant viruses led to an outbreak of mers-cov in humans in 2015 6 the evolution rate and recombination rate of coronavirus is increasing such as mers-cov 4 therefore its significantly important to study the evolution and the influencing factors of mers-cov codon usage bias is an important indicator of genome evolution there are several factors that might influence the codon usage bias including natural selection mutational pressure gc content secondary protein structure and replication selective transcription 7 8 codon usage is a driving force in the evolution of small dna viruses and astroviruses 9 some studies showed that the codon usage bias of rna viruses is low such as in the equine infectious anemia virus eiav 10 zaire ebolavirus zebov 11 the n gene of rabies virus rabv 12 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv 13 a previous study indicated that different sars-cov genes had significant variation in their codon usage bias 14 however the bias is low in contrast woo et al demonstrated that cov-hku1 has a strong codon usage bias and a high nnunnc ratio of 8835 15 they also showed that both cytosine deamination and selection of cpg-suppressed clones are the major factors that shape codon bias in cov genomes 15 additionally a previous study showed that the codon usage of hcov-nl63 is characterised by a high u composition and a low gc composition which might reflect the evolutionary origin of the virus they suggested that viruses acquire some functions from other recent viral or cellular origins by gene transfer 16 during protein biosynthesis synonymous codon encoded amino acids are not used randomly and some species or genes always prefer to use of one or several particular synonymous codons which was termed as codon usage bias previous studies revealed that different genes from different species or from the same species have obvious codon usage biases 14 17 in the present study we first analysed the codon usage data of mers-cov strains the codon usage information for the mers-cov strains might provide some clues to the characteristics of the mers genome and the evolutionary history of the virus the compositions of the 32 human related mers-cov the 24 camel related mers-cov the 12 bat related mers-cov and the 3 hedgehog related mers- cov were analysed and shown in table 1 the results showed that all of the mers-cov strains and mers related strains were poor in cg and rich in au the most and least abundant bases were u and c respectively the sd value calculated for different kinds of isolates based on the nucleotide abundance supplementary table 2 showed that the value of a and u were small in the four nucleotides in the mers-cov humancamel isolates although it was lowest in the cov hedgehog isolates and largest in the cov bat isolates respectively this finding suggested that the base contents vary non-significantly between the mers-cov isolates in humancamel strains and hedgehog related cov however the cov isolates from bat showed a larger amount of variation the relative synonymous codon usage rscu value of each synonymous codon in the mers-cov genome was calculated table 2 which indicated that codon usage bias exists in the coding sequence of the mers-cov genome among codons encoding hydrophobic amino acids ccg proline 868 times and guu valine 17588 times were the least and most frequently used codons respectively meanwhile among the hydrophilic amino acids the least and most frequently used codons were cgg arginine 1160 times and gau aspartic acid 14947 times respectively we also observed that there were no synonymous codons encoding an amino acid with the same rscu value which indicated that synonymous codons are not used equally in mers-cov human isolates in addition the 18 most frequently used codons for each amino acid ended in either u or a meanwhile among the synonymous codons of the 18 amino acids 15 codons ended with u and 3 ended with a which further proved that the codon bias exists in the mers-cov human isolates to estimate the degree of codon usage bias in the mers-cov human isolates genome the effective number of codons enc value of the 32 strains were calculated the average enc value was 49816  008 which was high 45 and indicated a lower codon usage bias existed in mers-cov the relative abundance values of the 16 dinucleotides were then counted figure 1 we noted that most of the relative abundance values of the 16 dinucleotides were not in accordance with expected value ie the relative abundance value1 and 10 of the dinucleotides ag ac ug uc gg gc cc ua ga and cg have less than 1 relative abundance values however the other six dinucleotides aa au uu ca gu and cu were larger than 1 this indicated that the codon usage pattern is not equal for these dinucleotides similarly cpg had the lowest frequency while upu showed the highest frequency hence this analysis suggested that the composition of the nucleic acids affected the codon usage pattern of mers-cov to further investigate which factors account for the low codon usage bias of mers-cov and the related viruses we analysed the relationship between the enc value and the percentage of g or c in the third site of codons gc3s  in mers-cov genomes in figure 2 the solid line represents the curve produced if the codon usage is only determined by the gc3s 18 a large proportion of points lying near to the solid line on the left region of this distribution would suggest that mutational bias is the main factor determining the codon usage variation among these genes the research object was divided into four parts mers-cov human isolates mers-cov camel isolates bat related mers-cov strains and hedgehog related mers-cov strains the enc values of the coding regions of these strains were plotted against the gc3s figure 2 its shown that the observed value was smaller than the expected value which indicated that the codon usage bias patterns exist in these mers-cov strains from the resultant figure 2 the results showed that the enc values of the 32 mers-cov human isolates and 24 mers-cov camel isolates were clustered together with few changes between each other this indicated that the enc value of mers-cov human isolates or camel isolates changed little between different strains which was in accordance with the small enc sd value of these sequences we also observed that the enc values of bat and hedgehog cov isolates show slightly higher dispersion levels compared with each other however most of the plots for bat cov strains surrounded the mers-cov human and camel isolates and were not far from them the plots for the hedgehog isolates were a little further from them this analysis showed that the mutation pressure affects the codon usage bias of these strains besides mutational bias there might be additional factors that drive the codon usage variation among these genes it is generally recognized that factors such as mutational bias and natural selection pressure contribute to codon usage bias patterns 1921 thus to further investigate the possible influence of mutational pressure on the mers-cov strains codon usage bias patterns correlation analysis was performed between the codon compositions a3s u3s g3s c3s and gc3s the enc values and nucleotide compositions a u g c and gc table 3 the results revealed that most of the codon compositions correlated with the nucleotide compositions among them the u3s a3s g3s gc3s correlated significantly with almost all the nucleotide compositions a u g c and gc with p values less than 001 these results confirmed that the codon usage bias of the mers-cov strains humancamel isolates was influenced by the nucleotide compositions thus by mutational bias we observed that the data points of mers-cov human and camel isolates were clustered around the origin and did not diverge too much from each other while the related bat and hedgehog cov isolates were dispersed and diverged from each other they did not cluster around the origin and were close to either 1st or 2nd axis we then performed correlation analysis between the codon compositions and the first axis value and the second axis value revealed these compositions were correlated or significantly correlated table 3 especially for the first axis these observations reflected that 1 there was little change in the codon usage bias between the mers-cov human isolates and the mers-cov camel isolates this also proved that mutational bias contributed to the mers-cov codon usage bias this was also in accordance with the sd values of the rscu of the mers humancamel isolates 2 in addition to mutational pressure there are other factors such as natural selection which might influence the codon bias of mers-cov of humancamel isolates 3 cov of tylonyteris pipistrellus and erinaceus europaeus have distinct codon usage patterns compared with the mers-cov human camel isolates in the plots the data points were closer to the axes than to the origin 4 the codon usage bias patterns of tylonyteris pipistrellus and erinaceus europaeus cov were not only caused by mutational bias but also by natural selection pressure which might have had a larger effect than mutational bias natural selection plays an important role in codon usage bias of mers-cov and its related strains to investigate the effect of natural selection pressure on the mers-cov codon usage bias correlation analysis was studied between the gravy and aroma values and the codon compositions table 3 the results indicated that the gravy value was significantly correlated with the a3s u3s g3s and gc3s and that the aroma value was correlated significantly with the a3s u3s g3s gc3s and the enc value further confirming that natural selection influenced the mers-cov strains codon usage bias the codon usage patterns of homo sapiens camelus dromedaries taphozous pipistrellus pipistrellus erinaceus europaeus are available online httpwwwkazusaorjpcodon we obtained the rscu values of the hosts of these coronavirus strains online supplementary table 3 its revealed that among most of the preferred synonymous codons in the humancamel hosts and viral genomes of mers-cov strains there were no same codon bias however we also observed that for 10 codons encoding each amino acid c d e f h i k n q r in pipistrellus pipistrellus their preferred codons were the same as those in the mers-cov humancamel isolates 5 codons encoding each amino acid d i k n p in taphozous used the same codons and 3 codons encoding each amino acid a e p in erinaceus europaeus used the same preferred codons as the mers humancamel isolates to distinguish the roles of mutational bias and natural selection in shaping the mers codon usage patterns the gc12s the mean value of gc1s and gc2s was plotted against the gc3s figure 3a in the analysis the gc12s was correlated with the gc3s r  09525 p 00001 the correlation coefficient was 0953  4840951e-017 which indicated that the relative neutrality was 953 in other words the relative constraint of gc3s was 47 which demonstrated that mutational bias had a much larger influence than natural selection pressure on the mers-cov of humancamel isolates coding sequences to uncover the evolutionary pattern of the mers humancamel isolates codon usage biases the gc12s and gc3s were plotted against evolutionary time from 2012 to 2015 respectively figure 3b both the gc12s and the gc3s values were negatively correlated with time for gc12s r -05736 and p  00001 for gc3s r -04389 and p  00120 the change rete of the gc12s and gc3s were -00001918 and 000017765 bases per year respectively the data suggested that the gc content at all three codon positions decreased as the evolution of mers-cov humancamel isolates additionally the evolution rate of the gc3s was very similar to that of the gc12s indicating that compared with the natural selection pressure the mutational bias played an increasingly important role in shaping the mers humancamel codon usage pattern then the possible connection between the codon usage pattern and the evolution of sequencesgenes were further investigated here the first three axes from the correspondence analysis ca were used to provide a 3-dimensional visualization of the relationships among the sequences colours were used to identify sequences with different features eg viral host and year of isolation in the analysis the phylogenetic tree analysis which performed by the previous report method found that these 54 mers-covs were divided into two clades named clade a and clade b supplementary figure 1 and the results are consistent with previous study 4 in this analysis the different open reading frames orfs of the whole genome and different genes of mers-cov strains were used figure 4 for the m gene the gene changes seemed to be random which indicated that evolution had little effect on the m gene figure 4a for the orf1ab gene there was a clear evolutionary trend over time especially for the 2015 isolates of mers-cov figure 4c for the n gene mutation was the main influencing factor figure 4b the result for the s gene was similar to the orf1ab gene figure 4d both evolution and mutation affected the codon usage pattern with mutation having the larger effect obviously the aggregationdispersion states of the plots that were composed using different genes are different to the plots using the whole genome in figure 4e thus the different genes contributed to the mers-cov codon usage bias by different degrees the genetic code is degenerate as multiple codons code for a single amino acid most organisms exhibit differences in base composition and significant codon bias unequal usage of synonymous codons generally mutations leading to change in amino acids are studied as a measure of selection synonymous mutations can change the base composition of genes without altering the corresponding proteins intuitively synonymous mutations appear to be neutral or near-neutral in their effects however their evolutionary consequences are being recognised increasingly 2226 studies show that codon bias and synonymous mutations are under weak selection driving evolution in various organisms 2729 genes that are enriched for preferred codons are known to have higher translational efficiency it has been shown in other host-pathogen systems such as bacteriabacteriophages that long-term co-evolution has resulted in some genes of bacteriophages being enriched in the codons preferred by their respective bacterial hosts 30 a balance between selection mutation and genetic drift maintains the codon bias in the host and the pathogens thus studies revealing determinants of the bias and its dynamics are central to our understanding of hostpathogen evolution 31 32 previous studies has been revealed that compared with dna viruses the evolution of rna viruses was faster such as the evolution of influenza virus 33 34 coronaviruses 4 35 codon usage analysis is a serviceable and well-established method to study the codon usage patterns of different organisms such as the studies of codon usage of vp2 gene of canine parvovirus 36 and the n gene of rabies viruses 12 recently the high casefatality ratio of mers-cov infection has attracted considerable attention in the worldwide although the genome sequence of mers-cov has been published and many studies have been performed after each outbreak 4 6 37 38 little genomic analysis was studied on this virus to further understand the genomics of the mers strains we performed codon usage analysis of the mers-cov and its related strains investigating the extent and causes of codon usage bias is essential for research focused on viral evolution and transmission to investigate the factors leading to the mers-cov and mers related strains codon usage patterns several analytical methods were used in our study first the rscu value of the mers strains were calculated the results indicated that codon usage bias exists and that the mers preferred codons almost all end in u with a proportion of 1518 the codon usage bias was further confirmed by the mean enc value of 4982 for comparison the mean enc value for other studied viruses were porcine epidemic diarrhea virus mean enc4791 13 sars mean enc  489939 foot and mouth disease virus mean enc  5142 40 h5n1 influenza a virus mean enc  5091 41 duck enteritis virus mean enc  5217 42 classical swine fever virus mean enc  517 43 and hepatitis a virus mean enc  397844 an enc value greater than 45 is considered as a lower codon usage bias the mean enc value for mers-cov strains was a little higher than most viruses and was higher than 45 therefore the codon usage bias of mers is relatively low the codon studies on coronavirus has been reported previously 39 45 however the enc of mers-cov was higher than the sars cov additionally in this study we discovered that other than mutation pressure natural selection as well as the abundance of dinucleotide also contribute to the evolution of mers-cov a low biased codon usage pattern might allow the virus make use of several codons for each amino acid and might be beneficial for viral replication and translation in the host cells the relative abundance of dinucleotides also correlated with the first two principal components in the pca analysis the result showed that there was an obvious distinction in the dinucleotide usage cpg dinucleotides had the lowest abundance which indicated that mers-cov might have the ability adapt to the host when the enc values were plotted against gc3s the codon usage bias in mers-cov was identified if the codons of mers-cov strains were completely random with bias supplied in the standard curve all of the data points would lie upon the expected curve however figure 2 showed that the data points representing the enc value for each mers-cov strain were lower than the expected curve this indicated that there were codon usage bias in the codon usage pattern and other factors influenced the mers codon usage pattern additionally in the enc-plot analysis it was discovered that bat cov isolates show slightly higher dispersion levels and near to the distribution of human related and camel related covs which might due to the consequence of the bat was the natural host of coronavirus generally the main causes of codon usage bias are considered to be mutational bias and natural selection pressure which are the two main forces involved in shaping the synonymous codon usage pattern of rna viruses to confirm the possible role of mutational bias in the codon usage pattern we performed correlation analysis between the nucleotide content and the codon composition the strong correlation between these two variables except in the c3s and a u g c showed that mutational bias contributed to the codon usage pattern a significant correlation was shown between the gc3s values and the nucleotide content table 3 which also revealed the importance of mutational bias the role of mutational bias was further demonstrated by the pca analysis which showed that the first and second components were significantly correlated with the nucleotide content for the mers humancamel isolates a weak codon usage bias might be caused by natural selection when the viruses adapt to the host cells in contrast a strong bias caused by nature selection in the other cov strains of mers related isolates were also observed with natural selection pressure the rate of codon change might be slightly larger compared with the data whose plots are clustered close to the origin to further determine the roles of mutation natural selection and evolution in the mers-cov strains ca was performed ca indicated that both mutation and natural selection affect the codon usage pattern with mutation having a more important role this implied that there is some correlation between the different isolates next we investigated the role of natural selection in shaping the mers-cov strains codon usage patterns by investigating the relationships between the gravy value the aroma value and nucleotide content and the high codon adaptation index cai value compared with the host genome codon usage pattern the results showed that mutation bias was more important than natural selection pressure in neutral analysis in mers-cov humancamel isolates which agreed with the result of the pca in addition gene function the evolution factor and the different hosts were also identified as factors that are influential in shaping the mers-cov codon usage pattern while the geographical distribution had no influence on the mers-cov codon usage bias in summary our study identified that variation in the mers-cov codon usage pattern is low two main factors mutational bias and natural selection pressure have contributed to the codon usage pattern with the former having a larger effect in mers-cov humancamel isolates and the latter playing a more critical role in the cov strains of bathedgehog isolates there was a significant variation in codon usage bias between mers-cov humancamel isolates and the covs isolated from bats and hedgehogs the codon usage bias of mers-cov was different in the isolates of the latter two hosts in which nature selection pressure played an important role in the codon usage bias we also observed a difference between the human mers-cov isolates and the bathedgehog isolates in their use of the most preferred synonymous codon however among the cov isolates from bats or hedgehogs the use of the same synonymous codons as their hosts was highly consistent this may hint that coronavirus does not spread so widely in humans in the evolutionary process natural selection pressure plays an increasing role in addition other factors such as gene function and the different outbreak times also influenced the codon usage bias to some extent however the geographical distribution did not have a significant role in the mers-cov codon usage bias in conclusion this first systemic analysis of the codon usage patterns of mers-cov strains and the related strains will be beneficial to further studies examining this important zoonotic pathogen the complete genomes of different mers and mers related isolates were retrieved from genbank httpwwwncbinlmnihgovnuccoretermmiddleeastrespiratorysyndromecoronavirus3bcompletegenome and httpwwwncbinlmnihgov then the sequences were selected according to their geographical distribution the isolation date and the host species 4650 to analyse the codon usage bias of mers strains we selected only those viruses with complete genome and complete cds information detailed information about the 71 mers and mers related strains including their accession number the date they were isolated and their place of isolation listed in the supplementary materials supplementary table 1 the edited data were then aligned using the mega7 the bioedit version 7090 sequence analysis program and the clustal w method for all selected and analysed sequences short 300bp of the corresponding gene and abnormal sequences were removed from the datasets and only six viral genes were studied because the short length and insufficient codon usage diversity of the other genes might have biased the results the six genes analysed were the e m n s orf1ab and orf3 and all these genes were classified according to their viral isolation date and location the nucleotide content a u g and c of each mers and mers related strain was analysed using bioedit the nucleotide composition of the synonymous codon position of each codon gc1s gc2s gc3s was calculated using the cusp program online httpembosstoulouseinrafrcgi-binembosscusp the a3s u3s g3s gc and gc3s were calculated using the codon w program online httpmobylepasteurfrcgi-binportalpyformscodonw the rscu values were first proposed in 1986 51 to standardize the codon usage of those amino acid encoded by different codons the rscu value is independent of the amino acid composition and has been used widely to estimate the codon usage bias among genes a higher rscu value means that the codon is used more frequently or has a higher codon usage bias if the rscu value of a specific codon is higher than 10 it is considered to be a positive codon usage bias while the rscu value is less than 10 it is considered to be a negative codon usage bias the enc value is not influenced by the amino acid composition or the gene length in the enc analysis an enc value is given to each codon the enc value ranges from 20 to 61 in contrast to the rscu value a higher enc value correlates to a weaker codon usage bias if the codon usage of one gene is completely random and unbiased then the expected enc value is calculated from the gc3s 18
enc2s29s21-s2
where the s value is the gc3s content of each codon when the expected enc value is plotted against the gc3s value an expected curve is formed a dot located on the curve is regarded as unbiased the relative abundance of dinucleotides were also correlated with the first two principal axes there are two explanations for the low frequency of cpgs the first one is that cytosine c is the methylation signal and the methylation of c results in a decrease in the level transcription and an increase of the mutation frequency thus for codons such as xca xctu xcc and xcg which encode the same amino acid the nucleotide c with an a u or c tag after is more favourable than g the specific oligodeoxynucleotide of the core unmethylated cpg dinucleotides can also stimulate a host immune response to the exogenous dna or biological reducing the cpg dinucleotide content of codons allows the virus to avoid stimulating the host immune system as far as possible which is beneficial to the hosts in vivo survival 52 a low frequency of the cpg dinucleotides also affects the viral codon usage pattern software to perform ca is available online at additional strategy for codon usage httpmobylepasteurfrcgi-binportalpyformscodonw this study also used an bias for mers-cov virus strains using the ca based on rscu value the patterns and trends of codon usage were observed and the differences and evolution trends of the different strains were analysed the effectiveness of this type of analysis was demonstrated by the known evolution of viral replication capacity as well as revealing a new trend the results also showed that the pattern of this ca could form a valuable tool for rapid classification and identification of any unusual patterns of newly isolated viruses using the rscu values of the virus sequences of different ca groups provided an analysis and visualization of these data for large multidimensional data sets ca allows the reduction of the dimensionality of the data to effectively visualize and capture most of the changes that can occur 53 pca is a common statistical method used to explain the codon usage of a specific gene in the analysis the rscu value of each codon is explained by a 59-dimensional space and transformed into unrelated factors in this model pca can determine any major variation from the rscu value of each codon using both the pca and correlation analysis the factors influencing the codon usage bias can be determined effectively 13 rscu values of the 59 relevant codons were determined for all the sequences also studied in this work the codon cai is one of the most widespread methods used to analyse codon usage bias resulting from natural selection pressure in represents the adaption of the virus to the host the cai value ranged from 0 to 1 a higher cai value indicates stronger adaption to the host the codon usage patterns of the different host animals were obtained using an online tool httpwwwkazusaorjpcodon to estimate the codon adaption of the mers to the host the cai value is calculated using the caical software httpgenomesurvescaical in the analysis the synonymous codon usage pattern of the viral host were deposited as the reference and the cai values of the mers and mers related strains were calculated after comparison with the reference from the different hosts the hydropathicity and aromaticity of a single gene product are thought to be the result of translation selection resulting from natural selection 54 herein the gravy and aroma score of each gene product were obtained using the codon w program version 142 to reflect the hydropathicity and aromaticity respectively a higher gravy or aroma score means that the protein is more hydrophobic or aromatic respectively neutral evolution analysis is used to estimate the varying role of mutational pressure and natural selection on the mers and mers related strains in this analysis the synonymous codon gc12s value was plotted against gc3s value 55 to study the evolution characteristics of the mutation pressure and natural selection regression line in the mers strains the g12s or the g3s value was plotted against evolutionary time respectively the evolution speed resulting from the mutation pressure and the natural selection pressure was expressed as the slope of a simple regression line correlation analysis was performed using statistical software version 20 and graphpad prism 60 for one-way analysis of variance anova correlation analysis and to draw the figures the 3d graph was created using sigma plot 125  date of origin of the sars coronavirus strains hongchao lu yi zhao jingfen zhang yuelan wang wei li xiaopeng zhu shiwei sun jingyi xu lunjiang ling lun cai dongbo bu runsheng chen   a new respiratory infectious epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome sars broke out and spread throughout the world affecting over 8000 individuals in 32 countries12 in response to this outbreak a global network of international collaborating laboratories was immediately sponsored and established by world health organization who to facilitate the identification of the causative agent of sars by now the putative pathogen of sars has been identified by experimental proof and by kochs postulates as a new coronavirus a single positive-strand rna virus 3-5 the whole genome of sars coronavirus was first sequenced by the british columbia centre for disease control cdc in canada on 23 april 2003 6 and subsequently a total of 16 sars coronavirus strains isolated from hanoi mainland china hong kong singapore and taiwan were sequenced within short time78 phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic studies based on these genomic sequences indicate that the sars coronavirus is distinct from any of the previously characterized coronaviruses epidemiological investigations further indicate the sars coronavirus strains may be divided into two different genotypes9 rna viruses commonly have a high rate of genetic mutation by which the viruses escape from host defence and evolve into novel viral strains it is therefore important to know the mutation rate of the sars coronavirus as it spreads through the population moreover finding a date for the last common ancestor of sars coronavirus strains would be useful for understanding the circumstances surrounding the emergence of the sars pandemic and the rate at which sars coronavirus diverge many attempts have been made to extrapolate the age of the common ancestor of sequenced genomes most of them are based on accurate phylogenetic tree reconstructions which demand a large amount computation because of their application of the maximum likelihood strategy common for these methods is that it is critical to choose a sequence as the root of the phylogenetic tree korber et al 10 implemented a parsimonious strategy which used the consensus sequence including the most common bases appearing in strains as the ancestral sequence among the 16 full-length sars coronavirus genomes we selected 6 strains for which the accurate date of host death is known and on which our modelling was based our model performed calculation under two hypotheses which are commonly adopted and have lead to accurate prediction in the study of hiv-1 virus 10 first nucleotide variation of these strains occurred by independent mutations at random positions in a single ancestral sequence second there exist a molecular clock and a constant rate of evolution in addition we simplified the calculation by neglecting trivial non-linear effects of multi-mutation for a base ie there has only been one mutation for a base at a specific position of all the sequences during sars infection time this simplification can be justified by further discussion see additional file 1 for an ancestor sequence s0 of a strain s we can deduce for the assumptions above that eds0 s  kt - t0 where ds0 s is difference of the two sequences as depicted by hamming distance t0 is the date of the last ancestor t is the date of host death as an estimate of sampling date and k is the evolution rate constant the formula gives the expectation of sequence differences in proportion to the time of evolution if s0 is the last common ancestor of s and s then we have edss  eds0s  eds0s fig 1a the equation takes this form under the simplification that along the total of the infection paths of the two sequences mutation at any specific point of the sequences could at most only occur once thus edss  kt  t - 2t0 the last common ancestor s0 of all the sequences is the root of the hidden phylogenetic tree with the strains as nodes from the time t0 the sequences should at least evolve along two different routes therefore there should be a partition of the strains into b and b such that every pair of strains s  b and s  b should share the root of the tree as their last common ancestor fig 1b ie for each pair s s edss should be linear to t  t with same parameter t0 therefore we can implement the least square method to estimate k and t0 from the dataset since the real partition cannot be known in advance we carried out calculations for all of the possible partitions of these 6 strains for each division we use the estimated k to calculate the possible t0ss of each sequence pair the division with the minimum variance of t0ss is taken as our best solution to the problem and the corresponding k as an estimation of the mutation rate to analyze how the parameters affect the results and support our fitting method the monte carlo method was employed at first we produced a phylogenetic tree see fig 3c and a table of parameters see table 3 including the evolution rate and the times of the sequences from the time of the last common ancestor s0 of the other sequences every base of a given sequence has the possibility to mutate over time according to the given evolution rate so the other sequences included intermediate sequences i and final sequences f can be obtained in steps in the stimulation according to the given phylogenetic tree and the time parameters after the sequences were obtained we used our fitting method to get the evolution rate without including the hidden parameters by analysis of the estimated k from the data we can get to know how the parameters affect our fitting results and the quality of our method of the 16 sars coronavirus strains submitted to genbank before june 2003 6 had accurate date of host death recorded we chose these 6 to estimate the last common ancestor and the mutation rate of the sars coronavirus table 1 we performed the calculation and the fitting result of the best division see table 2 is shown in fig 2 including the differences between sequences dss versus the time factor t  t the evolution rate k was estimated to be 016 baseday which is similar to the reported evolution rate of hiv-1 virus 10 the date of the last common ancestor t0 was found to be about august or september 2002 which is also in accordance with the epidemic investigations finding that the first verifiable sars case was reported as early as on november 11 2002 we validated our estimation of the evolutionary rate by grouping strains according to the estimated date of their pair wise last common ancestor applying the estimated k  016 we can determine a date t0i j of the last common ancestor for each pair si sj by edss  kti  tj - 2t0i j table 2 and then divide the 6 into two groups g1  bj01 bj02 gz01 and g2  tor2sin2500us it is apparent that every two members in g1 have a last common ancestor with a date t0i j  0 while every two members in g2 have corresponding t0i j  0 this would imply that the strains in g1 have a more recent last common ancestor than those in g2 this partition of strains was supported by ruan et al 9 analysis by monte carlo method was employed to test our fitting method and explain why the error of the evolution rate and time of last common ancestor was so large in our prediction in a simulation of the simplified evolution model sequences were generated according to a given phylogenetic tree with parameters including evolution rate and times for each sequence two sets of parameters were used for a common phylogenetic tree the evolution rate kept constant while time parameters differed see fig 3c and table 3 in model 1 there is a narrow time distribution two month of final sequences while model 2 had a wider time distribution of five months hundreds of iterations of sequence data from the stimulation were given according to the parameters for each result we could get estimated parameters by our fitting method the estimated k distribution of the results shown in fig 3 is in support of our fitting method as in both models the estimates for the evolutionary rate converged on the set parameter 02 model 2 with wide time distribution had a narrower distribution of k which indicates the fitted parameter has a smaller error the difference between the two models hints a narrow sampling time window as a partially explanation of the large error on the estimated k for the real data ideally an estimation of evolution rate and the date of last ancestor for the sars coronavirus should be based on sampling dates with possible adjustments for culturing time and conditions as such data were neither included in the submissions to genbank nor obtainable by direct contacts to the sequencing labs we were left to choose between less ideal age estimates for the strains such as date of host death sequencing date or submission date to genbank sequencing dates were no more available than sampling dates and for some groups several sequences were submitted to genbank on the same date in addition large part of the genbank sequence were submitted long after june 2003 when no or very few sars patient were available for sampling also rendering submission date a not very accurate estimate for strain time this basically left us with little other choice than to accept the date of host death as the most accurate available estimate for the age of each strain assuming that in most cases samples were taken a few days before to just after the death of the host we think these dates represent acceptable though not ideal estimates of the endpoint of strain time in summary certain inherent features of the situation around the sars epidemic prevented our method from rendering more accurate estimates first as national and international efforts fortunately succeeded in stemming the spread of fledgling epidemic by summer 2003 all the samples used to obtain the 16 sequences were collected within a relatively short period of time two months which makes the error of ds0 si is relative large second because the date of host death is not good reflection of real time of sequences the error of time is quite large third as useful time data for the submitted sequences were scarce the subset of sequences available for modelling was too small finally as data on pre-sequencing culturing times and conditions have not been made available differences in evolutions rates between in vivo and in vitro conditions cannot be estimated and the basic assumption that only a constant evolution rate may not be completely valid a more accurate model considering two evolution rate parameters may produce a more accurate estimation particularly on a larger dataset with accurate sampling and sequencing times we have proposed a mathematical model to estimate the evolution rate of the sars coronavirus genome as well as the time of the last common ancestor of the various sars coronavirus strains the method is simple to implement and avoids the difficulty and subjectivity of choosing the root of phylogenetic tree based on 6 strains with accurate dates of host death we estimated a time of the last common ancestor which is coincident with epidemic investigations and an evolution rate in the same range as that reported for the hiv-1 virus none declared lu and

human coronavirus oc43 modulate disease in balbc mice from encephalitis to flaccid paralysis and demyelination hlne jacomy julien st-jean r lodie brison gabriel marceau marc desforges pierre talbot j  the etiology of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system remains unknown and likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggering factors given that exposure to numerous infectious pathogens occurs during childhood and that some viral infections can lead to neurodegeneration and demyelination it is conceivable that some viruses may act as triggering factors in neuropathogenesis we have previously shown that the prototype oc43 strain of the common cold-associated human respiratory coronavirus has the capacity to infect human neuronal and glial cells and does persist in human brains moreover it has neuroinvasive properties in susceptible balbc mice where it leads to a chronic encephalitis with accompanying disabilities here we show that mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein reproducibly acquired during viral persistence in human neural cell cultures led to a drastically modified virus-induced neuropathology in balbc mice characterized by flaccid paralysis and demyelination even though infection by both mutated and wild-type viruses led to neuroinflammation the modified neuropathogenesis induced by the mutated virus was associated with increased viral spread and significantly more cd4 and cd8 t-lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system as well as significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin il-6 and the chemokine ccl2 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 moreover recombinant virus harboring the s glycoprotein mutations retained its neurotropism productively infecting neurons therefore interaction of a human respiratory coronavirus with the central nervous system may modulate virus and host factors resulting in a modified neuropathogenesis in genetically susceptible individuals journal of neurovirology 2010 16 279-293  coronaviruses form a family of enveloped viruses responsible for respiratory enteric and neurological diseases buchmeier and lane 1999 myint 1994  human coronaviruses hcovs are ubiquitous respiratory pathogens known to cause infections of the upper respiratory tract of the common cold type but have also been linked to other type of diseases  indeed we have reported that hcov can infect and persist in human neural cells arbour et al 1999a arbour et al  1999b bonavia et al 1997  can activate human glial cells to produce proinflammatory mediators edwards et al 2000  and persist in human brains arbour et al 2000  moreover the oc43 prototype strain hcov-oc43 induces encephalitis in susceptible mice with neurons being the main target of infection jacomy et al 2006 jacomy and talbot 2003  the coronavirus spike glycoprotein s is responsible for attachment to the host cell receptor studies with recombinant murine hepatitis virus mhv-jhm bearing a modified s protein have identified this viral spike glycoprotein as a major determinant of neurovirulence phillips et al 2001  interestingly neurovirulence was associated with accelerated spread throughout the brain and a heightened innate immune response characterized by brain-infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages suggesting an immunopathogenic component to neurovirulence iacono et al 2006  of immediate relevance to the present study neurovirulence of hcov-oc43 in mice was associated with mutations in the viral s glycoprotein butler et al 2006  we have reported that persistent hcov-oc43 infections of human neuronal and glial cell lines led to the appearance of point mutations in the s glycoprotein gene st-jean et al 2006b  interestingly five mutations were predominantly and reproducibly observed and four of them d 24 y s 83 t h 183 r and y 241 h are located in the putative receptor-binding domain based on homology with the s protein of mhv importantly these four mutations were the only ones that had appeared in the s glycoprotein gene after 35 passages in the human u-87mg astrocytic cell line st-jean et al 2006b  the present study was undertaken to investigate the potential biological significance of these four viral s mutations in a murine model of hcov-oc43induced neuropathology our results demonstrate that these mutations are sufficient to significantly increase neurovirulence and modify neuropathology into a flaccid paralysis associated with eventual demyelination in balbc mice this modified pathology was associated with increased viral spread and expression of il-6 and ccl2 in the spinal cord and a transient t-lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system cns to investigate the potential biological relevance of the four viral mutations d 24 y s 83 t h 183 r and y 241 h located in the hcov-oc43 putative cell receptor-binding domain detected in the viral s gene after 35 passages of the persistently infected human u-87mg astrocytic cell line they were introduced into the infectious cdna clone of hcov-oc43 st-jean et al 2006a to yield a recombinant mutated virus rocu s24-241 figure 1  which was compared with a recombinant wild-type prototype virus designated rocatcc balbc mice were infected by each recombinant virus and survival curves were established for mice infected with rocu s24-241 paralysis caused by s-mutated human coronavirus first week post infection by rocatcc mice ate and drank normally and did not loose weight compared to control mice figure 2a  at around 9 days post infection dpi rocatcc-infected mice started to present ruffled fur and a humped-back posture 2 to 3 days later  figure 2c  between 11 and 13 dpi roc atcc-infected mice either recovered rapidly and showed no further symptoms of encephalitis or became inactive and started to die at 13 dpi  figure 2b  this reproduces our earlier report using the original wild-type prototype virus strain atcc vr-759 jacomy and talbot 2003  on the other hand mice infected with rocu s24-241 presented the first clinical signs of disease more rapidly than for rocatcc as they started to lose weight  figure 2a  and die between 7 to 11 dpi  figure 2b  during this period mice showed loss of tonicity or paralysis of the tail moreover abnormal locomotion was evident during the acute phase of roc u s24-241 virus-initiated pathology starting at around 9 dpi motor disabilities could already be observed  figure 2c  lower panel as mice presented an abnormal paw position and loss of strength indicative of neuropathology between 10 to 15 dpi mice presented flaccid hindlimb paralysis survival rates were more than 3 times higher in rocatcc-infected mice compared to rocu s24-241  indeed 70 of mice survived to infection by roc atcc whereas only 20 survived to infection by rocu s24-241  figure 2b  therefore the introduction of four mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein was sufficient to confer drastically increased neurovirulence to hcov-oc43 as for balbc mice rocu s24-241 infection of the cns was more severe and rapid than rocatcc infection in c57bl6 mice data not shown however although clinical symptoms observed in balbc mice infected with rocu s24-241 differed from those in rocatcc-infected mice no such difference could be observed in c57bl6 infected mice between the two viruses as only encephalitis symptoms were observed data not shown therefore as the main goal of the present study was to characterize the modified neuropathology induced by the mutated rocu s24-241 compared to wildtype rocatcc virus and because functional deficits associated with a modulated neuropathology were not different after infection by both viruses in c57bl6 mice all the remaining experiments were only performed in balbc mice as we have previously reported that wildtype hcov-oc43 is neuroinvasive in mice spreading rapidly from the periphery to the cns st-jean et al 2004  the neuroinvasiveness of both recombinant viruses was similarly investigated intranasal in inoculations of either of the two recombinant viruses were performed in 14-day-old balbc mice and viral replication in the cns and mice survival was monitored following inhalation with either virus replication was followed and our results indicate that the neuroinvasive properties of both recombinant viruses were maintained data not shown increased neurovirulence does not correlate with increased infectious virus replication in the cns but appears to correlate with increased viral spread intracerebral infections of balbc mice with either of the two recombinant viruses were performed to determine whether the extent of virus replication in the brain and spinal cord correlated with virulence both infectious recombinant viruses started to be quantifiable in mouse brain at 3 dpi and remained detectable during the first 2 weeks of infection as no more infectious paricles were detectable after 15 dpi  figure 3a  for both viruses the highest level of infectious virions were found between 7 to 9 dpi and 100 of mice were positive for infectious virus between 5 and 11 dpi indicating that the two recombinant viruses replicated to similar extents in the brain  figure 3a  on the other hand infectious roc u s24-241 virus appeared more rapidly in the spinal cord illustrating the increased viral spread of this virus compared to rocatcc indeed infectious rocu s24-241 virus was detectable in the spinal cord as early as 5 dpi and peaked at 7 dpi whereas this was delayed by 2 days for rocatcc  figure 3b  interestingly the peak of infectious roc atcc particles was at least 10 times lower than for rocu s24-241 in the spinal cord as for the brain infectious virus was always undetectable after the second week post infection for both recombinants  figure 3b  as we have previously reported that wild-type hcov-oc43 rna could be detected in infected mice for 2 weeks after infection using a regular polymerase chain reaction pcr assay and several months after infection using a sensitive nested reverse transcriptase rt-pcr technique jacomy et al 2006  this fact was similarly investigated for both recombinant viruses we could reproducibly detect viral rna of both viruses by standard pcr for 2 weeks after infection and by nested pcr for several months post infection data not shown illustrating that both recombinant viruses had conserved the capacity to establish a long-term persistent infection in mice jacomy et al 2006  on the other hand differences in infectious virus titers were observed in spinal cords where rocu s24-241 virus spread more rapidly and to infectious titers ten times higher than rocatcc at 7 dpi when viruses reached their peak of replication mouse brains were extracted and the viral s gene was sequenced to investigate whether the four mutations in rocu s24-241 were conserved and that no new mutations had appeared the four s mutations introduced into rocu s24-241 were indeed conserved after several cycles of replication in mouse cns and no new s mutations were found data not shown spread of viral antigens in the neurons of the cns innate immune response and axonal damage following infection histological examination of infected mice revealed that the infected regions were similar following infection by both viruses in the brain figure 4  as the spread of virus detected by the presence of viral antigens was similar at 5 dpi indeed for both recombinant viruses the dentate gyrus dg and ca3 layer of the hippocampus were heavily positive for viral antigens representing the main area of infection whereas other regions of the cortex also contained viral antigens arrows in figure 4  upper panel at higher magnification the hippocampus presented numerous cells positive for viral antigens for both recombinant viruses left panels for roc atcc or right panels for rocu s24-241  on sagittal sections increased spread of rocu s24-241 virus into pons and medulla oblongata of the brainstem was observed as compared to rocatcc  figure 5a -f at 9 dpi figure 4  staining for viral expression revealed an extensive spread of viral antigens throughout the brain similar for both viruses whereas the neurons remained the main target cell for infection as illustrated at higher magnification in figure 4 left panels for rocatcc or right panels for rocu s24-241  when virus had spread to all regions of the brain activation of microglial cells and astrocytes was evident in all infected regions  figure 4  9 dpi as illustrated at 9 dpi even though no precise quantification was performed a slight increase in activation of microglia mac-2 panels and astrocytes gfap panels could easily be observed in brains of roc u s24-241 -compared to rocatcc-infected mice as illustrated in the panels of lower magnification  figure 4  analysis of the spinal cord at 9 dpi  figure 6  revealed that viral antigens could be observed in neurons of the grey matter for both recombinant viruses and that these infected cells were more numerous in rocu s24-241 -infected mice  figure 6a and b and at higher magnification c and d consistent with the increased infectious titer of rocu s24-241 detected in the spinal cord  figure 3b  at the same time infiltrating mononuclear immune cells were observed in infected regions of the spinal cord and these mononuclear cells were more abundant following rocu s24-241 infection  figure 6f  compared to rocatcc infection  figure 6e  moreover as previously reported jacomy and talbot 2003  neuronophagia was also observed in the spinal cord of infected animals at 11 dpi infectious viruses  figure 3b  and viral antigens  figure 6g and h were still present in the spinal cord even though flaccid paralysis was only associated with rocu s24-241 infection axonal damage could be observed following infection by both viruses as observed by the detection of dephosphorylated neurofilament  figure 6i and j whereas the majority of axons exhibited normal neurofilament distribution  figure 6k and l to define the kinetics of t-cell infiltration into the cns following infection mononuclear cells were isolated from the cns of sham and roc-infected mice at 5 9 and 13 dpi and stained with antibodies to cd4  or cd8  t-lymphocyte subsets as expected cd4  and cd8  t-lymphocytes could not be detected in the brains of control sham animals however mice infected by either recombinant virus demonstrated a robust cns t-cell response  figure 7a  lymphocytes were detected in the cns of both roc-infected animals at 5 dpi and mononuclear cell infiltration increased between 9 and 13 dpi  figure 7b and c the frequency of cd4  and cd8  t cells peaked at 13 dpi in brain following infection by both viruses furthermore a major difference between the two recombinant viruses was observed at 9 dpi where cd4  t-cell infiltration was significantly higher following rocu s24-241 infection compared to roc atcc  figure 7b and c congruent with the kinetics of viral infection figure 3  cd4  t-lymphocytes increased more rapidly in brains and spinal cords of rocu s24-241 -infected animals reaching their maximal level at 9 dpi as compared to 13 dpi for roc atcc-infected animals  figure 7b  the increase in cd4  t-cell infiltration in the cns during infection suggests that these cells play an important role in virus clearance indeed comparison between the cd4  t-cell frequency  figure 7b  and infectious virus titers  figure 4a  revealed an abrupt decline in infectious virus concomitant with an increasing frequency of cd4  t-lymphocytes in the cns a more tenuous correlation was observed for cd8  t cells following infection  figure 7c  as cytokines and chemokines produced by either cns cells or infiltrating immune cells influence the acquired immune response we measured spinal cord levels of several cytokines and chemokines at the initial phase of virus infection 5 dpi during the acute virus replication phase 9 dpi and during the viral clearance phase 13 dpi figure 8  we targeted the spinal cord because viral replication at that site paralysis caused by s-mutated human coronavirus h jacomy et al was faster and reached higher levels in rocu s24-241than in rocatcc-infected mice and rocu s24-241infected animals presented motor disabilities related to spinal cord dysfunction such as paralysis at 5 dpi most proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were present at very low levels in spinal cord tissue and were comparable to control sham mice figure 8  at 9 dpi increased levels of figure 4 histological examination of virus spread in the brain at 5 dpi viral spread was similar for both recombinant viruses virus was found mainly in the hippocampi more specifically in dentate gyrus dg and in the ca3 layer of the hippocampus top arrow in upper panel patches of infected cells were seen in the cortical area bottom arrow in upper panel higher magnification shows that neurons remained the main target of infection by both viruses at 5 dpi activated microglia were not visible absence of mac-2 staining and astrocytes appeared normal gfap staining at 9 dpi infectious virus was found throughout the brain in the hippocampus infected neurons were now mainly localized in the ca1 layer activated microglia mac-2 stained and activated astrocytes increased gfap staining were evident in the dg and ca3 layer of the hippocampus for both viruses but the ca1 layer also showed signs of glial activation following rocu s24-241 infection magnification for hippocampus pictures 40 and magnification 200 paralysis caused by s-mutated human coronavirus proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-2 il-1a and -1b tumor necrosis factor tnf-a and interferon ifn-g were detected in mice infected by both recombinant viruses as compared to control sham mice elevated levels of il-6 were detected in spinal cords of mice infected by both recombinants at 9 dpi but was statistically higher in rocu s24-241than in rocatcc-infected mice most of the cytokine levels returned to normal levels at 13 dpi compared to levels measured at 5 dpi except for il-1a and -1b as well as tnf-a which remained higher than at 5 dpi the ifn-g-inducible protein 10 ip-10cxcl10 and ccl5 rantes were drastically increased between 5 and 9 dpi after infection by both viruses on the other hand even though infection by both viruses also induced an increased production of ccl2 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 this increase was significantly higher after infection by rocu s24-241 at 9 dpi the increase in the amount of ccl2 correlated with the more pronounced infiltration of t cells in the spinal cord following rocu s24-241 infection  figure 7b and c during the acute phase following rocu s24-241 infection mice presented tail paralysis and hind limb disabilities starting as soon as 9 dpi  figure 2c  lower panel but demyelination in the spinal cord was never observed at such early time post infection at around 15 dpi based on the observations representative of three independent experiments among the 20 of mice that survived 50 recovered from paralysis and appeared to walk normally whereas the other 50 still presented flaccid paralysis of their hindlimbs  figure 9c  at 1 month post infection histological examination of the spinal cord of mice infected by rocu s24-241 revealed plaques of demyelination in animals that remained paralyzed and in animals that suffered transient paralysis and had recovered to a nonparalyzed clinical status  figure 9b  figure 9b  similar to control sham animals  figure 9a  therefore mice that eventually presented demyelination in the spinal cord had all presented some sort of flaccid paralysis at a certain point in time before the demyelination lesions appeared at 1 month post infection activated macrophagesmicroglia were colocalized with the foci of demyelination following infection by rocu s24-241  figure 9e and f given that the outcome of a viral infection depends on both host and viral factors the aim of the present study was to understand how four mutations in the s protein of a human coronavirus which appeared reproducibly during persistent infection of human neural cells could modulate the neurovirulence of the virus and the neuroinflammation process of the host in relation to the evolution of the virus-induced neurological disease in susceptible balbc mice rocu s24-241 infection of the cns was more severe and rapid than roc atcc infection indeed the rocu s24-241 virus was more virulent than wild-type rocatcc virus exhibiting a 3 to 4 log unit decrease in the intracerebral 50 lethal dose ld 50  in balbc mice to obtain the same survival rate data not shown as also reported for mhv phillips et al 1999  increased neurovirulence of rocu s24-241 was associated with accelerated spread throughout the cns however unlike mhv where demyelinating strains differ in their neural cell tropism as compared to nondemyelinating strains das sarma et al 2008  the difference between the capacities of rocatcc and roc u s24-241 to induce paralysis and eventually demyelination was not associated by a fundamental change in their cellular tropism or the topography of the infection within the cns indeed neurons were always the target cell of both viruses during the acute phase of infection but only mice infected by we observed a mononuclear cell infiltration into the cns which included cd4  and cd8  t cells which was correlated with infectious virus clearance to below detectable levels these results suggest that t cell-mediated adaptive immunity in conjunction with innate immunity represented mostly by astrocytes and macrophagesmicroglia figure 4  both play a role in clearance of the two virus recombinants furthermore this correlates well with the fact that injection of cyclosporin a which is known to downregulate t cells resulted in increased lethality of susceptible mice after hcov-oc43 infection jacomy and talbot 2003  a more pronounced t-cell infiltration and a more important expression of some proinflammatory molecules was observed following rocu s24-241 infection which could presumably alter cns homeostasis and trigger axonal injury wallerian degeneration and neuronal death that in turn could contribute to microglial activation and t-cell infiltration chemokines influence the infiltration of immune cells in tissues the ccl2 mcp-1 ccl5 rantes and cxcl10 ip-10 chemokines are produced mainly by glial cells astrocytes and microglia and infiltrating leukocytes babcock et al 2003  in viral meningitis elevated cerebrospinal fluid csf concentrations of cxcl10 and ccl2 were reported lahrtz et al 1998 and increased ccl2 production may contribute to virus-induced neuropathogenesis nakajima et al 2001 peterson et al 1997  damaged neurons in the spinal cord were shown to express ccl2 zhang and de koninck 2006 and neuronal ccl2 is critical for both resident microglia cell activation and macrophage infiltration in the spinal cord zhang et al 2007  therefore our results are consistent with a potential role of ccl2 in triggering neuronal damage since rocu s24-241 induced a a b infection induces a strong inflammatory response and t-cell infiltration in the cns infected mice were sacrificed at 5 9 and 13 dpi a mononuclear cells extracted 5 dpi from mouse brain were gated on lymphocyte cells then plotted according to cd4  and cd8   the numbers appearing in the upper right and left corners indicate the percentage of cd4  and cd8  t lymphocytes respectively from the lymphocyte-gated population images are representative of at least four mice in two independent experiments per virus the cd4  b and cd8  c t-cell frequencies in the cns following rocatcc or rocu s24-241 infection were quantitated at 5 9 and 13 dpi in brains and spinal cords values represent means  standard deviations 5 dpi n  3 for all groups of mice 9 dpi n  3 for all groups of mice 13 dpi n  3 for all groups of mice statistical significance was estimated by an anova test followed by a turkey-kramer test p  005 p  01 p  001 results are representative of two independent experiments paralysis caused by s-mutated human coronavirus h jacomy et al significantly more pronounced ccl2 expression compared to rocatcc-infected animals other studies have illustrated that chemokines not only play a fundamental role in immune system function by recruiting virus-specific t cells lane et al 2006 but that they can also show direct antiviral activity nakayama et al 2006 and may also contribute to cns physiopathologies bajetto et al 2002 glabinski and ransohoff 1999 mennicken et al 1999  our results reinforce the idea that chemokines such as ccl2 could be involved in neurodegeneration in the cns since its production was increased to a significantly higher level in the spinal cord during infection by the demyelination-inducing rocu s24-241 virus compared to wild-type virus we previouly demonstrated that neuronal loss exceeds the number of neurons infected by hcov-oc43 and that noninfected bystander neurons may possibly die due to an excess of secretion of proinflammatory factors after infection a situation which may lead to apoptotic cell death in noninfected neurons jacomy et al 2006  here we demonstrate that the inflammatory response elicited by the recombinant viruses involved activation of glial cells and recruitment of cd4  and cd8  t cells which resulted in the secretion of several cytokines interestingly our study reveals that several cytokines including tnf-a il-1b and il-6 were increased following infection by both viruses but that the production of il-6 was significantly increased following rocu s24-241 infection compared to roc atcc these proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to induce neurotoxicity and could work in concert to synergically induce neuronal damage jeohn et al 1998  and could be involved in several neurodegenerative disorders block and hong 2005  il-1b plays a central role in neuronal injury allan et al 2005 and it mediates both innate and adaptive immune responses directly or by the induction of other cytokines such as il-6 or tnf-a mills and dunne 2009  moreover tnf-a and il-1b are among the most important stimulators of il-6 production by astrocytes and microglia gruol and nelson 1997  importantly a robust rise in il-6 and tnf-a as what is observed after infection by rocu s24-241  may be detrimental since spontaneous inflammatory cns demyelination was described in transgenic mice overexpressing tnf-a probert et al 1997  as well as in rats intrathecally infused with il-6 kaplin et al 2005  also increased amounts of inflammatory molecules may induce a loss of blood-brain barrier integrity and values represent means  standard deviations 5 dpi n  3 for all groups of mice 9 dpi n  3 for all groups of mice 13 dpi n  2 for rocatcc and n  1 for rocu s24-241  statistical significance was estimated by an anova test followed by a turkey-kramer test p  05 p  01 p  001 results are representative of two independent experiments paralysis caused by s-mutated human coronavirus 288 h jacomy et al accumulation of t cells in the cns this could trigger a demyelinating process activation of the innate immune response and neuronal injury in the cns may be linked in the present study we report also neuronal damage in the spinal cord as monitored by the presence of dephosphorylated neurofilaments during the acute phase of the infection by both recombinant viruses however neuronal vulnerability to damage following virus infection could differ between the two viruses indeed the more neurovirulent virus rocu s24-241  infected the spinal cord more rapidly where it produced up to 10 times more infectious particles than rocatcc did it has recently been shown that axonal transport of viral particles could represent a mechanism mediating the extent of axonal damage and the subsequent induction of demyelination in the spinal cord das sarma et al 2009  this fact may render the axons less efficient in conducting the nerve influx thereby affecting the motility of the hind limbs as observed following infection by the rocu s24-241 virus as the increased spread and replication of the rocu s24-241 virus may render axons unstable and more vulnerable to eventual cell death as seen in other neuropathologies jackson et al 2005  motor dysfunctions and axonal damage revealed by dephosphorylated neurofilaments could be seen early during the disease progression between 9 and 11 dpi whereas plaques of demyelination could only be easily observed at 1 month post infection therefore these results suggest that the motor dysfunction is possibly linked to the flaccid paralysis and to eventual development of limited demyelination figure 9  as seen after theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev infection tsunoda et al 2003 tsunoda et al  2007  however as we were never able to detect any dephosphorylation of neurofilaments in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord mostly sensory neurons in the early stages of disease our results also suggest that the main demyelinating process large plaques shown in figure 9 present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord may be related to a different underlying mechanism neuronal damage induced by a viral infection glial activation and local inflammatory reactions could lead to disturbance of cns homeostasis a process that may lead to a modified pathology inflammatory demyelinating lesions were not detectable until 1 month post infection suggesting that axonal damage and subsequent neuroinflammation could trigger myelin destruction as demonstrated in early stages of experimental allergic encephalitis eae wang et al 2005  activated resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages and t cells can produce chemokines and cytokines toxic to axons andor myelin indeed inflammatory responses infection of neurons and lack of axon-myelin interaction could eventually contribute to oligodendrocyte death and subsequent demyelination the need to understand the outcome of infections in predisposed individuals combined with the complexity of performing clinical studies has led to the use of animal models as important tools for the study of viral pathogenesis our study is the first demonstration that virus persistence-associated mutations in the viral s gene of a human respiratory coronavirus that persist in human brains can modify the outcome of infection from an encephalitis to flaccid paralysis and demyelination while maintaining neuronal tropism further studies investigating neuronal cell death mechanisms will help pinpoint which specific factors are involved in the modification of neuropathogenesis after infection by mutated virus wild-type hcov-ocv43 vr-759 obtained in the 1980s from american type culture collection atcc and recombinant virus rocatcc recovered from an infectious cdna clone displayed similar levels of virulence following injection into mouse brains st-jean et al 2006a  recombinant infectious wild-type viral particles rocatcc were obtained after pbac-oc43 fl transfection of bhk-21 cells and amplification by a single passage on the hrt-18 cell line used for routine virus propagation st-jean et al 2006a  the u-87mg astrocytic cells were

specific primers and the highly accurate accuprime pfx enzyme invitrogen the two overlapping pcr fragments covering the complete s gene of the recombinant virus rocu s24-241 were then sequenced to insure that the four introduced mutations in the s gene were conserved and that no other mutations had appeared as c57bl6 mice are more susceptible than balbc to hcov-oc43 infection jacomy and talbot

sars-cov infectious cdna constructs r baric s  sims a c   1 introduction molecular analysis of the structure and function of rna virus genomes has been profoundly advanced by the availability of

assess the function of individual mutations in the 3 0 -most10 kb of the mhv genome methods to assemble an mhv full-length infectious construct have been hampered by the large size of the genome the regions of chromosomal instability and the inability to synthesize full-length transcripts almazn et al 2000 masters 1999 yount et al 2000  this is especially problematic within the group 2 coronavirus replicase where several regions of chromosomal toxicity and instability have hampered the development of infectious cdnas full-length infectious constructs will allow for the systematic dissection of the structure and function of each viral gene the phenotypic consequences of gene rearrangement on virus replication and pathogenesis the development of coronavirus heterologous gene expression systems and a clearer understanding of the transcription and replication strategy of the coronaviridae in this report we review strategies for building coronavirus infectious cdnas by using mouse hepatitis virus strain a59 as a model the coronavirus genome a single-stranded rna is the largest viral rna genome known to exist in nature 276-313 kb genomic rnas have a 5 0 terminal cap and a 3 0 terminal poly a tail in addition a leader sequence of 65-98 nucleotides and a 200-to 400-base pair untranslated region are located at the 5 0 terminus whereas a 200-to 500-base pair untranslated region is located at the 3 0 terminus the 5 0 most two-thirds of the genome encodes the replicase gene in two open reading frames orfs 1a and 1b the latter of which is expressed by ribosomal frameshifting almazn et al 2000 eleouet et al 1995  like many other positive-sense rna viruses the coronavirus replicase is translated as a large precursor polyprotein that is processed by viral proteinases giving rise to15 replicase proteins the functions of most of the coronavirus replicase proteins are unknown however based on nucleotide sequence homology and empirical studies identifiable functions include two papainlike cysteine proteases a chymotrypsin-like 3c protease a cysteinerich growth factor-related protein an rna-dependent rna polymerase a nucleoside triphosphate ntp-bindinghelicase domain and a zincfinger nucleic acid-binding domain enjuanes et al 2000a penzes et al 2001 siddell 1995  most of the replicase gene products colocalize with replication complexes at sites of rna synthesis on internal membranes however a spectrum of genetically informative mutations have not been systematically targeted to any of these replicase proteins so we have little insight into the organization of the replicase complex and the location of functional motifs which regulate transcription replication and rna recombination because of the extremely rich milieu of molecular reagents that are available against the replicase proteins the availability of a molecular clone of mhv allows for the first time a systematic genetic analysis of gene 1 function in coronavirus replication coronavirologists have seized on several different strategies to build infectious cdna clones however all were primarily designed to circumvent problems associated with the large size of the coronavirus genome regions of chromosomal instability and other problems associated with the production of full-length infectious transcripts almazn et al 2000 masters 1999 yount et al 2000  our solution was to assemble infectious cdnas from a panel of contiguous subclones that spanned the entire length of the tgev and mhv genomes each subclone was flanked by unique restriction sites with characteristics that allow for the systematic and precise assembly of a full-length cdna with in vitro ligation for this strategy to be efficient restricted subclone fragments had to be incapable of self-concatemer formation and not spuriously assemble with other noncontiguous subclones conventional class ii restriction enzymes such as ecori leave identical sticky ends that assemble with similarly cut dna in the presence of dna ligase pingoud and jeltsch 2001 sambrook et al 1989  because these enzymes leave identical compatible ends digested fragments randomly self-assemble into large concatamers and therefore they are poor choices for assembling large intact genomes or chromosomes however a second group of class ii restriction enzymes ie bgli bstxi sfii also recognize a symmetrical sequence but leave random sticky ends 1-4 nucleotides in length and consequently restrict assembly cascades along specific pathways table 1  for example the type ii restriction enzyme bgli recognizes the symmetrical sequence gccnnnn  nggc and cleaves a random dna sequence on average every4096 base pairs because 64 different 3-nucleotide overhangs can be generated dna frag- b assuming a totally random dna sequence asymmetric cutters like sapi aari and esp3i can have recognition sites in either strand of dna so actual site frequency is12 of indicated values and can be engineered as no-see-um ments will only assemble with the appropriate 3-nucleotide complementary overhang generated at an identical bgli restriction site as a result identical ends are generated every264000 base pairs providing a powerful means for the construction of very large dna and rna genomes consonant with these findings the type iis restriction enzyme esp3i recognizes an asymmetric sequence and makes a staggered cut 1 and 5 nucleotides downstream of the recognition sequence leaving 256 mostly asymmetrical 4-nucleotide overhangs gctctcn  nnnn as identical esp3i sites are generated every1000000 base pairs or so in a random dna sequence most restricted fragments usually do not self-assemble  rather specific recursive assembly pathways can be designed that hypothetically allow assembly of 1 million base pair dna genomes 2 256 fragments  table 1  we took advantage of several unique properties inherent in type ii restriction enzymes to build coronavirus infectious cdnas initially we isolated five cdna subclones spanning the entire tgev genome designated tgeva b c de and f by rt-pcr using primers that introduced unique bgli restriction sites at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of each fragment without altering the amino acid coding sequences of the virus  table 2  the tgev a c de and f clones were stable in plasmid dnas in escherichia coli the b fragment however was unstable containing deletions or insertions in the wild-type sequence at a region of instability in the tgev genome noted by other investigators almazn et al 2000 eleouet et al 1995  to prevent fragment instability we used primer-mediated mutagenesis to bisect the b fragment at the unstable site with an adjoining bstxi ccattcac  ttgg site resulting in tgev b1 and tgev b2 amplicons  fig 1  table 2  it is likely that sequences  bgli nt 23487 de1-f 3 0 -cggc  acgtccg-5 0 9600-9950 in and around the tgev 3c like protease 3cl pro  motif are either bactericidal or unstable in microbial vectors almazn et al 2000 yount et al 2000  the resulting 6 fragments tgev a b1 b2 c de and f were ligated in vitro to generate a full-length cdna of the tgev genome fig 1  molecularly cloned viruses were indistinguishable from wild type and contained the marker mutations and unique bgli and bstxi junction sequences used in the assembly of the infectious construct yount et al 2000  assembling mhv infectious cdnas one potential problem with the original approach was that several silent mutations were inserted to introduce the unique bgli sites into the tgev component clones to circumvent this problem a variation of the systematic assembly approach was used to build the group ii coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv infectious cdna  the enzyme esp3i recognizes an asymmetrical site and cleaves external to the recognition sequence allowing for traditional and no-see-um cloning applications fig 2  table 1  with traditional approaches esp3i sites can be oriented to reform the recognition site after ligation of two mhv cdnas leaving the restriction site within the genomes of recombinant viruses however the esp3i recognition site is asymmetrical so a simple reverse orientation allows for the insertion of an esp3i recognition sequence on the ends of two adjacent clones with the cleavage site derived from virtually any 4-nucleotide sequence combination dictated by the virus sequence on cleavage and ligation with the adjoining fragment the esp3i sites are lost from the final ligation products leaving a fig 1  strategy for the systematic assembly of tgev full-length cdna the tgev genome is a positive-sense single-stranded rna of about 285 kb six independent subclones a b1 b2 c de and f that span the entire length of the genome were isolated by rt-pcr using primer pairs that introduced unique noti bgli andor bstxi restriction sites at each end on ligation the intact viral genome is generated as a cdna a unique t7 start site and a 25 polyt tail allow for in vitro transcription of full-length capped polyadenylated transcripts yount et al 2000  pl papainlike protease 3cl pro  3cl protease gfl growth factor like pol polymerase motif mib metal binding motif hel helicase motif vdcd variable or conserved domains seamless junction compiled from the exact mhv-a59 sequence because of this property unique junctions can be inserted at virtually any position between two component clones without mutating the viral genome sequence additionally a large number of other restriction enzymes share this property eg sapi aari expanding the utility of the nosee-um technology table 1  during the isolation of the mhv component clones it was also necessary to remove three preexisting esp3i sites located throughout the mhv orf1 sequence bonilla et al 1994  mutations inserted to ablate these sites were used as marker mutations to distinguish molecularly fig 2  use of esp3i in the traditional and no-see-um approaches the traditional approach to the use of esp3i involves the ligation of two fragments containing identical esp3i restriction sites resulting in a ligation product with an intact esp3i site remaining in the no-see-um approach a simple reverse orientation of the restriction sites allows for the specific removal of the esp3i site from the two fragments resulting in a ligation product lacking the engineered restriction site the use of the no-see-um technology allows for the assembly of large dnas from smaller subclones without the incorporation of unique restriction sites into the genome cloned and wild-type virus we then isolated seven consensus cdnas that spanned the entire length of the mhv-a59 genome in the same manner as the tgev infectious construct fig 3  this was necessary because the mhv-a59 genome contains several major regions of sequence toxicity in microbial cloning vectors most of which map be-tween10 and 15 kb in the mhv orf 1aorf 1b polyprotein and an unstable region mapping50 kb in orf 1a as described for the tgev b fragment cdnas were isolated after intersecting the toxic domains and separating them into independent subclones however many subclones were still unstable in traditional puc-based cloning vectors eg pgem topoii even when maintained at low temperature consequently we used psmart cloning vectors lucigen which lack a promoter and indicator gene and contain transcriptional and translational terminators surrounding the cloning site instability appears to be associated with expression as this entire domain nucleotides 9555-15754 is also stable in yeast vectors pyes21 topo ta cloning kit from invitrogen that maintain tight regulation over foreign gene expression yount et al unpublished results  full-length mhv-a59 cdna was systematically assembled through the simultaneous in vitro ligation of a series of seven subgenomic cdnas  in the future it may be possible to construct larger subgenomic fragments spanning the entire genome by using the psmart cloning vectors thereby simplifying the assembly strategy although we have not tested this directly the tgev and mhv a fragments contain a t7 promoter whereas the tgev f and mhv g fragments terminate in a polyt tract at the 3 0 end allowing for in vitro t7 transcription of infectious capped polyadenylated transcripts the polya tails generated from these transcripts are 25 nucleotides in length which appears sufficient for transcript infectivity at this time we do not know the minimal number of 3 0 polya residues necessary for transcript infectivity or whether a 5 0 methylated cap is essential electroporation of the genomic-length rnas resulted in the production of recombinant mhv virus with growth characteristics identical to those of the wild-type viruses yount et al 2000  importantly the molecularly cloned viruses contained marker mutations engineered into the component clones inclusion of nuclocapsidn-encoding transcripts enhanced the infectivity of full-length mhv and tgev transcripts in mhv n transcripts enhanced the infectivity of full-length mhv-a59 transcripts by 10-to 15-fold as evidenced by increased viral antigen expression and virus titers at 25 h postinfection  it is unclear whether mhv n transcripts n protein or both are essential for increased virus yields after electroporation or whether this effect would be observed with transcripts encoding unrelated genes coronaviruses have been demonstrated to package low concentrations of subgenomic mrnas especially n transcripts and several studies have suggested that n may function in transcription and replication and are tightly associated with the replication complex with ibv but not tgev or hcov-229e n transcripts are absolutely essential for full-length transcript infectivity casais et al 2001  with hcov-229e other groups have shown that the n gene is not required for subgenomic transcription  clearly additional studies are needed to evaluate the role of n protein in rna transcript infectivity the mhv cdna cassettes can be ligated systematically as described for tgev or simultaneously although numerous incomplete assembly intermediates were evident our demonstration that simultaneous ligation of seven cdnas will result in full-length cdna will simplify the complexity of the assembly strategy at this time there is no evidence to indicate that this approach might introduce spurious mutations or genome rearrangements from aberrant assembly cascades however it is possible that such variants might arise after rna transfection as a consequence of high-frequency mhv rna recombination between incomplete and genome-length transcripts it is likely that such variants would be replication impaired and rapidly out-competed by wild-type virus a second limitation is that the yield of full-length cdna product is reduced resulting in less robust transfection efficiencies compared with the more traditional systematic assembly method at this time the mhv approach suffers from the large number of component clones seven which increase the complexity of the system and reduce the yield of full-length cdna product after in vitro ligation if the large number of toxic domains in the mhv genome is duplicated in other group ii coronaviruses this will likely interfere with the development of other infec- fig 3  systematic assembly strategy for the construction of mhv-a59 full-length cdna the mhv genome is a positive-sense single-stranded rna of315 kb seven independent subclones a b c d e f and g that span the entire mhv genome were isolated by rt-pcr unique bgli and esp3i restriction sites located at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of each subclone were used to assemble a full-length cdna a unique t7 start site was inserted at the 5 0 end of the mhv a fragment and a 25 polyt tail was inserted at the 3 0 end of the mhv f fragment allowing for in vitro transcription of full-length capped poly-adenylated transcripts note esp3i sites are lost in the assembly process t tious cdnas as well topics of future research include 1 can group ii coronavirus cdnas be stabilized as full-length constructs in bacterial artificial chromosomes or poxvirus vectors as has been reported with tgev ibv and hcov 229e 2 how does n function to enhance infectivity of full-length transcripts 3 how can we enhance yields or the infectivity of coronavirus infectious cdnas and transcripts and allow for critical review of the consequences of lethal mutations 4 can we reduce the number of component clones needed to assemble group ii coronavirus infectious cdnas our assembly strategy for coronavirus infectious constructs is simple and straightforward although the synthesis of full-length transcripts is technically challenging in contrast to infectious clones of other positive-strand viruses our tgev and mhv constructs must be assembled de novo and do not exist intact in bacterial or viral vectors this does not restrict the methods applicability for reverse genetic applications rather it allows for rapid genetic manipulation of independent subclones which minimizes the introduction of spurious mutations elsewhere in the genome during recombinant dna manipulation theoretical limits of our method may exceed several million base pairs of dna and will likely surmount the cloning capacity of bacterial bac and eukaryotic artificial chromosome vectors grimes and cooke 1998  our systematic assembly method should also be appropriate for constructing full-length infectious clones of other large rna viruses including coronaviruses 27-32 kb toroviruses 24-27 kb and filoviruses like marburg 19 kb de vries et al 1997 peters et al 1996  viral genomes that are unstable in prokaryotic vectors can also be cloned by these methods boyer and haenni 1994 rice et al 1989  moreover the technique should allow the systematic assembly of full-length infectious dsdna genomes of adenoviruses herpesviruses and perhaps other large dna viruses that promise to be powerful tools in vaccination gene transfer and gene therapy smith and enquist 2000 van zijl et al 1988  recently genome sequences from a large number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have been obtained providing significant insight into gene organization structure and function cho et al 1999 hutchison et al 1999  tigr homepage httpwwwtigrorg using this strategy it may be possible to reconstruct a minimal microbial genome from the bottom up however problems associated with isolating large dna fragments and the introduction of large dna genomes into environments that permit replication will likely be significant hurdles nevertheless our assembly strategy may provide a means to analyze the function of large blocks of dna such as pathogenesis islands or to engineer chromosomes that contain large gene cassettes of interest cho et al 1999  coronaviruses provide a unique system for the incorporation and expression of one or more foreign genes enjuanes and van der zeijst 1995  coronavirus genes rarely overlap simplifying the design and expression of foreign genes from downstream intergenic sequences is start sites integration of the coronavirus rna genome into the host cell chromosome is unlikely  additionally recombinant viruses or replicon particles could be readily targeted to other mucosal surfaces in swine or to other species by simple replacements in the s glycoprotein gene which has been shown to determine tissue-and species tropism ballesteros et al 1997 delmas et al 1992 kuo et al 2000 leparc-goffart et al 1998 snchez et al 1999 tresnan et al 1996  furthermore coronaviruses infect a number of different species including human porcine bovine canine and feline and are available for the development of expression systems snchez et al 1992  additionally the coronavirus helical ribonucleocapsid structure may further relax the packaging constraints of the virus as compared to icosahedral structures enjuanes and van der zeijst 1995 lai and cavanagh 1997 risco et al 1996  selected questions that remain unanswered include 1 what is the coding capacity of coronavirus based expression systems 2 what is the minimal genome required for efficient replication 3 can high-titer coronavirus replicon particles be obtained for vaccine applications 4 what are the minimal sequence requirements for subgenomic transcription 5 how many foreign genes can be coordinately regulated without impeding virus replication or immunogenicity 6 what are the efficacy stability and safety of the recombinant coronaviruses in natural settings clearly these vaccine-related topics will provide fruitful avenues of investigation over the next decade and will greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanics of coronavirus transcription replication assembly and release and pathogenesis the

flanking sequences around the target domain are amplified as separate arms linked by unique class iis restriction site oriented as described in fig 3  a third amplicon encoding the payload sequence of interest is isolated and flanked by similar class iis sites after restriction digestion and ligation the foreign sequences are inserted into the backbone sequence at any given nucleotide leaving no evidence of the restriction sites that were used to sew the new sequences into the mhv backbone we have successfully expressed gfp from the orf 3a locus of tgev curtis et al 2002 and orf 4 of mhv fig 5  manuscript in preparation demonstrating the feasibility of the method and the use of tgev and mhv as expression vectors in the case with tgev gfp expression was stable for at least 10 passages in

b-glucuronidase gus and prrsv orf 5 from a tgev-derived minigenome was demonstrated alonso et al 2002  importantly strong humoral immune responses against gus and prrsv orf5 were generated in swine with these vectors demonstrating the feasibility of coronavirus-based vectors for future vaccine development amplified with a second primer site b containing a esp3i recognition at the 5 0 end of the nonsense strand of dna by pcr a similar approach is used to amplify the downstream arm site c and d primers the insert dna is amplified with primer pairs containing compatible c and d esp3i sites after pcr amplification and restriction digestion the new insert can be inserted into the viral genome without evidence of the restriction sites used in the assembly cascade a large number of class

molecularly cloned viruses are rescued allowing for genetic manipulation of the genome identification of the first human coronavirus to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide provided the first template to test the rapidity of our systematic assembly strategy drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003  development of novel vaccine candidates and therapeutics requires a better understanding of viral pathogenesis a process greatly facilitated by the availability of an infectious clone a systematic assembly strategy based on the tgev infectious clone was employed to create an infectious construct of the sars-cov within2 months of the identification and isolation of genomic sars-cov rna yount et al 2003  consensus clones were assembled from sibling clones of each sars-cov fragment by taking advantage of the special properties of asymmetric type iis restriction enzymes within 9 weeks infectious clone sars-cov was isolated that was phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type sars-cov strains the sars-cov genome was cloned as six contiguous subclones that could be systematically linked by unique bgli restriction endonuclease sites fig 6  two bgli junctions were derived from sites encoded within the sars-cov genome at nt 4373 ab junction and nt 12065 cd junction a third bgli site at nt 1577 was removed and new bgli sites were inserted by the introduction of silent mutations into the sars-cov sequence at nt 8700 bc junction nt 18916 de junction and nt 24040 ef junction the resulting cdnas include sars a nt 1-4436 sars b nt 4 712 sars c nt 8 070 sars d nt

transcripts sars-cov infectious clone virus was assembled transcribed and transfected as described previously and recombinant viruses contained the marker mutations inserted into the infectious clone recombinant viruses produced a mild pneumonia on x-ray in macaques similar to wild-type viruses and replicated to similar titers in the mouse model unpublished observation these data suggest that recombinant viruses recapitulated the pathogenesis of wild type in animal models allowing for the identification of pathogenesis determinants and developing attenuated viruses as candidate live and killed vaccines the availability of infectious cdna clones will undoubtedly have a profound effect on the field of coronavirology these new tools will facilitate basic studies and allow for more

assemble a full-length cdna a unique t7 start site was inserted at the 5 0 end of the sars-cov a fragment and a 21 polyt tail was inserted at the 3 0 end of the sars-cov g fragment allowing for in vitro transcription of full-length capped polyadenylated transcripts nomic rna packaging in addition studies of gene function will be enhanced by the availability of infectious cdna clones by allowing for the construction of recombinant viruses andor replicons containing mutations and the analysis of their effects on viral replication and assembly mhv has long been used as a premiere model to study coronavirus assembly and release replication transcription entry and pathogenesis the availability of mhv and sars-cov infectious cdna clones will complement the existing targeted recombination approaches by providing a tool for the mutagenesis of the replicase gene which encode a large number of cleavage products that have not been fully characterized the structure and function of the20-kb mhv replicase domain will likely remain a fertile area of research for the next decade and reveal novel protein functions that participate and regulate discontinuous transcription and high-frequency rna recombination although large panels of reagents are available for analyzing replicase protein expression processing and subcellular localization a spectrum of genetically informative mutations have not been systematically targeted to any of these replicase proteins given the complexity and size of the coronavirus replicase gene the number of potential mutants that can be generated is enormous and will likely require bioinformatic approaches for building and testing specific hypotheses for example the orf1a c-terminal mhv p15 protein is highly conserved among group i through iii coronaviruses and contains a large number of conserved cysteine residues and predicted phosphorylation myristylation and glycosylation sites prosite unpublished fig 7  the original sequence report of p15 also suggested possible similarities to growth factor-like proteins lee et al 1991  recent studies with an ibv homolog suggest that p15 exists as a dimer and accumulates on stimulation with epidermal growth factor providing some evidence that the protein might be involved in the growth factor signaling pathway ng and liu 2002  a single amino acid mutation has been identified in p15 of the temperature sensitive mutant la6 an mhv-a59 mutant with a defect in rna synthesis at nonpermissive temperature  the availability of infectious cd-nas allows for the first time a systematic mutagenesis approach for studying the function of specific structural features within this and other replicase proteins coupled with the capacity to isolate large panels of mutants in each of the replicase proteins selected questions include 1 are each of the pl1 pro  pl2 pro  and 3cl pro cleavage sites necessary for mhv replication 2 are the pl1 pro  pl2 pro  or 3cl pro proteases essential for replication 3 are any replicase proteins nonessential 4 is replicase gene order critical 5 are replicase proteins interchangeable between the group 1 andor group 2 coronaviruses 6 how do replication complexes form on membranes 7 what replicase complexes regulate discontinuous transcription and synthesis of genome-length and subgenomic-length mrnas and negative-strand rnas 8 what are the cis-acting sequence elements required for genomic rna packaging and replication 9 what are the structure-function relationships within and between various replicase proteins andor rnas 10 what are the functions of the group-specific orfs and how do they influence pathogenesis the next decade of research may well be defined as the golden age of coronavirus genetics fig 7  potential sites of mutagenesis within the c-terminal orf1a p15 replicase protein the mhv p15 replicase protein is highly conserved among all coronaviridae hatched domains contains several hydrophobic domains hp1-5 and several potential sites for myristylation gray triangles and 10 highly conserved cysteine residues cys several sites for phosphorylation and glycosylation are predicted with prosite analysis although it is unclear whether p15 is phosphorylated or glycosylated  identification of novel functional regions within the spike glycoprotein of mhv-a59 based on a bioinformatics approach gili kaufman pinghua liu julian leibowitz l   mouse hepatitis virus mhv is a member of the family coronaviridae it includes large single and positive stranded rna viruses that induce a spectrum of acute and chronic diseases of the neurological gastrointestinal and respiratory system in animals and humans such as the human pathogens sars-cov and hcov-oc43 weiss and leibowitz 2011 mhv has been widely utilized as a model for viral pathogenesis particularly the two most commonly studied strains of mhv mhv-a59 and mhv-jhm infection of c57bl6 mice with mhv-a59 causes mild encephalitis sub-acute demyelination and acute hepatitis weiss and leibowitz 2007 weiss and leibowitz 2011 the largely immunologically mediated demyelinating disease in mice serves as an extensively investigated model for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis ms weiss and leibowitz 2007 das sarma et al 2000 the major structural proteins of mhv virion include the spike glycoprotein s the envelope protein e the membrane protein m and the nucleocapsid protein n although the multifunctional protein n contributes to the pathogenic outcome of coronavirus infection cowley et al 2010 the mhv s protein plays a major role in the pathogenesis since it recognizes and binds the cellular receptor for the virus ceacam1a mediates cell entry by inducing fusion of viral and cell membranes subsequently facilitates virus spread to other cells by inducing cell to cell fusion syncytium formation at late times in infection when the s protein is abundantly present on the plasma membrane of infected cells dveksler et al 1991 and recently it was found to regulate the intracellular transport of the viral genome from the cell surface to the er zhu et al 2009 s is also a major target of the host immune response eliciting neutralizing antibodies and cd8 cytotoxic t cell responses castro and perlman 1995 the mhv s glycoprotein is 1324 amino acids long the primary 146 kda translation product is acylated n-glycosylated and trimmed subsequently to yield the mature 180 kda protein the mature s protein is post-translationally cleaved in most mhv strains by host proteases into two 90 kda subunits an amino terminal subunit s1 and a carboxy terminal subunit s2 frana et al 1985 s1s2 cleavage does not destroy virus infectivity rather it increases the potency of coronaviruses to mediate cellcell fusion and promotes rapid virus dissemination frana et al 1985 de haan et al 2004 s1 makes up the unique globular-head structure of the spike and contains the receptor binding activity the s2 subunit contains two heptad repeats regions that are part of the stalk structure of the spike and are required for membrane fusion a trans-membrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain in the cell that is in the interior of the virus particle after budding is completed reviewed in heald-sargent and gallagher 2012 in addition s protein was found to interact with the fc region of immunoglobulin g igg oleszak et al 1990 the mhv s protein behaved as a molecular mimic of the host murine fc receptor mfcriiriii in that it bound igg in an fc dependent manner was immunoprecipitated by the 24g2 anti-fcriiriii monoclonal antibody and the fc binding activity of s protein was expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells oleszak et al 1990 oleszak et al 1992 this fc binding activity is also exhibited by the related type 2a betacoronavirus bovine coronavirus bcov s protein oleszak et al 1995 however the human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 a virus closely related to bcov did not exhibit molecular mimicry of fcriiriii in that it was not reactive with the 24g2 monoclonal antibody oleszak et al 1995 analysis of the fc binding activity of mhv s proteins containing either naturally occurring deletions in the s protein neutralizing monoclonal antibody escape mutants containing s protein deletions or recombinant s proteins suggested that this activity most likely resided in the s1 domain parker et al 1989 taguchi and fleming 1989 and excluded determinants of fc binding activity being present in the mhv s1 hyper-variable region oleszak et al 1992 to investigate this further we hypothesize that regions containing specific amino acid sequences within the spike glycoprotein of mhv-a59 and other related strains that exhibited fcr binding activity would exhibit sequence similarity with the murine fc rii and fcriii mfcrii and mfcriii respectively receptors tamm et al 1996 but not with the corresponding amino acids of the hcov-oc43 s protein that did not exhibit fc binding activity oleszak et al 1995 suggesting to us several regions of interest within the spike glycoprotein as targets for mutagenesis to test this hypothesis in this study targeted amino acid residues of s protein were replaced with alanine or with the homologous amino acids residues from the s protein of hcov-oc43 the mutant spike glycoproteins were expressed in murine dbt cells by the vector pcaggs-s niwa et al 1991 metabolically labeled with 35s and immunoprecipitated by the neutralizing anti-s monoclonal antibodies a21 and a23 to test that they had folded correctly gilmore et al 1987 subsequently spike genes encoding proteins with the substituted amino acids were introduced into recombinant isolates of mhv-a59 by targeted recombination kuo et al 2000 phillips et al 2001 several mutant viruses with interesting phenotypes were recovered a recombinant virus containing a p939l mutation in the spike protein had a decreased ability to induce cellcell fusion a cysteine in position 547 and the amino acids in positions 581586 within the s1 fragment of spike glycoprotein were essential for virus viability a c547a mutation greatly decreased the reactivity with the a21 and a23 monoclonal antibodies suggesting that this cysteine was required for proper folding three mutants in which mhv residues were replaced by the corresponding amino acids in the hcov-oc43 s protein resulted in viruses that grew less well than the wild type virus however none of these regions was found to affect the binding of s to the anti fcr antibody 24g2 implying that the molecular mimicry property is determined not only by sequence similarity to the binding domains of fc receptor but most probably also the unique secondary and tertiary structure of the protein as well dbt and human epithelial kidney cells 293t were maintained at 37 c and 5 co2 in dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem supplemented with 10 calf serum hyclone fcwf felis catus whole fetus cells were grown in dmem supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum l2 cells were maintained at 37 c and 3 co2 in dmem supplemented with 10 calf serum the origin and growth of mhv-a59 have been described previously leibowitz et al 2011 leibowitz et al 1981 the recombinant a59 fa59 viruses containing the feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv spike protein ectodomain in place of the mhv-a59 ectodomain kuo et al 2000 was generously provided by prof susan r weiss university of pennsylvania and propagated in fcwf cells mhv strain a59 s gene was expressed in the pcaggs-s plasmid vector kindly provided by prof thomas m gallagher boscarino et al 2008 all mutations in the s protein were created by using mutagenic primers and overlap-extension pcr cormack 2001 followed by ta cloning of mutagenized amplicons into pgem-t easy promega and subsequent sequencing cloned amplicons containing the introduced mutation were excised with unique restriction enzymes and replaced the corresponding restriction fragments in s in the pcaggs-s vector to produce the corresponding plasmids pcaggs-s 546548 pcaggs-s 546548 pcaggs-s 554556 pcaggs-s 581586 pcaggs-s 562589 pcaggs-s 667687 pcaggs-s 910939 and pcaggs-s 939 all plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations table 1
 for targeted recombination a fragment of about 3 kb including the mutation was excised from the corresponding pcaggs-s expressing vector with swai and mlui and transferred to the targeted recombination plasmid pmh54 kuo et al 2000 to produce the corresponding plasmids pmh54 546548 pmh54 546548 pmh54 554556 pmh54 581586 pmh54 562589 pmh54 667687 pmh54 910939 and pmh54 939 respectively 293t cells were transfected by mixing 4 g plasmid dnas with 16 l of lipofectamine 2000 invitrogen in 1 ml opti-mem gibco and applied to 106 cells for 4 h and then removed and replaced with complete media at 24 h post-tranfection medium was removed from each culture and the cell lysate was prepared as described previously oleszak et al 1990 and stored at 80 c monolayers of dbt cells in 6-well plates were infected with the appropriate viruses at an moi of 3 plaque forming units per cell at 37 c for 1hr transfected 293t cells and infected dbt cells were radiolabeled with 400 ciml 35s-methionine and cysteine for 67 h post transfection or 8 h post infection until 95100 of the monolayer was involved in syncytia respectively cytoplasmic extracts of infected and control cells were prepared in 250 l of lysing buffer 10 mm trishcl ph 74 10 mm nacl 15 mm mgcl2 05 np40 02 tiuml aprotinin on ice as described previously oleszak et al 1990 and stored at 80 c twenty microliter of

primary antibodies a21 and a23 or 24g2 respectively for an additional hour unbound antibodies were washed away with pbs and the protein g beadsantibody complexes were resuspended in mrip buffer 10 mm

collected by centrifugation and washed five times with mrip buffer the bound antigens were eluted by heating at 70 c for 5 min in sds-page sample buffer the samples were resolved by sds-page at 10 ma for about 10 h as described by laemmli and favre laemmli and favre 1973 followed by phosphoimager ge healthcare autoradiography plasmids pmh54 pmh54s 546548 pmh54s 546548 pmh54s 581586 pmh54s 562589 pmh54s 667687 pmh54s 910939 and pmh54s 939 were digested and linearized with paci and donor rnas were transcribed with t7 rna polymerase as previously described kuo et al 2000 leibowitz et al 2011 targeted recombination with mhv-a59 was performed as described previously kuo et al 2000 leibowitz et al 2011 with a few modifications briefly fmhv corresponding to mhv-a59 in which the sequences encoding the spike protein ectodomain had been replaced by the corresponding feline infectious virus fipv spike ectodomain coding sequence was used as an acceptor virus fcwf cells were infected with fmhv and incubated for 6 h cells were nucleofected with the transcribed donor rnas using program t-020 and the nucleofector v kit lonza and the nucleofected cells were overlaid onto a monolayer of dbt cells the cultures were incubated up to 72 h or until cytopathic effect destroyed the monolayer recombinant viruses able to enter and replicate in murine cells and those which contained the desired mhv-a59 spike ectodomain were selected by plaque assay on l2 cells well-separated plaques containing putative recombinant viruses were picked and underwent a second cycle of plaque purification the twice plaque cloned viruses were expanded in murine l2 cells and their recombinant nature was confirmed by rt-pcr and sequencing viral titers were determined by plaque assay on monolayers of l2 cells as previously described leibowitz et al 1982 dbt cells were grown in 6-well cluster plates to a density of approximately 106 cells per well infected with wild type or mutant viruses 3 pfucell and the cells were incubated at 37 c after 55 7 and 9 h the nuclei were stained with dapi and photographed using a fluorescence microscope the number of nuclei contained in syncytial cells was counted for 10 randomly selected fields for each viral strain an alignment of the mhv-a59 and mhv-jhm s protein amino acids sequences to the mfcrii igg binding domain revealed several short regions with modest sequence similarity fig 1a the most robust of which corresponded to residues 546548 in mhv-a59 oleszak et al 1990 we selected this region of the mhv-a59 s protein for our initial studies and created a plasmid designated pcaggs-s 546548 for expressing a mutant s protein in which residues r546c547q548 were changed to alanine to determine the effect that this mutation had on the overall conformation of the protein we compared its expression and its immunoreactivity with two different conformationally sensitive anti-s monoclonal antibodies known to neutralize mhv-a59 infectivity and block infection with virus like particles containing the mhv-a59 structural proteins gilmore et al 1987 bos et al 1997 compared to that of wild type s protein expressed in the same vector replicate cultures of 293 t cells were transfected with pcaggs-s or pcaggs-s 546548 and after 24 h post transfection the cells were metabolically labeled with 35s cysteine and methionine for 9 h harvested cytoplasmic extracts prepared and then immunoprecipitated with the anti-spike monoclonal neutralizing antibodies a21 and a23 gilmore et al 1987 or with a polyclonal rabbit anti-spike antibody b46 kindly provided by dr john fleming and dr k holmes respectively as shown in fig 2a the s 546548 mutant protein was barely recognized by both antibodies signal corresponding to the complete 180 kda protein was barely discernible compared to the robust signals obtained from the wild type glycoprotein either similarly expressed by transfection or from cell lysates prepared from mhv-a59 infected dbt cells moreover the cleaved 90 kda s1 and s2 subunits could not be detected in contrast the b46 polyclonal antibody strongly immunoprecipitated s 546548 making it unlikely that the weak reactivity with the a21 and a23 antibodies was due to decreased stability of the mutant protein relative to wild type s protein fig 2a together these results suggest that alanine substitution mutations at positions 546548 produced a major change in the conformation of the s protein we then considered the possibility that this major change in conformation may have largely been due to our mutation of c457 a residue that could play a role in maintaining the overall conformation of the protein through a disulfide bridge therefore we made a second construct containing the r546a and q548a mutations into pcaggs-s pcaggs-s 546548 and transfected it into cells in parallel with the parental pcaggs-s after radiolabeling for 9 h starting at 24 h post transfection lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with a21 a23 or with a polyclonal b46 antibody as shown in fig 2b both the 90 kda cleaved s1s2 subunits and the uncleaved full length 180 kda forms of the s protein were immunoprecipatated by the two monoclonal antibodies as well as the uncleaved protein by the polyclonal b46 antibody data not shown suggesting that the r546aq548a mutations did not alter the overall conformation of the s protein and allowed it to fold properly the r546aq548a mutations were introduced into the plasmid pmh54 and subsequently into a recombinant mhv-a59 ra59s 546548 by targeted recombination a viable recombinant virus expressing these mutations was recovered without difficulty and achieved titers somewhat lower 1 log but not statistically different than those achieved by the isogenic control virus ra59 pmh54 and had a plaque size that was statistically indistinguishable from that of wild type plaques fig 2c immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from dbt cells infected with ra59s 546548 and labeled for 1 h from 7 to 8 hpi with the a23 monoclonal antibody confirmed this mutation did not interfere with the overall conformation of the protein fig 2b similarly the s protein carrying the r546aq548a mutations was immunoprecipitated by the anti-fcriiriii monoclonal antibody 24g2 fig 3a making it unlikely that the amino acids in positions 546 and 548 were part of the epitope responsible for the fcrii molecular mimicry by the s protein in contrast multiple attempts to recover a virus containing a c547a mutation in addition to the two alanine replacement mutations in ra59s 546548 were unsuccessful and this included an attempt to recover temperature-sensitive viruses by performing targeted recombination at 34 c or 39 c within the s protein region with the greatest sequence similarity to the fcriiriii proteins 546556 there was a second trio of amino acids l554 l 555 and n556 with perfect sequence identity amongst these proteins a mutant s protein containing alanine replacement mutations at these 3 positions were expressed in pcaggs-s pcaggs-s 554556 immunoprecipitation with the a21 and a23 monoclonal antibodies gave results similar to those obtained with pcaggs-s 546548 namely the mutant protein was precipitated by these conformational dependent antibodies as efficiently as wild type s protein data not shown indicating that the mutant protein was likely able to fold correctly sequences encoding the alanine replacement mutations were introduced into plasmid pmh54 by restriction fragment exchange and we subsequently performed targeted recombination to introduce these mutations into mhv-a59 a recombinant virus designated ra59s 554556 containing the desired s protein mutations was successfully recovered however unlike the previous recombinant this virus formed plaques with a mean diameter of 117  018 mm whereas the plaques formed by the isogenic control virus containing the wild type s sequence had a mean diameter of 236  020 mm p
  001 the ra59s 554556 virus grew to titers that were equal to those achieved by control virus sequencing of the s gene failed to reveal any second site compensatory mutations and this sequence and plaque phenotype was stable over three passages immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from dbt cells infected with ra59s 554556 and labeled for 1 h with 35s methionine and cysteine from 7 to 8 hpi with the a21 and a23 monoclonal antibody confirmed that this mutation did not interfere with the overall conformation of the protein both the non-cleaved and cleaved subunits were recognized by the monoclonal antibodies a21 fig 3b and a23 data not shown similarly immunoprecipitation with the anti-fc receptor antibody 24g2 brought down the 180 kda non-cleaved s protein making it unlikely that these residues by themselves were involved in molecular mimicry of fcrii by s protein fig 3c a third region of sequence similarity between the mhv s protein and the murine fcriiriii proteins is located at positions 581586 vkydly in the s protein approximately 30 amino acids c-terminal to the sequences we examined above fig 1a thus we replaced five of the amino acids all but l585 with alanine in the pcaggs-s expression vector to create the plasmid pcaggs-s 581586 and expressed this mutant in 293 t cells transfected cells were metabolically labeled with 35s-methioninecysteine and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-spike antibodies a21 and a23 although the 180 kda uncleaved spike glycoprotein was clearly precipitated by both antibodies the cleaved 90 kda s1 and s2 subunits were not brought down by either one of the antibodies fig 4
 to determine if the spike glycoprotein containing the alanine substitutions in positions 581586 was fully functional we attempted to recover a recombinant strain containing the s 581586 mutations utilizing targeted recombination three independent attempts to recover a virus expressing the mutation were unsuccessful thus despite the sequence similarity between the three short regions of mhva59 s protein 546548 554556 and 581586 to the regions of fcrii sequences that were part of the structural loops that make up the fc binding site only two regions of s were found to be functionally essential for the recovery of new virions the cysteine residue in position 546 and the region that includes the amino acid sequence in positions 581586 as noted above mutation of the amino acids at positions 554556 did not seem to interfere with the ability of the s protein to be immunoprecipitated by the 24g2 antibody from viable recovered recombinants fig 3 although the spike glycoproteins of several members of the betacoronaviruses are known to possess the property of fc binding the human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 also a group 2a betacoronavirus does not exhibit this property whereas the very closely related bovine coronavirus bcov does bind the fc domain of rabbit igg and is recognized by the anti- fcriiriii monoclonal antibody 24g2 oleszak et al 1995 we hypothesized that a sequence comparison searching for regions that bcov and mhv s proteins had in common but that differed from the hcov-oc43 s protein might identify potential sequences involved in the fc binding activity this bioinformatics analysis fig 1b revealed three distinct regions that included specific pairs of amino acids these amino acid pairs were conserved within the s protein of mhv-a59 and bcov but not in hcov-oc43 two of the regions were located in the s1 domain to test our hypothesis we replaced each one of the paired amino acids in mhv-a59 s protein with the homologous residues in the hcov-oc43 s protein the first paired amino acids substitution was the replacement of the threonine residues in positions 562 and 589 of mhv-a59 spike glycoprotein with their homologues in hcov-oc43 t562l and t589l a second paired amino acid substitution was made by the replacement of serine in position 667 and aspartic acid in position 687 with their homologues in hcov-oc43 s667t and d687y plasmids driving the expression of these mutant spike proteins containing these paired amino acid substitutions pcaggs-s 562589 and pcaggs-s 667687 were transfected into 293 t cells the transfected cells were metabolically labeled for 9 h starting at 24 h after transfection subsequently lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal neutralizing antibodies a21 and a23 fig 5a the non-cleaved and cleaved subunits of the s protein were precipitated by both neutralizing antibodies however the signal corresponding to the cleaved s1 and s2 subunits expressed by pcaggs-s 667687 and immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal antibodies a23 and a21 was weaker than the intensity of the signal for s1 and s2 obtained with lysates from cells transfected with wild type pcaggs-s fig 5a this data is consistent with the s667 t andor d687y mutations within mhv-a59 spike protein changing the conformation and either decreasing the cleavage efficiency of the spike protein into s1 and s2 subunits or alternatively decreasing the affinity of both a21 and a23 antibodies to their binding sites in the uncleaved s protein but not the cleaved subunits the data does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities viable mhv-a59 recombinant viruses expressing each one of the paired substituted amino acids were successfully recovered and mutant s proteins immunoprecipitated from infected cell lysates by both antibodies a21 data not shown and a23 fig 5a the titer achieved by the virus containing the mutant ra59s 562589 was about 10-fold less than that achieved by wild type isogenic control virus and the titer achieved by ra59s 667687 was about 100-fold less than wild type virus fig 5b a comparison of their plaque sizes fig 5b and c was in line with the relative titers achieved by each with the diameter of plaques formed by ra59s 562589 being 70 of those formed by wild type virus and plaques formed by ra59s 667687 being 50 the diameter of wild type plaques immunoprecipitation reactions of lysates prepared from ra59s 562589 supplemental fig s1 ra59s 667687 data not shown and isogenic control infected dbt cells with the anti-fcriiriii antibody 24g2 showed that these mutations did not affect the recognition of s by this antibody a third pair of amino acids that were identical in bcov and mhv s proteins but differed in the hcov-oc43 s protein was identified at positions 910 and 939 of the mhv-a59 spike protein between the s1-s2 cleavage site and the first heptad repeat sequence fig 1 the paired amino acids residues were located in a region highly conserved amongst the 2a lineage of betacoronaviruses and have been hypothesized to be important for the fusion of the coronavirus envelop with the plasma membrane of the host cell chambers et al 1990 de groot et al 1987 the paired amino acids residues asparagine and proline in positions 910 and 939 of the mhv-a59 spike protein were replaced with their homologues from hcov-oc43 n910k and p939l respectively the spike protein with the paired amino acids substitutions was expressed in 293 t cells by the expression vector pcaggs-s 910939 and subsequently the uncleaved s protein and the cleaved subunits were precipitated by the neutralizing antibodies a21 fig 6a left panel and a23 not shown the substituted amino acids did not affect binding of the n910kp929l mutant s protein to either monoclonal antibody nor did it affect s protein cleavage we next replaced the wild type s sequence with the s 910939 s sequence by targeted recombination and were successful in recovering a recombinant virus ra59s 910939 expressing the 180 kda spike protein with the substituted amino acids and mutant s proteins immunoprecipitated from infected cell lysates with monoclonal antibody a23 fig 6a right panel both cleaved and uncleaved s protein were recognized by a23 congruent with the results obtained in the transient transfection experiments fig 6a left panel a one-step growth curve experiment fig 6b revealed that the ra59s 910939 mutant grew with roughly similar kinetics as the wild type isogenic control virus but reached a peak titer that was depressed by approximately 1 log relative to the isogenic control strain the effect of the mutation on plaque size was much greater with the ra59s 910939 mutant virus forming significantly smaller plaques approximately 10 the diameter of those produced by the isogenic control strain fig 6c and d since the amino acid residue in position 939 resided in the hypothesized fusion peptide chambers et al 1990 we made the working assumption that it was likely that the p939l mutation is largely responsible for the phenotype we observed in a59s 910939 thus a cdna containing a single amino acid substitution at position 939 p939l was constructed and introduced into the mhv-a59 s protein by targeted recombination and a viable mutant ra59s 939 was recovered the recombinant ra59s 939 virus grew with slightly slower kinetics than the double mutant virus va59s 910939 but ultimately reached a peak titer similar to that of the double mutant fig 6b based on previously published data implicating this region of the s protein as containing the fusion peptide 25 we examined the ability of ra59s 939 to induce cell fusion cells were infected with ra59s 939 or the isogenic control virus and monolayers were fixed at different times post infection nuclei were stained with dapi and visualized by fluorescent microscopy and photographed the average number of nuclei contained in multinucleated giant cells per high-powered field was used as a measure of cell fusion for cultures infected with the ra59s 939 mutant the average number of nuclei contained in syncytia per field was decreased approximately four-fold compared to cultures infected by the wild type strain and stained at nine hours post infection fig 7
 as was the case with our prior mutants the spike proteins containing the 910939 mutations were immunoprecipitated by the fcii receptor antibody 24g2 as well as the wild type s protein supplemental fig s1 indicating that the alterations in these sites didnt interfere with the mhv-a59 spike proteins ability to mimic of fcrii in this work we undertook a mutational study to attempt to identify sites within the mhv s protein that were responsible for its molecular mimicry of the murine fc gamma receptor mfcrii and mfcriii three sequences at positions 546548 554546 and 581586 within the spike glycoprotein were candidates to play a role in the recognition of the s protein by the monoclonal anti-mfcriimfcriii antibody 24g2 because they were conserved in regions of modest amino acid sequence similarity to mfcrii these sequences were targeted by alanine replacement mutagenesis attempts to determine the reactivity of mutants of the mhv s protein with anti- mfcriimfcriii antibody 24g2 in transfection experiments were problematical largely due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient expression levels to obtain robust and reproducible immunoprecipitation reactions of s protein wild type or mutant expressed by pcagg-s with this antibody data not shown however the expression level obtained was sufficiently high for us to perform immunoprecipitation reactions with two conformation-dependent anti-mhv-a59 s monoclonal antibodies gilmore et al 1987 to identify mutations that had major effects on s protein folding s protein carrying the r546ac547aq548a mutation s 546548 was poorly recognized by these conformation-dependent antibodies and the s1 and s2 cleavage products of s were not detected at all suggesting that this mutation had a major effect on s protein folding in contrast s protein carrying alanine substitution mutations in r546 and q548 but not in c547 was recognized by both of the conformation-dependent antibodies implicating c547 as being necessary for proper folding of the s protein this was further supported by our inability to recover a recombinant virus carrying the s 546548 mutation whereas the s 546548 virus was easily recovered by targeted recombination some strains of mhv either viruses recovered in nature such as mhv-a59 or selected as escape mutants from monoclonal antibody neutralization parker et al 1989 contain deletions of the s protein relative to the long s proteins found in the mhv-jhm or mhv-s strains the jhm-x strain contains the longest deletion in the s1 domain amongst these deletion variants and c547 is the first amino acid on the c-terminal side of the deletion taguchi and fleming 1989 furthermore an alignment of mhv and mfcrii shows absolute conservation of this amino acid amongst all strains of mhv and its location in the secondary predicted structure fig 8
 we think it likely that c547 participates in a disulfide bridge that is important for proper folding of the s1 domain in addition because the deletion in jhm-x is substantial 153 amino acids and deletes 15 cysteine residues n-terminal of c547 we think it likely that the partner cysteine to c547 lies somewhere between c547 and the s1s2 cleavage site at positions 717 and 718 recovery of recombinant viruses containing the s 546548 mutation allowed us to determine that alanine replacement of the arginine and glutamine at these two residues did not affect the ability of the s protein to be recognized by the 24g2 anti-mfcriimfcriii antibody and thus that this region of sequence similarity was unlikely to be involved in molecular mimicry of fcrii the mutational studies of the other two regions of sequence similarity between fcrii and the mhv s protein at positions 554556 and 581586 also failed to identify the epitope that was shared between these two proteins in the case of the alanine replacement mutations at s residues 554556 we were able to recover a virus carrying these mutations by targeted recombination and test its reactivity with 24g2 for the alanine replacement mutations in s at residues 581586 this was not possible because we failed to recover a mutant virus by targeted recombination these mutations altered the pattern of reactivity of mutant s protein with two conformation-dependent anti-a59 s antibodies indicating that s protein carrying this mutation likely was not folded correctly thus we cannot exclude the possibility that the residues at 581586 are part of the epitope recognized by 24g2 a comparative bioinformatics approach comparing the sequence from the s proteins of hcov-oc43 a group 2a beta-coronavirus that does not exhibit molecular mimicry of fcrii with the sequences of the very closely related bcov and with the mhv s protein both of which exhibit this property identified three potential targets for mutagenesis of these three mutants two va59s 562589 and va59s 667687 contained mutations located in the s1 domain both gave rise to viable viruses although with somewhat impaired replication but both mutant s proteins were immunoreactive with the 24g2 anti-mfcriimfcriii antibody and thus the two regions targeted by our mutations were unlikely to be involved in molecular mimicry of fcrii our third mutant containing n910k and p939l mutations was located in the s2 domain although this double point mutation did not have alter the molecular mimicry properties of the s protein immunoreactivity with 24g2 anti-mfcriimfcriii antibody the mutation had a marked effect on plaque size growth kinetics and rate of cell fusion these effects were determined to largely reside with the p939l mutation a residue that is 29 amino acids n-terminal to the first heptad repeat domain 9681027 within the s2 fragment the sequences between positions 929 and 944 which contain p939 have been suggested to contain the putative mhv fusion peptide chambers et al 1990 this assignment is controversial in that replacement of several amino acids in the putative fusion peptide did not appear to affect the fusion properties of the s protein though p939 was not tested in these studies luo and weiss 1998 the data in our studies is consistent with the hypothesis that p939 plays a role in the fusion properties of mhv-a59 and strengths the possibility of this region contains the fusion peptide alternatively our data do not rule out the possibility that the p939l mutation either decreases the stability of the s protein or the rate of transport of s protein to the plasma membrane and thus decreases cell fusion through of those two mechanisms however we think it less likely that the p939l mutation has a major effect on s protein stability because this residue is present in an equivalent position in the hcov-oc43 s protein hcov-oc43 also does not induce cellcell fusion during infection these studies ultimately failed to identify mutations in the mhv s protein that abolished molecular mimicry of mfcrii as judged by immunoreactivity with the 24g2 anti-mfcriimfcriii antibody there are several possibilities for this result one being that the residues involved with molecular mimicry are not linear but are brought together in space as a result of secondary and tertiary structure in s as is the case for the fc binding site formed by ge and gi complex in hsv sprague et al 2006 xu-bin murayama et al 1989 other potential explanations include a crucial role for residues making up the fc binding site in the correct folding of the s protein making it difficult to identify mutants that fold correctly and have defects in fc binding activity there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest  mechanisms of coronavirus cell entry mediated by the viral spike protein sandrine belouzard jean millet k beth licitra n gary whittaker r   although the first member of the coronavirus family was discovered in the 1930s 1 coronaviruses gained particular notoriety when the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak shook the world in 20022003 interest in this family of viruses grew in the aftermath of this epidemic leading to the identification of many new family members this episode also shed light on the capabilities of coronaviruses to jump across species before gaining importance for public health in 2003 the diseases associated with coronaviruses were mainly of veterinary interest coronaviruses infect a wide variety of mammals and birds causing respiratory and enteric diseases and in some rarer cases hepatitis and neurologic disease infection can be acute or persistent 2 coronaviruses are classified in four different genera historically based on serological analysis and now on genetic studies alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-cov table 1 coronaviruses belong to the coronavirinae subfamily that together with torovirinae form the coronaviridae family in the nidovirales order coronaviruses are enveloped spherical or pleiomorphic viruses with typical sizes ranging from 80 to 120 nm they possess a 5 capped single-strand positive sense rna genome with a length between 262 and 317 kb the longest amongst all rna viruses the genome is composed of six to ten open reading frames orfs the first orf comprises two-thirds of the genome and encodes the replicase proteins whereas the last third contains the structural protein genes in a fixed order he-s-e-m-n figure 1a variable numbers of orf encoding accessory proteins are present between these genes the genome is packaged into a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by a host-derived lipid bilayer the virion envelope contains at least three viral proteins the spike protein s the membrane protein m and the envelope protein e figure 1b in addition some coronaviruses also contain a hemagglutinin esterase he whereas the m and e proteins are involved in virus assembly the spike protein is the leading mediator of viral entry the spike protein is also the principal player in determining host range 34  viral entry relies on a fine interplay between the virion and the host cell infection is initiated by interaction of the viral particle with specific proteins on the cell surface after initial binding of the receptor enveloped viruses need to fuse their envelope with the host cell membrane to deliver their nucleocapsid to the target cell the spike protein plays a dual role in entry by mediating receptor binding and membrane fusion the fusion process involves large conformational changes of the spike protein coronaviruses use a variety of receptors and triggers to activate fusion however fundamental aspects that enable this initial step of the viral life cycle are conserved in this review we will address entry strategies of coronaviruses and how these mechanisms are related to host tropism and pathogenicity the spike protein is a large type i transmembrane protein ranging from 1160 amino acids for avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv and up to 1400 amino acids for feline coronavirus fcov in addition this protein is highly glycosylated as it contains 21 to 35 n-glycosylation sites spike proteins assemble into trimers on the virion surface to form the distinctive corona or crown-like appearance the ectodomain of all cov spike proteins share the same organization in two domains a n-terminal domain named s1 that is responsible for receptor binding and a c-terminal s2 domain responsible for fusion figures 2 and 3 a notable distinction between the spike proteins of different coronaviruses is whether it is cleaved or not during assembly and exocytosis of virions with some exceptions in most alphacoronaviruses and the betacoronavirus sars-cov the virions harbor a spike protein that is uncleaved whereas in some beta- and all gammacoronaviruses the protein is found cleaved between the s1 and s2 domains typically by furin a golgi-resident host protease figure 2 interestingly within the betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv species different strains such as mhv-2 and mhv-a59 display different cleavage requirements this has important consequences on their fusogenicity as detailed in section 4 the s2 subunit is the most conserved region of the protein whereas the s1 subunit diverges in sequence even among species of a single coronavirus the s1 contains two subdomains a n-terminal domain ntd and a c-terminal domain ctd both are able to function as receptor binding domains rbds and bind variety of proteins and sugars  the coronavirus spike protein is a class i fusion protein 5 the formation of an -helical coiledcoil structure is characteristic of this class of fusion protein which contain in their c-terminal part regions predicted to have an -helical secondary structure and to form coiled-coils influenza hemagglutinin protein ha is the prototypical member of the class i fusion protein family and one of the best characterized so far 6 ha is synthesized as a ha0 precursor and assembles into trimers the protein becomes fusion competent by cleavage of ha0 into ha1 and ha2 the fusion peptide a very conserved hydrophobic sequence is located at the n-terminus of ha2 in the pre-fusion conformation the central coiled-coil of the trimer is formed by three long helices with three shorter helices packed around them in this conformation the fusion peptide is protected buried within the trimer interface two major conformation changes occur during fusion upon endosomal acidification an unstructured linker becomes helical allowing formation of a long helix in the n-terminal part in this conformation called a prehairpin the fusion peptide is projected towards the target membrane where it is then embedded connecting the viral and target cell membranes the second conformational change consists of the inversion of the c-helix that packs into the grooves of the n-terminal trimeric coiled-coils forming a six-helix bundle 6hb in the resulting conformation the transmembrane domain and the fusion peptide anchored into the target membrane are brought in close proximity facilitating merging of viral and cell membranes coronavirus spike proteins contain two heptad repeats in their s2 domain a feature typical of a class i viral fusion proteins heptad repeats comprise a repetitive heptapeptide abcdefg with a and d being hydrophobic residues characteristic of the formation of coiled-coil that participate in the fusion process for sars-cov and mhv the post-fusion structures of the hr have been solved they form the characteristic six-helix bundle 78 the functional role of mhv and sars-cov hr was confirmed by mutating key residues and by inhibition experiments using hr2 peptides 910  the important role of the spike protein in cell tropism has been demonstrated with chimeric viruses there are many strains of mouse hepatitis virus mhv viruses that infect mainly the brain and liver because of the different patterns of disease associated with the various strains of mhv involvement of their spike protein in tissue tropism has been extensively studied the strain jhm is highly virulent causing severe encephalitis that is often lethal but is poorly hepatotropic the strain mhv-a59 causes hepatitis and mild encephalitis mhv-2 is highly hepatotropic by using chimeric viruses between these different strains it has been shown that the s protein is linked to the tropism and pathogenesis of mhv introduction of jhm or mhv-2 s genes in the mhv-a59 background increases the recombinant virus neurovirulence and hepatotropism respectively 1112 however replacement of jhm s protein sequence with mhv-a59 s gene in the jhm background does not confer hepatotropism suggesting that other factors modulate virus tropism a mutant mhv-a59 strain exhibiting altered tropism was isolated from persistently infected microglial cells 13 the single mutation q159l in the s1 domain is responsible for reduced replication in the liver and low hepatotropism of the virus 14 the important role of the spike protein in tropism has also been shown for other coronaviruses ibv is an important domestic fowl pathogen that replicates in the respiratory tract but also in epithelial cells from the kidney the oviduct and the gut in vitro clinical strains of ibv infect only chicken embryo kidney cells and grow on embryonated eggs ibv beaudette strain is an attenuated strain that was obtained by serial passage of ibv on eggs ibv beaudette in addition to chicken embryo kidney cells also infects cef bhk-21 and vero cells substitution of the s gene in the beaudette background with that of the ibv m41 strain restricts the tropism of the virus to primary chicken cells 15 however in vivo this chimeric virus has the attenuated phenotype of beaudette these data show that change in tropism of beaudette in cell culture is mainly determined by the s protein though the avirulence also results from attenuating mutations in other genes 16  feline coronaviruses fcov provide a fascinating example of the critical involvement of the spike protein in tropism and pathogenesis 17 within this alphacoronavirus species there are two known serotypes 1 and 2 based on serological and genetic characteristics of their spike furthermore there are two biotypes within each serotype both of which are associated with extremely contrasting pathological potential cats get commonly infected with the feline enteric coronavirus fecv a biotype that gives rise to usually asymptomatic to mild enteric tract infections and may establish persistence in the host in contrast some fcov-infected cats sporadically develop an invariably fatal immune-mediated disease called feline infectious peritonitis fip in this case the causative agent is called feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv a striking characteristic of fipvs that sets them apart from fecvs is their ability to efficiently replicate in monocytes and macrophages 18 it is thought that this switch in tropism from gut epithelium to motile monocytesmacrophages cells is a crucial tipping point towards the development of fip as it allows for viral dissemination throughout the host the current understanding is that mutations in fecv in a persistently infected host cause it to change into the virulent fipv 19 while it has been hypothesized that mutations or deletions in certain genes such as 3c and 7b may be associated with the emergence of fipv 19 the causative mutations for the biotype switch are still unknown there is however evidence that mutations in the spike gene may play key role in the transition of tropism from gut epithelium to macrophages rottier and colleagues have focused on the genetically close and laboratory-adapted type 2 fecv 791683 and fipv 791146 pair 20 while both viruses have similar growth characteristics in established feline epithelial cells only fipv 791146 but not fecv 791683 has the ability to efficiently infect and replicate in macrophages using a targeted rna recombination system 21 the authors were able to generate recombinant chimeric virus to determine regions of the genome that are important for infection of bone marrow derived macrophages they found that the exchange of the fipv 791146 s gene with that of fecv 791683 in the fipv 791146 genetic background strongly reduced the chimeric recombinant virus capacity to infect macrophages compared to the recombinant wild type fipv 791146 furthermore additional chimeras were generated to more precisely map the regions of spike that are important for macrophage tropism surprisingly the c-terminal region of the spike from residue 874 to the c-terminus but not the n-terminal region which contains the s1 receptor binding domain was found to be responsible for the macrophage tropism in this system a total of ten amino acid substitution differentiates the c-terminal regions of fecv 791683 and fipv 791146 however the precise mutations that cause the tropism switch remains to be determined 20 while serotype 2 fcov have been studied in a relatively detailed manner in particular because they propagate more easily in vitro serotype 1 fcov which are more relevant clinically as they are more prevalent are less well understood and although it can be assumed that viruses of both serotypes behave in similar ways for most of their life cycle it remains to be investigated whether the same or different set of mutations would account for the biotype switch in the two serotypes thus more efforts are needed to study serotype 1 fcov such efforts would shed light on the basis of fcov pathogenesis the difference in tropism mediated by s proteins results from different mechanisms linked to the two main functions of the protein receptor binding and fusion which will be further discussed the first coronavirus receptor identified was the mhv receptor in 1991 22 mhv binds to the adhesion molecule ceacam1 carcinoembryonic antigen-cell adhesion molecule to infect cells ceacam1 is a type i transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ceacam1 is a multifunctional protein that has roles in adhesion and cell signaling among others the ceacam1 ectodomain contains four ig constant region like domains n a1 b and a2 the nterminal domain n of ceacam1 is involved in mhv binding 2324 there are two allelic forms of ceacam1 ceacam1a and ceacam1b they can both function as receptors however binding by ceacam1a is much more efficient 23 the involvement of receptor usage and tropism of mhv strains have been studied it has been shown that neurovirulence of jhm is associated with rapid spread of the virus in the brain that is partly independent of ceacam1 in vitro mhv-jhm requires ceacam1 for entry however in vivo jhm is able to infect ceacam mice but with a 100-fold higher lethal dose 25 as a consequence it has been suggested that jhm in the absence of ceacam1 uses an alternative less effective and yet to be determined receptor in order to initiate infection after primary infection the virus could propagate very rapidly by using cell-cell fusion independently of the receptor receptor independent spread 26 in vivo mhv-a59 is strictly dependent on ceacam1 for infection 27 but persistent infection of murine cells leads to the emergence of viruses with extended tropism 28 the mhvbhk virus infects cells in a heparan sulfate-dependent and ceacam1-independent manner because of the acquisition of two heparan sulfate binding sites in the s protein 2930 it has been shown that both binding sites are required to acquire the ceacam1-independent phenotype 30 for jhm strain many isolates exist that differ in their neurovirulence levels the virulence is correlated to the length of a hypervariable region present within s1 the isolate mhv-4 of jhm contains the longest region and it is associated with independent ceacam1 cell-cell fusion and spread 31 it has been suggested that conformational changes of the spike protein are facilitated by a less stable association of the s1 and s2 subunits 32 this suggests that the higher the fusogenic potential of the spike protein is the less the virus depends on its receptor for entry  among alphacoronaviruses two human viruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 can be found along with viruses that infect animals and can be responsible of severe illness transmissible gastroenteritis cov tgev and canine cov ccov cause enteric disease in pigs and dogs respectively while feline coronaviruses cause enteric and systemic disease in cats hcov-229e tgev serotype 2 fcov and ccov all use the aminopeptidase n apn protein of their natural host as receptor interestingly in addition to their specific host apn these viruses are able to bind the feline apn it has been suggested that these viruses may have originated from a common ancestor coronavirus infecting felines that used apn as a receptor 2 apn also known as cd13 is a type ii transmembrane protein expressed on the apical domain of epithelial cells of respiratory and enteric tracts apn is a zn2 dependent protease that preferentially degrades peptides or proteins with a n-terminal neutral amino acid it has been shown that tropism differences of these viruses are due to the ability of their spike proteins to recognize small species-specific amino acid differences in apn 33 spike proteins of hcov-229e tgev fcov and ccov present a high homology however binding domains are located in non-homologous regions  tgev infects epithelial cells from the small intestine but is also able to infect cells from the respiratory tract in the mid-1980s an attenuated variant of tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcov was isolated in belgium this virus provides an example of altered tissue tropism due to a deletion occurring in the spike gene 34 unlike tgev prcov infects only pulmonary epithelial cells both spike proteins bind porcine apn the receptor binding domain being located between residues 522 and 744 of tgev s protein the spike protein of tgev has a hemagglutinating activity that is absent in prcov as this activity is contained in the deleted n-terminal part of the protein 35 one of the consequences of this lack of activity is the inability of prcov to replicate in the gut the hemagglutinating activity was mapped to the residues 145155 of tgev spike protein and it has been shown that a mutation abrogating this activity reduced the enteropathogenicity of the virus 36 in addition a study has shown that the sialic acid binding activity of tgev is responsible for binding of an additional protein designated as mucin-like glycoprotein mpg in brush border membranes 37 it has been suggested that this binding might shield the virus from the action of gut emulsifiers 38 the role of the ntd and carbohydrate binding in tgev provides interesting insights into coronavirus enterotropism a property that generally is attributed to non-enveloped viruses the role of the ntd in other enteric alphacoronaviruses such as fcov and canine coronavirus ccov is still unknown  other coronaviruses have sialic acid binding activity in particular bovine coronavirus bcov and human hcov-oc43 39 the ability of betacoronaviruses to bind carbohydrates has been mapped to a galectin fold-like structure present in the s1 ntd 40 so far besides the binding of neu59ac2 conjugates no other specific receptors have been identified for these viruses they belong to the betacoronavirus group and contain he proteins so they resemble influenza virus as they have a receptor-destroying enzyme however the exact role of he during coronavirus entry remains unclear ibv also exhibits sialic acid binding activity but the role of such activity in pathogenicity is not known for ibv extended host range of beaudette strains in cell culture has been linked to the presence of a heparin binding site in the spike protein 41  another example of heparan sulfate binding is found with type 1 fcov spike by incubating viruses with heparin-agarose beads heparin has a very similar structure to heparan sulfate and is used in binding assays de haan and colleagues have demonstrated by quantification of bead-associated viral rna that the cell-culture-adapted type 1 fipv ucd1 strain can bind heparin 42 very interestingly the putative heparin binding motif proposed by the authors resides in a defective furin cleavage site at the boundary between the s1 and s2 domains the type 2 fipv 791146 as well as the ucd1-related type 1 fipv ucd which harbors a functional furin cleavage site were not able to bind the heparin beads this lends support to the notion that an uncleaved heparan sulfate recognition motif is required for binding activity furthermore the authors found that inoculation of ucd1 to fcwf cells in the presence of competing heparin severely diminished infection infection by type 2 fipv 791146 was not affected by this heparin competition assay as mentioned above the coronavirus spike proteinreceptor pairing is a key determinant of tropism to infect a new host species coronaviruses must adapt to the receptor of their new host either by mutation or by recombination with a coronavirus infecting their new host in the case of sars-cov the virus appeared in 2002 in live animal retail markets in china related viruses were isolated from himalayan palm civets raccoon dogs and chinese ferrets however it is believed that these animals were not the reservoir of the virus but intermediate hosts during the species-jumping event the receptor of the sars-cov is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 43 ace2 is a type i integral membrane protein abundantly expressed in lung tissue it is a mono-carboxypeptidase that hydrolyses angiotensin ii human and himalayan palm civet coronavirus receptor usage analyses have shown that human sars-cov can bind both human and palm civet ace2 whereas the palm civet virus cannot bind hace2 it has been shown that adaptation of the virus to humans was due to two point mutations k479n and s487t in the binding domain of the sars-cov s protein 44 further characterization by wu et al of adaptive mutations of the rbd led to the identification of mutations that strengthen the interaction with either human or palm civet ace2 45 sars-cov-like viruses have been isolated in bats in this case entry does not occur via ace2 and their receptors isare unknown however replacement of the amino acid sequence found between residues 323 and 505 with the corresponding sequence of the sars-cov rbd is sufficient to allow human ace2 receptor usage 46 coronaviruses are able to exploit many cell surface moleculesproteins and carbohydrates alikein order to gain entry into target cells host calcium dependent c-type lectins have been recognized to play a role in infection by sars-cov ibv and fcov dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin dc-sign is a c-type lectin expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells its function is to recognize high mannose glycosylation patterns commonly found on viral and bacterial pathogens viral exploitation of dc-sign is best documented in hiv-1 which attaches via n-glycosylated residues on the surface of the virus hiv-1 uses dc-sign to subvert the host immune defenses by entering and initiating infection of dendritic cells or macrophages directly in-cis or by traveling with the cell to lymph nodes where the virus is transferred to t-cells at the immunological synapse in-trans like hiv-1 gp120 the coronavirus spike is heavily glycosylated providing the virus with the opportunity to interact with host lectins such as dcl-sign l-sign which is expressed on endothelial cells of the liver as well as in the lung has been reported to be an alternate receptor for sars-cov and hcov-229e 4748 in-trans transmission of sars-cov by dendritic cells to susceptible target cells has been documented although the dendritic cells studied were capable of transferring infectious virions via a synapse-like structure in-cis infection was not observed 49 site directed mutagenesis has identified glycosylation at the asparagine residues 109 118 119 158 227 589 and 699 as critical for l-signdc-sign mediated entry 50  fipv is an example of a coronavirus that targets immune cellsspecifically monocytes and macrophagesto achieve systemic spread infection of non-permissive cell types was achieved through exogenous expression of dc-sign demonstrating that both type 1 and type 2 fipvs use dcsign as a co-receptor or as an alternative receptor to fapn respectively 5152 in the case of ibv experiments have demonstrated that dc-sign and the closely related l-sign enhance infection of otherwise non-permissive cells in a sialic acid-independent fashion 53 the role of lectins in ibv infection in vivo is undetermined  enveloped virus entry can occur directly at the cell surface after binding to the receptor or after internalization via endocytosis with fusion taking place in the endosomal compartment fusion of viral membranes with host membranes is driven by large conformational changes of the spike protein over time coronaviruses have modified their spike proteins leading to the diversity of triggers used to activate their fusion these conformational changes can be initiated by receptor binding but may need additional triggers such as ph acidification or proteolytic activation the mechanisms of coronavirus entry are complex and differ between coronavirus species and strains for example depending on the mhv strain fusion can occur directly at the cell surface after receptor binding or after endocytosis jhm strain mhv-4 fuses at neutral ph but the virus was also detected in endosomal vesicles 54 it is likely that mhv-4 is capable of entering directly at the cell surface or through the endosomal pathway the choice of entry mechanism may depend on the cell type in both cases fusion is solely triggered by receptor binding indeed it has been shown that incubation of jhm spike protein with a soluble form of the receptor ceacam1 induces modifications in s hydrophobicity and conformational change of the s2 region 555657 in addition jhm is able to spread from dbt cells to bhk cells that do not express the mhv receptor incubation with soluble receptor increases this receptor-independent propagation 58 the capacity of the spike protein to fuse at neutral ph relies on the properties of the fusion machinery a variant of mhv-4 isolated from persistently infected cells requires low ph exposure for productive infection the difference of ph requirement for fusion between the mutant and the wild type virus was attributed to three point mutations in the heptad repeat regions 59 concerning mhv-a59 entry mechanisms contradictory results have been reported qui et al reported that parental strain of mhv-a59 was insensitive to lysomotropic agent whereas the recombinant strain containing the mhv-2 spike protein relies on low ph for entry 60 indeed mhv2 entry requires low-ph-activated endosomal proteases cathepsin b and l and if a cleavage site is introduced in mhv-2 spike protein virus entry no longer requires these proteases these data are in favor of ph-independent fusion induced by receptor binding eifart et al challenged this scenario combining different approaches of infection and microscopy the authors have shown that mhv-a59 infection is sensitive to lysomotropic agent and that the virus is internalized allowing initiation of infection suggesting that ph acidification is required to trigger viral fusion 61 it is likely that receptor binding is a key determinant of mhv entry however the requirement for an additional fusion trigger remains unclear for mhv-2 the endocytosis mechanism was further characterized the virus is internalized by a clathrin-dependent pathway that does not depend on the eps15 adaptor 62 endosomal ph acidification is a fusion trigger for many viruses such as influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus vsv for many years it was believed that ibv fusion occurs at neutral ph as infected cells form large syncytia at neutral ph however it has been shown by chu et al that infection is blocked by lysomotropic agent and that ibv fusion process was activated by low ph 63 the authors directly assessed the ph dependence of ibv fusion in fluorescence dequenching assays they showed that fusion occurs at acidic ph with a half-maximal fusion rate occurring at ph 55 in order to infect cells ibv enters by endocytosis inhibitory drugs of the clathrin-mediated pathway such as chlorpromazine also abolished ibv infection ibv virions harbor cleaved spike proteins with the cleavage occurring between the s1 and s2 domains the ibv beaudette strain has the peculiar feature to contain a second furin cleavage site in the s2 domain of the spike infection and syncytia formation is inhibited by the presence of a furin inhibitor mutation or deletion of the s1s2 cleavage site in beaudette spike protein delays virus propagation but does not abolish syncytia formation these mutants are still sensitive to furin inhibition mutants containing a minimal cleavage site xxxr690s are infectious however they are dependent on serine proteases for productive infection 64  the relationship between the cleavability of the coronavirus spike protein and its fusogenicity has been a source of debate for researchers for many years when viral fusion proteins are expressed at the cell surface activation of viral fusion results in cell-cell fusion and formation of giant multinucleated cells named syncytia it is generally believed that syncytia formation which involves cell membranes fusing together reflects the fusion process between viral and host cell membranes however it now appears that cell-cell and virus-cell fusion mechanisms may differ indeed because of differences in factors such as membrane curvature andor density of viral envelope glycoproteins the processes involved in cell-cell and virus-cell fusion may considerably differ mechanistically furthermore formation of syncytia in infected cells is not observed with all coronaviruses cleavage of the fusion protein is a common characteristic of class i viral fusion proteins for influenza the nature of the cleavage site of ha is of great importance in virus pathogenicity the cleavage event required to prime the protein for fusion can occur in the secretion pathway by furin or during infection by host proteases of the respiratory tract influenza virus strains that are cleaved by host furin are highly pathogenic as they cause systemic infection 65 for coronaviruses the relationship between cleavage of the s protein and its cell-cell fusion capability has been well established cleaved proteins show a higher propensity for cell-cell fusion introduction of a mutation h716d in the spike protein of mhv-a59 strongly impaired the cleavage of the protein and delayed cell-cell fusion 66 mhv-2 strain spike protein is not cleaved and mutation of the sequence of mhv-a59 cleavage site with the corresponding sequence of mhv-2 s protein delays cell-cell fusion introduction of a cleavage site in mhv-2 spike protein induces the formation of syncytia at neutral ph in vitro spike protein cleavage plays an important role in fusogenicity however the role in virus-fusion and pathogenicity is less clear for example mhv-a59 bearing the mutation h716d is very similar to the wild type virus in terms of pathogenicity 67 mhv-a59 viral stock produced in presence of a furin inhibitor to block spike cleavage enters cells with kinetics similar to the wild type virus 68 moreover a study by hingley and collaborators has shown that the spike of virus purified from liver homogenates of mhv-a59-infected mice was not cleaved further adding evidence that proteolytic processing of spike is not essential for entry and spread in vivo 69 for coronaviruses that have a spike that is cleaved by furin it is important to note that this protease belongs to a family of enzymes called proprotein convertases pcs which has nine members 70 along with furin six other pcs proteases pc1 pc2 pc4 pc5 pace4 and pc7 share the same basic recognition motif rk-x0246-rk where x is any amino acid 71 it remains to be determined whether other pcs that are related to furin can also recognize and cleave coronavirus spike proteins  for some coronaviruses that harbor a non-cleaved spike protein on their surface such as mhv-2 and sars-cov it has been shown that they rely on endosomal proteases for productive entry indeed mhv-2 entry depends on host cell cathepsin l and b 60 this dependence is abolished by the introduction of a furin cleavage site between the s1 and s2 domains for sars-cov the link between cleavage and fusion is more complex table 2 it has been shown that sars-cov infection is inhibited by lysomotropic agents because of the inhibition of the low-ph-actived protease cathepsin l 72 in addition cell-cell and virus-cell fusion can be triggered by trypsin treatment 73 this led to the hypothesis that sars-cov fusion was triggered by proteolytic processing of the spike protein it has been shown that different proteases enhance sars-cov infection in vitro trypsin thermolysin and elastase 74 analysis of sars-cov spike protein processing by trypsin and elastase had shed light on sars-cov fusion 7576 it was shown that trypsin activates fusion by sequential cleavage of the spike protein at two discrete sites the first cleavage event at the s1s2 boundary r667 probably facilitates the second cleavage event at the position r797 s2 region that is responsible for fusion activation 7577 the second cleavage occurs directly at the n-terminal extremity of the fusion peptide cleavage at r667 is dispensable for fusion activation but enhances cell-cell or virus-cell fusion elastase mediates cleavage at the residue t795 not directly next to the fusion peptide sarscov spike protein shows a certain degree of plasticity in the position of the cleavage site for priming of fusion conversely when influenza ha is cleaved by pseudomonas elastase the cleavage position is shifted by one amino acid which leads to fusion incompetency 78 sars-cov s residue 795 is probably less accessible for cleavage than residue 797 and the fusion induced by cleavage at position 797 is more efficient the difference of fusion efficacy may also result from its location at the n-terminus of the fusion peptide these data suggest that fusion is modulated by spatial regulation of the cleavage site it has been shown that cathepsin l cleaves the sars-cov spike protein in the s1s2 boundary region at residue t678 however so far cleavage in the s2 region has yet to be conclusively demonstrated 79 sars-cov is able to fuse directly at the cell surface in the presence of relevant exogenous protease it is believed that this route of entry is 100- to 1000-fold more efficient than the endosomal pathway 74 the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is a key factor of tropism sarscov is a respiratory pathogen and it has been known for a long time that proteases from the respiratory tract such as members of the transmembrane proteaseserine subfamily tmprss tmprss2 or hat tmprss11d are able to cleave influenza ha 80 indeed tmprss2 and hat or tmprss11d are both able to induce sars-cov fusion 81828384 infection of target cells with sars-cov s-pseudotyped virions is less sensitive to cathepsin inhibitors when target cells express tmprss2 8384 sars-cov s-pseudotyped virions produced in cells expressing tmprss2 still rely on endosomal cathepsin for entry while they are less sensitive to neutralizing antibodies this effect was attributed to the release of spike fragments in the supernatant that lure antibodies and may be of great importance for the spread of the virus 83 it has been shown that processing of the spike protein by hat and tmprss2 may differ hat cleaves the sars-cov s protein mainly at r667 whereas tmprss2 cleaves the protein at multiple sites notably in a region near s2 although the precise locations of the cleavage sites for this protease remain to be determined 81 expression of hat in target cells does not confer nh4cl or cathepsin inhibitor resistance to sars-cov spseudotyped virion entry 84 it is likely that spatial and temporal modulation of activation by proteases play important roles cleavage of incoming virions before their binding to the cell would probably abort infection by inactivating the virion interestingly tmprss2 is associated with ace2 the sars-cov receptor 81 tmprss2 likely plays a key role in the initial infection and spread of the virus however the importance of this protease on sars-cov infection results from a fine balance between two antagonist effects on infection shedding of the receptor and fusion activation for fcov a well-studied case for the role of proteolytic activation of spike comes from research on the type 2 fcov pair fecv 791683 and fipv 791146 86 by using specific cathepsin inhibitors the authors have shown that the two strains differ substantially in their use of activating proteases used during entry while the fecv strain 791683 was found to rely on both cathepsin b and l as well as on an acidic endosomal environment the fipv strain 791146 was dependent on cathepsin b activity only this was further confirmed by a biochemical assay that found that fecv 791683 can be cleaved by cathepsin b and l whereas fipv 791146 could only be cleaved by cathepsin b based on the molecular weights of the cathepsin cleavage products it was hypothesized that the cleavage site did not reside in the boundary region between the s1 and s2 domain but in a region located in the cterminal part of s2 86 a critical feature of any viral fusion protein is the so-called fusion peptide which is a relatively apolar region of 1525 amino acids that interacts with membranes and plays an essential role in the fusion reaction 68788 fusion peptides of class i viral fusion proteins are typically classified as external or internal depending on their location relative to the proteolytic cleavage site 89 one key feature of viral fusion peptides is that within a particular virus family there is high conservation of amino acid residues however there is little similarity between fusion peptides of different virus families 90 in the case of influenza ha which is a classic example of an external fusion peptide the n- and c-terminal parts of the fusion peptide which are -helical penetrate the outer leaflet of the target membrane with a kink at the phospholipid surface the inside of the kink contains hydrophobic amino acids with charged residues on the outer face 91 internal fusion peptides such as the one found in the ebola virus gp often consist of loops but also require a mixture of hydrophobic and flexible residues similar to n-terminal fusion peptides 8792 it is important to note that despite the presence of key hydrophobic residues viral fusion peptides often do not display extensive stretches of hydrophobicity and can contain one or more charged residues 93  to date the exact location and sequence of the coronavirus fusion peptide is not known 94 however by analogy with other class i viral fusion proteins it is predicted to be in the s2 domain the location of the fusion peptide has been most extensively studied for sars-cov three membranotropic regions in sars-cov s2 were originally suggested as potential fusion peptides 9596 based on sequence analysis and a hydrophobicity analysis of the s protein using the wimley-white ww interfacial hydrophobic interface scale initial indications were that the sars-cov fusion peptide resided in the n-terminal part of hr1 597 which is conserved across the coronaviridae mutagenesis of this predicted fusion peptide inhibited fusion in syncytia assays of s-expressing cells 98 this region of sars-cov has also been analyzed by other groups in biochemical assays 9699100 and was defined as the ww ii region residues 864886although sainz et al 99 actually identified another less conserved and less hydrophobic region ww i residues 770778 as being most important for fusion peptides corresponding to this region have also been studied in biochemical assays by other groups 101 in addition a third aromatic region adjacent to the transmembrane domain the membrane-proximal domain has been shown to be important in sars-cov fusion 102103104105 this membrane-proximal domain likely acts in concert with a fusion peptide in the s2 ectodomain to mediate final bilayer fusion once conformational changes have exposed the fusion peptide in the ectodomain based on the finding that sars-cov s can be proteolytically cleaved at a downstream position in s2 at residue 797 757677 further investigations were carried out to determine whether cleavage at this internal position in s2 might expose a domain with properties of a viral fusion peptide a mutagenesis study of sars-cov s residues 798815 a stretch located in between the ww i and ww ii regions combined with lipid-mixing and structural studies of an isolated peptide showed the importance of this region as a novel fusion peptide for sars-cov the sequence immediately cterminal to the r797 cleavage site of sars-cov s is sfiedllfnkvtladagf and it is notable that both r797 and this downstream sequence are highly conserved across the coronaviridae in particular the iedllf motif showed only minimal divergence with occasional conservative substitutions 106 examination of the proposed iedllf fusion peptide in the context of a structural model of the sars-cov s homotrimer shows that it is externally positioned mid-way down the trimer and as such would appear to be appropriately located to function as a fusion peptide notably l803 l804 and f805 are the initial residues of a major antigenic determinant of sars-cov s leu 803ala 828 that is capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies 107 this sars-cov epitope is also homologous to an immunodominant neutralizing domain the 5b19 epitope on the mhv s2 subunit 108 while a crystal structure of the sars-cov s ectodomain has not yet be solved a predictive model of the quaternary structure is available pdb entry 1t7g 109 in the context of this model the novel s2 fusion peptide is mainly helical especially the conserved residues sxiedllf with a short central unstructured region and is in a relatively exposed position mid-way down the trimeric spike protein complex figure 3 this structure and position within the s trimer is consistent with its function as a viral fusion peptide comparisons with other fusion proteins reveal some similarities to the internal fusion peptides of ebola virus and avian leukosis virus like these viruses the coronavirus fusion peptide is exposed by proteolytic cleavage 689110 yet is not a classic external fusion peptide like influenza ha in the past ten years many new coronaviruses have been identified they infect a wide range of hosts from mammals to birds closely related coronaviruses have been identified in distantly related animals suggesting recent interspecies jumps coronavirus diversity is fundamentally due to the low fidelity of the virally encoded rna-dependent-rna-polymerase that generates around 103 to 105 substitutions per site per year the large size and replication strategy of the coronavirus genome also allows for frequent homologous recombination a process that enables exchange of genetic material during co-infection persistent infection leads to the accumulation of adaptive mutations the consequences of coronavirus species barrier jumping can be devastating and result in severe disease and mortality as exemplified by the sars outbreak the spike protein is the major determinant of coronaviruses tropism modification of the spike can alter cell and tissue tropism and in some cases in association with other viral and host factors may lead to change of virus pathogenicity zoonoses constitute a real risk for human health in the past coronaviruses have often demonstrated their propensity to infect new hosts highlighting the capacity for viral evolution and the need for surveillance great progress has been made in the understanding of spike protein functions however it remains impossible to predict the effect of mutations that a virus might acquire  comparative analyses of sar-cov2 genomes from different geographical locations and other coronavirus family genomes reveals unique features potentially consequential to host-virus interaction and pathogenesis rahila sardar deepshikha satish shweta birla dinesh gupta group leader  the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 we have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of sars-cov2 genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in sars-cov and other related coronavirus family genomes conferring unique infection facilitation of transmission virulence and immunogenic features to the virus the phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the sars-cov2 genome which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein a930v 24351ct in the indian sars-cov2 absent in other strains studied here we have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability using computational approach to gain further insights into host responses to viral infection we predict that antiviral host-mirnas may be controlling the viral pathogenesis our analysis reveals nine host mirnas which can potentially target sars-cov2 genes interestingly the nine mirnas do not have targets in sars and mers genomes also hsa-mir-27b is the only unique mirna which has a target gene in the indian sars-cov2 genome we also predicted immune epitopes in the genomes  the first case of covid-19 patient was reported in december 2019 at wuhan china and then it has spread worldwide to become a pandemic with maximum death cases in italy though initiallythe maximum mortality was reported from china 1 according to a who report as on 18 th march 2020 there were confirmed 209 839 covid-19 cases and 8778 cases of deaths that includes cases which were locally transmitted or imported 2  there are published reports which suggests that sars-cov2 shares highest similarity with bat sars-cov scientists across the globe are trying to elucidate the genome characteristics using phylogenetic structural and mutational analysis recent paper identified specific mutations in receptor binding domain rbd domain of spike protein which is most variable part in coronavirus genome 3  there are more than 400 sars-cov2 assembled genomes available at ncbi database sequence analysis of the genomes can give us plethora of information which can of use for drug development and vaccine development research attempts in the current work we collected sars-cov2 genomes from different geographical origins mainly from india italy usa nepal and wuhan to identify notable genomic features of sars-cov2 by integrated analysis these analyses include identification of notable mutational signatures host antiviral-mirna identification and epitope prediction as a host defense mechanism a repertoire of host mirnas also target invading viruses we followed the parameters used in various anti-viral mirna databases to predict host anti-viral mirnas against sars-cov2 our analysis shows unique host-mirnas targeting sars-cov2 virus genes respectively were retrieved from ncbi genome database sars-cov2 genomes from india italy usa nepal along with sars-cov and mers were used as query genomes to compare with wuhan sars-cov2 genome genes and protein sequences of sars-cov2 were retrieved from vipr database4 all assembled query genomes in fasta format were analyzed using genome  to understand the variation in genomes from various geographical areas used in the study we performed a phylogenetic analysis neighbor joining method with bootstrap value of 1000 replicates was used for the construction of consensus tree using mega software6 1017 version cello2go 7server was used to infer biological function for each protein of sars-cov2 genome with their localization prediction the mutations reported in literature 3were catalogued and evaluated for pathogenicity we used mutpred8server to identify disease associated amino acid substitution from neutral substitution with a p-value of 005 in order to assess the impact of snps on protein stability we used two machine learning based prediction methods the first method i-mutant server9 was used to predict stability of the protein sequences at ph 70 and temperature 25c the second prediction method is mupro10 server the predictions with the former method helps in getting a consensus prediction to predict host mirnas targeting the virus we collected a list of experimentally verified antiviral mirnas with their targets from virmirna database 11  only these host mirnas were processed for downstream analysis figure 1  to identify potential host microrna target sites in the virus genome sequences we have used miranda 33 a version 12 13 software with an energy threshold of -20 kcalmol we also used psrnatarget server to compare the predicted targets by the two methods 14  all the genes and protein sequences for sars-cov2 were retrieved from vipr database to identify ctl and b-cell epitopes we have used ctlpred15 abcpred16 servers with default parameters chemopred 17 and vaxijen server 18 were used to predict chemokines and protective probable antigen respectively  figure 1c  assembled sars-cov2 genomes sequences in fasta format from india usa china italy and nepal used for coronavirus typing tool analysis using the tool we were able to locate query sars-cov genomes with known sars-cov2 to obtain a cladogram for evolutionary analysis as shown in figure  several mutations are revealed when sar-cov2 and sars-cov spike glycoproteins are compared six frameshift mutations and 1 insertion in the genome that corresponds to s13q14inssdld 2160121602insagtgaccttgac  table s1  was also revealed we also observed that there are several mutations located in the regions associated with high immune response table s2 from snps analysis we observed that all the mutations might bring about decrease in stability without changing their properties ie hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity or vice versa l455y mutation predicted to altered ordered interface disordered interface stability transmembrane protein and gain of gpi-anchor amidation at n450 position table 2  it is known and also confirmed by gene ontology analysis that the protein is involved in pathogenesis membrane organization reproduction symbiosis encompassing mutualism through parasitism and locomotion psrnatarget analysis based on the complementary matching between the srna sequence and target mrna sequence with predefined scoring schema identified 6 mirnas out of the 9 identified mirnas to target sars-cov2 genes the 6 mirnasare predicted to act on the viral genomes by cleaving their target sites table   4  intriguingly our analysis s figure 2  revealed that there is only a single host mirna  we have used bioinformatics tools to investigate sars-cov2 sequences from different geographical locations the phylogenetic analysis of the genomes the nucleotide sequence diversity analysis of the genomes the predicted antiviral host mirnas specific to the genomes and the prediction of immune active sequences in the genomes have yielded some interesting facts including unique features for the phylogenetic analysis we compared the sequences of 6 sars-cov2 isolates from different countries namely wuhan india italy usa and nepal along with other corona virus species  figure 1  as reported earlier too 19 20  the virus from wuhan showed higher similarity with sars-cov there was no phylogenetic segregation of the genomes based on geographic origin whether from the same continent or a neighboring country figure 1  but ambiguously showing varied clustering like italy and nepal clustered together followed by india and usa this reiterates the findings indicating the massive exchange and importation of the carriers between the epicenter wuhan and these countries however a detail analysis complemented with more sequences and patient met data will give further evolutionary insights regarding the fast spreading pandemic the phylogenetics heterogeneity between different strains is explored by genome variation profiling to find alterations in genetic information during the course of evolution outbreak and clinical spectrum caused by the different strains in case of sars-cov2 and sars-cov too few clinical characteristics differentiate them among themselves and with other seasonal influenza infections as well as reported recently 21  interestingly in the present analysis in comparison to sars-cov we observed at least one of the variations like indels deletions misaligned and frameshift in all the sars-cov2 proteins except orf6 orf10 and orf14 table s1  the 22  going well with the expectations from a rapidly transmitting pandemic virus in our analysis we observed various mutations located in the regions associated with immune response table s2  these mutations may have significant impact on the antigenic and immunogenic changes responsible for differences in the severity of the outbreak in different geographical regions to gain further insights we compared the genetic mutation spectrum identified in the four countries namely usa italy india and nepal surprisingly the mutation spectrums were different among these countries  2 combined with other factors-a speculation which maybe verified with more evidences from this analysis we also speculate that the presence of country specific mutation spectrum may also be able to explain the current scenario in these countries like severity of illness containment of the outbreak the extent and timing of exposures to a symptomatic carrier etc non-structural proteins have their specific roles in replication and transcription 23  previous studies on sars-cov revealed nsp15 as a potential candidate for the therapeutic target 24  it is noteworthy to mention that in the present study various mutations have been identified in all the non-structural proteins suggesting them to be an important and potential player in proposing therapeutic targets and should be explored experimentally many studies have reported that mirnas not only act as the signature of tissue expression and function but also as potential biomarkers playing important role in regulating disease pathophysiology 25  in viral infections host antiviral mirnas play a crucial role in the regulation of immune response to virus infection depending upon the viral agent many known human mirnas appear to be able to target viral genes and their functions like interfering with replication translation and expression in the present study we tried to predict the antiviral host-mirnas specific for 26  also there are studies on the regulatory role of mirna hsa-mir-27b-3p described in ace2 signaling 27  the results of the present study suggest a strong correlation between mirna hsa-mir-27b-3p and ace2 which needs to be confirmed experimentally in sars-cov2 cases further we tried to compare the mirnas in the genomes and observed some striking findings we observed that out of all the mirnas hsa-mir-27b is the only unique based on our analysis we speculate an important regulatory role of mir-27b in sars-cov2 infection the contradictory treatment outcomes may be due to the presence of the mir-27b target in the indian genome specifically it probably indicates that the specific genetic and mirna spectrum should be considered as the basis of the treatment management the findings in the study have revealed unique features of the sars-cov2 genomes which may be explored further for example one may analyse the link between severity of diseases to each of the variants expression of the predicted host antiviral mirnas can be checked in the patients the predicted epitopes may be explored for their immunogenicity difference in treatment outcomes may also be correlated with genome variations lastly the potential of the unique segments of the virus proteins and the unique host mirnas may be explored in development of novel antiviral therapies  an integrated in silico immuno-genetic analytical platform provides insights into covid-19 serological and vaccine targets daniel ward matthew higgins jody phelan e martin hibberd l susana campino taane clark g prof clark taane  the covid-19 pandemic is causing a major global health and socio-economic burden instigating the mobilisation of resources into the development of control tools such as diagnostics and vaccines the poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study this requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for sars-cov-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity we have developed an online tool for sars-cov-2 research which combines an extensive epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis with an updated variant database 55944 nonsynonymous mutations based on 16087 whole genome sequences and an analysis of human coronavirus homology to demonstrate its utility we present an integrated analysis of the sars-cov-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins which are candidate vaccine and serological diagnostic targets results our analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a suboptimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms whilst a further analysis suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic assays the tool can be accessed online httpgenomicslshtmacukimmuno and will serve as a useful tool for biological discovery in the fight against sars-cov-2 further it may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks including new human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts  3 background covid-19 the disease caused by the sars-cov-2 virus was first characterised in the city of wuhan hubei and has now spread to over 180 countries instigating the most recent who public health emergency of international concern with over four million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 280000 deaths the covid-19 pandemic has placed an unfounded burden on the worlds healthcare infrastructure and economies 1  the majority of infections are either asymptomatic or result in mild flu-like disease with severe cases of viral pneumonia affecting between 10 20 years and 184 80 years of diagnosed patients 2  its variable infection outcome mode of transmission and incubation period together have enhanced the ability of the pathogen to spread efficiently worldwide as a result there has been an urgent push for the development of diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines to aid control efforts current front-line diagnostic strategies apply a quantitative reverse transcription pcr rt-qpcr assay on patient nasopharyngeal swabs using primerprobe sets targeting the nsp10 rdrp nsp14 envelope and nucleocapsid genes tests endorsed by a number of agencies and health systems 3 4  patients hospitalised with severe respiratory disease who are rt-qpcr negative may be radiographically diagnosed chest x-ray or computerised tomography scan but in resource-poor and high infection rate settings these methods may prove unviable considering the inherent limitations in the sample collection process and transient viral load rna detection-based diagnostics may vary in their sensitivity the demand for serological diagnostics is high particularly because these tests are capable of detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies a biomarker indicative of infection even if the virus is no longer present this is essential to address crucial questions like how many people have been infected within a population including those who may have been asymptomatic and how long immunity can last 4 numerous lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests rdts and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa tests have been developed included an approved igmigg rdt which uses the nucleocapsid protein as a target for the detection of seroconverted individuals 5  other assays use the spike protein as an antigen with some using the receptor binding domain rbd as a target a region with a high level of diversity between alphacoronavirus species 6  unlike rna detection methods these platforms can identify convalescent patients which is an important functionality to inform outbreak control efforts long-term control strategy will involve vaccine roll-out there are more than 60 vaccines at different phases of development pre-clinical clinical evaluation and roll-out 7 8  these include vaccines based on a non-replicating adenovirus vector base ad5-ncov an lnpencapsulated mrna a spike dna plasmid 7 8  and those using lentiviral-modified dendriticcellantigen presenting cells dcapc these latter vaccine platforms utilise in vivo clustered apcs to present antigen to the host adaptive immune system the ad5-ncov vaccine uses an adenovirus vector to deliver recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein antigen to vaccinated individuals with a view to elicit a protective humoral immune response the discovery of efficacious vaccines along with sensitive and specific serological diagnostics are both dependant on the availability of up-to-date information on viral evolution and immuneinformatic analyses the identification of variable or conserved regions in the proteome of sars-cov-2 can inform the rational selection of reverse-design targets in both vaccinology and diagnostic fields as well as indicate immunologically relevant regions of interest for further studies to characterise sars-cov-2 immune responses whilst there is some limited and narrow biological data for sars-cov-2 in the public domain insights are most likely to come from its integration informatically here we present an online integrated immune-analytic resource for the visualisation and extraction of sars-cov-2 meta-analysis data within a circular framework 9  this platform utilises an automated pipeline for the formation of a whole genome sequence variant database for sars-cov-2 isolates worldwide as of may 10 2020 n16087 we have integrated this dataset with 5 a suite of b-cell epitope prediction platform meta analyses hla-i and hla-ii peptide prediction an epitope mapping analysis of available experimental in vitro confirmed epitope data from the immune epitope database iedb and a protein orthologue sequence analysis of six relevant coronavirus species sars mers oc43 hku1 nl63 and 229e with all data updated and annotated regularly with information from the uniprot database with this resource users can browse the sars-cov-2 proteome annotated with the above analyses and easily extract meta data to inform further experiments as a demonstration of the tools function we present an analysis of the sars-cov-2 spike nucleocapsid and orf3a proteins which are vaccine and serological targets sars-cov-2 nucleotide sequences were downloaded from ncbi httpswwwncbinlmnihgov and gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg as a part of an automated in-house pipeline sequences were aligned using mafft software v72 10 and trimmed to the beginning of the first reading frame orf1ab-nsp1 sequences with 20 missing were excluded from the dataset using data available from the ncbi covid-19 resource a modified annotation gff file was generated and open reading frames orfs for each respective viral protein were extracted taking in to account ribosomal slippage using bedtools getfasta function 11  each orf was translated using emboss transeq software 12 and the variants for each protein sequence were identified using an in-house script as a part of our analysis pipeline we generated consensus sequences for each sars-cov-2 protein from the nucleotide database using emboss cons cli tool 12  these canonical sequences were used as a reference for prediction specificity and epitope mapping analyses six epitope prediction software platforms were chosen for this analysis bepipred 13  aappred 14 drrep 15  abcpred 16  lbtope 17 and bcepreds 18  the scores for by-residue analyses were selected based on internal probability metrics of 08 and then collated for platforms that output predicted sequences we used a quality cut-off of 80 and mapped them to the amino acid sequence of each gene using a pragmatic approach the scores across the predictive platforms were then normalised minimum-maximum scaled and combined to provide a consensus score we chose to use the netmhcpan server for our hla-i peptide prediction analysis due to its high overall performance and its extensive hla-i allele database 19  we ran predictions for a total of the analysis generated 11 billion candidates after qc we selected a total of 736073 peptides based on strong binding affinity across the allele database for further analysis we selected strong binding affinity peptides based on the tools internal binding scoring metrics only strong binding alleles were selected for further analysis for each position with a ligand with high binding affinity we analysed the percentage representation of the respective hla-i type across the allele database for predicting hla-ii peptides we used the maria online tool 20  we pre-processed the sars-cov-2 canonical protein sequences using a 15 amino acid sliding window we made predictions for all available hla-ii alleles a 95 cut off was chosen for a positive hla-ii presentation all data for each 15-mer is displayed on the tool b-cell epitopes for coronavirus species were sourced from the immune epitope database iedb resource httpswwwiedborg using blastp 21 we mapped short amino acid epitope sequences onto the canonical sequence of sars-cov-2 proteins a blastp bitscore of 25 with a minimum length of 8 residues was selected as a quality cut-off for mapped epitopes the frequency of mapped epitopes was logged for each position in the protein and parsed for graphical representation reference proteomes for sars mers oc43 229e hku1 and nl63  and  coronavirus -cov species were sourced from uniprot database these sequences were processed into 10-mers using the pyfasta platform and mapped on to the canonical sequences of sars-cov-2 proteins using the aforementioned epitope mapping process homologous peptide sequences with a blast bitscore indicating 10 or more residues mapped to the target sequence were recorded and parsed for display on the graph we developed an online resource with an interactive plot that integrates sars-cov-2 genetic variation epitope prediction and mapping with other coronavirus homology as well as a table for candidate proteome analysis this tool is available online from genomicslshtmacukimmuno see s1 figure for screenshots the biocircosjs library 9 was used to generate the interactive plot and datatablesnet libraries for the table the underlying browser software and in-house pipelines for data analysis are available httpsgithubcomdan-ward-biocovid-immunoanalytics analysis of 16087 sars-cov-2 sequences identified 55944 non-synonymous mutations across 4979 sites in protein coding regions the most frequent mutations were the spike protein d614g 635 and nsp12-l314p 632  table 1  nsp12-l314p is used to genotype the putative s and l strains of sars-cov-2 which have now been clustered into further groups 22  spike d614g lies 73 residues downstream from the spike rbd a region of interest as it is a major target of protective humoral responses and bears immunodominant epitopes that play a possible role in antibody dependant enhancement 23 24 25  other high frequency mutations occur on the nucleocapsid gene r203k 188 g204r 188 which has been the target antigen for several serological rdts currently in use 8 and in production we have identified 229 non-synonymous variant sites across the nucleocapsid gene with mutations occurring 8594 times in this dataset using the sars-cov-2 immuno-analytics platform we can further query these polymorphic regions for immunological relevance the 20 residues surrounding the spike mutation d614g figure 1  have a high epitope prediction meta-score 34 increase on the global median with 204 iedb epitope positions mapping to the surrounding residues suggesting this region is of high interest and may elicit a strong immune response on top of the high level of sars-cov sequence homology reported we have identified multiple clusters in the s2 domain of the spike protein with homology to mers oc43 229e hku1 and nl63 human coronaviruses which may result in a cross-reactive antibody response in immune sera human coronavirus sequence homology is greatly reduced in the s1 domain with only two small 10-residue pockets of oc43 and hku1 identity see figure 1  we observed a 17 increase over the median epitope meta-score in the receptor-binding motif aa437-508 a region implicated in ace2 recognition hla-ii peptide binding prediction yielded a region within the rbd s316-330 with high hla-ii ligand probability 06 as well as strong b-cell epitope prediction scores 28 above the global median meta data obtained from the uniprot database reveals 3 clusters of glycosylated residues a characteristic that should be considered when choosing expression systems for producing proteinpeptides based on these regions looking at the metadata associated with the two high frequency non-synonymous nucleocapsid protein mutations r203k and g204r there is a total of 38 variant sites 30 residues either side of these positions with mutations occurring 1271 times in the dataset not including r203k and g204r the average epitope meta-score for these variant sites is 30 above the global median prediction score with the two aforementioned high frequency mutant residues scoring 35 above the global median epitope predictive score the sequence homology analysis of the nucleocapsid protein revealed a high level of shared identity between sars-cov 90 and mers-cov 45 on a per-residue basis the k-mer mapping technique we have employed to identify homologous regions of 10 residues in proteins allows us to identify pockets of identity between orthologs -sufficiently long -to serve as hla-bound peptides something that is challenging using only pairwise multiple sequence alignments applying this analysis to the nucleocapsid protein reveals two clusters of shared human coronavirus orthologue identity figure 1  with an increased iedb epitope mapping frequency high polymorphism frequency and epitope meta-scores 23 above the global median indicative of potential immunogenicity the first area of interest is a 35-residue region within the nucleocapsid 102-137 which exhibits nl63 sars oc43 229e mers and hku1 human coronavirus homology within this region we observed an increase in mapped iedb epitopes from other coronavirus species providing in vitro confirmation that these are indeed cross-reactive epitopes the second region 167-206 contains the r203k and g204r mutations along with a cluster of high frequency variants we detected homology with hku1 nl63 and mers human coronavirus species along with a high frequency of mapped iedb epitopes and a 34 increase on the median epitope prediction meta-score we have incorporated an hla-i peptide prediction analysis into the tool to aid in the scrutiny and development of vaccine candidates cd8  effector immunity has been reported to play a central role 26 27 29  we analysed these regions for their performance as hla-i ligands in-silico and found that all of the regions of interest had a high binding affinity score associated with that position moreover these peptides were widely represented in the predictions made across the 2915 hla-a -b and -c alleles used in this analysis figure 2  with an average allele coverage across all peptides of 21 18 and 34 in hla-a -b and -c respectively these findings imply that these peptides as hla-i ligands may indeed also serve to initiate a protective cellular response in sars-cov-2 infections across a significant proportion of the hla-i population worldwide we have identified another region of interest that scores highly in the hla-i peptide binding analysis s690-700 has a high frequency of strongly binding peptides with significant representation across hla-i alleles 40 23 and 60 for hla-a -b and -c respectively furthermore we have observed no mutations present in this region based on our sars-cov-2 variant analysis implying this peptide appears to remain conserved making it a prime candidate for further study protein 3a orf3a has been reported to play a role in host immune modulation by decreasing interferon alpha-receptor expression in sars-cov infected cells and activating the nlrp3 inflammasome 30 31 a response that may boost inflammation mediated pathology orf3a has been a target for sars-cov vaccinology studies with reports of it eliciting potentially protective responses in both protein and dna forms 32 28  these immunogenic properties appear conserved in the sars-cov-2 orthologue with consistently strong antibody responses reported in covid-19 patients 33  looking across the sars-cov-2 proteome of the 50 residues with the highest b-cell epitope prediction meta-score orf3a occupies 16 despite only constituting 25 percent of the total sars-cov-2 protein sequence moreover there are numerous high affinity hla-ii epitopes which may serve to elicit strong antibody responses although protein orf3a shares a high level of identity with its sars-cov orthologue we detected no amino acid sequence homology with oc43 nl63 hku1 and 229e human coronavirus species our analysis of the 16087 sar-cov-2 whole genome sequences detected 163 variant sites within orf3a although only 17 sites have an alternative allele frequency greater than 01 with non-synonymous mutations occurring in 7042 samples across the dataset a comparable level of polymorphism relative to the size of the gene compared to the nucleocapsid protein the variant sites identified in the orf3a gene have a mean epitope predictive meta-score of 23 which is equal to the median global indicating that these sites may not form a part of a b-cell epitope comparing the predictive meta-scores of the nucleocapsid protein variant sites we observed an increase of 26 over the global median indicating that nucleocapsid protein non-synonymous mutations may impact epitope variability more than those found in orf3a cd8  effector responses to protein 3a have been characterised in sars-cov patients and appear to play a significant role in immunity 27 34 35  notably alongside two within the spike protein a peptide in orf3a orf3a36-50 has been found to form a part of the public conserved tcell epitope repertoire across sars-cov patients 35  this region scores highly in the hla-ii predictions with numerous hla-a and hla-b high affinity peptides with 19 41 and 48 coverage across the hla-a b and c database respectively and is relatively conserved with few low frequency non-synonymous mutations mutant allele frequency maximum of 00017 n28 we have developed an immune-analytical tool that combines in silico prediction data with in vitro epitope mapping sars-cov-2 genome variation and a k-mer-based human coronavirus sequence homology with curated functional annotation data the integration and co-visualisation of these data support the rational selection of diagnostic vaccine targets with reverse-immunology and highlight regions for further immunological studies using the tool we focused our analysis on three proteins that are of relevance to current sars-cov-2 research highlighting important features that will inform decisions in producing targets understanding the magnitude of transmission and patterns of infection will lead to insights for postisolation strategies there has been a rush to deploy serological rdts for the detection of sars-cov-2 iggigm antibody responses there are anecdotal accounts that some tests using spike and nucleocapsid antigens have been found to be insufficiently accurate and have therefore not yet been deployed other assays have been based solely on the nucleocapsid protein and our analysis reveal that in its native form this protein may prove a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms 5  it possesses the greatest number of residues across all sars-cov-2 genes with high-frequency non-synonymous mutations the majority of which have a high predictive epitope and iedb epitope mapping scores when compared to variant positions of other genes this implies that there may be an inherent variability in dominant antibody responses to different nucleocapsid protein isoforms which may work to confound testing we have located three regions of homology with other highly prevalent human coronavirus species which could serve as nonspecific sars-cov-2 epitopes if used in serological assays moreover we have emphasised the high level of sars-cov identity across the sars-cov-2 proteome except in orf8 and orf10 which may have implications for diagnostic deployment in countries that have had outbreaks involving sars-cov the spike protein has remained a focus of both vaccine and diagnostic research its functional role in viral entry imparts this antigen with immunodominant and neutralising antibody responses 23 36  this role is confirmed in our analyses with several clusters of high epitope meta-scores in functional regions and iedb epitope mapping counts the s1 domain in particular has been the focus of a number of studies looking for specific antigens not least because of its apparent lack of sequence homology with other human coronavirus species when compared to regions in the s2 domain and its apparent immunogenicity 6 33 36 37  however as vaccination programmes begin most of which will target the spike protein in one way or another it will become challenging to differentiate vaccination responses from those elicited by sars-cov-2 infection there may then be a requirement for alternative viable targets for serological screening using the sars-cov-2 immuno-analytics platform we were able to identify shortcomings in current targets for diagnostics and suggest orf3a as another target for further study this protein has proven in vitro immunogenicity in covid-19 patients as well as an array of supportive results from analyses performed here the database underpinning the online tool will be updated regularly with all iedb epitopes mutations and functional annotations as they become available importantly this openaccess platform and tool enables the acquisition of all of the aforementioned data associated with the sars-cov-2 proteome assisting further important research on covid-19 control tools the sars-cov-2 immunoanalytics platform enables the straightforward visualisation of omic data to inform research in vaccine diagnostic and immunology research by integrating genomic and proteomic analyses with in-silico epitope predictions we have highlighted important advantages and shortcomings of two proteins at the foci of covid-19 research spike and nucleocapsid while suggesting another candidate for further study orf3a both spike and nucleocapsid proteins have regions of high identity shared with other endemic h-cov species moreover several high frequency mutations found in our dataset lie within putative t and b-cell epitopes something that should be taken into consideration when designing vaccines and diagnostics the sequencing data analysed during the current study are
