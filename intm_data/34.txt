fractional calculus can provide a promising tool in modeling biological phenomena as reviewed recently by lonescu et al 1 for example fractional-derivative equation fde models have been applied to capture complex dynamics in biological tissues 2 tumor growth 3 dna sequencing 4 drug uptake 5 and salmonella bacterial infection in animal herds 6 most recently the fde models have been applied to model the pine wilt disease 7 the human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv disease 8 the harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass 9 human liver using caputo-fabrizio fractional derivative 10 11 and tumor-immune surveillance 12 motivated by these successful applications this study tests whether the fdes can be applied to model the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of coronavirus an emerging and critical research area that has not been focused by the fractional calculus community beforethe novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak a respiratory illness that started first detected in late december 2019 is a pandemic infecting 336000 people in more than 140 countries with the average fatality rate of 44 globally data up to 3222020 13 the covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge to address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts it is critical to model the covid-19 outbreak mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the covid-19 and therefore testing the applicability of such fde models under this new global pandemic is the primary objective motivating this studythis study aims to model the covid-19 evolution dynamics ie transmission infection recovery and death evolution for representative countries with apparent coronavirus cases including china the united states us italy japan and south korea using mathematical models most specifically the fde models described previously it should be noted that the covid-19 spread in these countries experienced different starting initiation and detection times an important fact to consider when applying these models for example china had passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak finally reaching a milestone with no new local infections on 3192020 79 days from the onset 12312019 in wuhan china while the us coronavirus cases soared past 10000 on the same day this study will apply the core characteristics of the covid-19 outbreak obtained in china to estimate the covd-19 spread in the us as well as other countries where the number of affected people has not yet reached its number of peak casesin addition this new pandemic may last for a relatively longer time than expected 14 no vaccine against sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is currently available 15 indeed a vaccine for prevention and infection control may not be ready before march 2021 for the covid-19 considering a minimum of 45 weeks for trials and at least 1 year for safety evaluation and final deployment efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the covid-19 outbreak possible non-pharmaceutical scenarios such as isolation of cases and contact tracing can be evaluated using mathematical models 16 in order to identify the most efficient mitigation strategies going forward this is another major motivation and the secondary task of this study using the fde modelsto address the questions mentioned above this study is organized as follows section 2 proposes an updated seir model with an fde-based component for covid-19 where s e i and r stand for susceptible exposed infectious and recovered people respectively 17 this model is then applied to fit and predict the covid-19 spread in various provinces and major cities in china resulting in abundant datasets to derive the core characteristics of the covid-19 dynamics in evolution section 3 predicts the spread of covid-19 in the other countries using the knowledge that is gained from the china case study section 4 proposes a fully lagrangian approach with the time fde to model the spatiotemporal evolution of covid-19 and then applies it to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate the virus spread section 5 reports the main conclusions specifically the feasibility of fdes for capturing covid-19 evolution in the appendix the impacts of the non-singular kernel and fractional derivative type on model results are further discussed for readers particularly interested in these fractional calculus techniques the main contributions of this work therefore include 1 the first application of fdes in modeling the evolution of the covid-19 death toll 2 an updated seir model with a transient recovery rate to better capture the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic within china and for other countries and 3 a particle-tracking approach based on stochastic bimolecular reaction theory to evaluate the mitigation of the spread of the covid-19 outbreakthe classical seir model containing four populations s e i and r takes the form 291adsdtrpisn

2 is the rate for the healthy susceptible person to be transferred to an infected one from exposed persons note that covid-19 patients in the incubation period might be contagious too and r
2 is the number of healthy susceptible people that are contacted by exposed people daily now the infection rates can change with time and the infected persons are removed from the risk of infection via a time-dependent rate term of t if the recovered individuals can return to a susceptible status due to for example a loss of immunity then the partial differential equation pde 2d for the time rate of change of r requires one more sink term r where  is the rate of the recovered individuals returning to a susceptible statuswe replace the integer-order derivatives in the classical seir 1 by the fractional-order derivatives in 2 to capture the possible nonlocal impact such as the memory impact or any apparent delay in the covid-19 outbreak herein we use the death evolution 2e as an example hence the fde 2e containing the death probability of  while the other patients are cured is modified asdddt110tdtd which is the caputo fractional derivative 30 31 with order  0     1 note that all the other indexes

3 and 
4 in model 2 are in the same range of 0 1 the caputo fractional derivate was selected here because the initial condition for caputo derivative takes the same form as that for the integer-order pde particularly the caputo derivative allows the utilization of initial values of the integer order with known physical interpretations when the order 1 model 2e reduces to the classical integer-order pde for the death evolution the fractional pde 2e is used here for two reasons first the evolution of deaths and cures may be characterized by a random process due to the fact that the exact time for the recovered person to be initially infected is unknown ie the patient that died or was cured today may have been diagnosed yesterday or last week second some patients may not be treated in time after being infected making the death toll evolve with a time memory therefore we extend the classical mass-balance equation of death cases using the fde to characterize the random property and memory impact embedded in the temporal evolution of mortality the fractional pde 2e and its classical version will be compared below using real observed dataother complex seir models were also applied to model covid-19 spread such as the one proposed by tang et al 32 which has 12 ratesprobabilities and 8 groups of people in seir numerical results show that compared with the seir model 2 the complex model proposed by tang et al 32 with solutions shown by the dotted lines in fig 1
a accurately fits the observed data at the early stage but then overpredicts the spread of covid-19 observed after 2122020 the dynamics of transmission for covid-19 especially the recovery rate therefore changed over time in china likely due to the time-dependent conditions ie improvementsadjustments in medical care as mentioned above a dynamic time-local seir model therefore may be preferred for modeling covid-19 spread in chinain addition compared to the fde 2e the best-fit solution using the classical pde dddti for death evolution see the black dotted line in fig 1
a slightly overestimates the late-time growth of mortality the actual death toll in hubei province grew slower than that estimated by a constant rate model indicating that the memory impact may affect the late-time dynamics of death and can be better captured by the fde 2ethe best-fit solutions using model 2 fit the evolution of the infected and recovered populations well for the data recorded from hubei province and three large cities closely related such as in transportation or economic cooperation to wuhan china fig 1 the model was also shown to predict well the observed time series of covid-19 spread from 382020 to 3222020 for most places except for shanghai city fig 1
d this is likely due to the number of overseas covid-19 cases imported into shanghai whereby the number of cases were observed to increase rapidly after 332020 causing inconsistency in the affected population and failure of the model shanghai pudong international airport one of the two airports located in shanghai city is the eighth-busiest airport in the world and the busiest international gateway of mainland china when excluding the coronavirus cases imported from overseas model 2 predicts the covid-19 spread evolution data in shanghai fig 2
 therefore model 2 works well for various places in china that may not be experience a significant influx of imported cases as external sources can easily break the internal evolution especially the asymptotic status of covid-19 in chinathe resultant time-dependent recovery rate t is depicted in fig 3
 where the rate fitted by the latest observation data point within the fitting period ie 372020 remains stable in the following prediction period the best-fit recovery rate is the highest for shanghai except for the impulse of t for wenzhou as discussed below which is expected since shanghai has the best public health system of all of these cities contrarily hubei shows the lowest recovery rate likely due to its delayed response and the relatively limited public health capability at the beginning of the outbreak compared with shanghaiwenzhou exhibits an impulse in the infection and recovery dynamics of coronavirus fig 1
b different from that observed for the other places studied herein on february 27 2020 the number of wenzhous infected people suddenly declined combined with the sudden increase of the number of people cured this abrupt change can be effectively captured by the seir model 2 with an impulse in the recovery rate t this recovery impulse is most likely due to a new hospital the no 2 affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university recently built in this city in early february which significantly improved the public health system the first discharged cases of coronavirus from this hospital appeared in late february 2020 resulting in the sudden increase in the total recovery rate in addition a relatively large number of people working in wuhan returned to wenzhou in late january and it appears that the improved efficient screening process successfully identified the number of infected cases the new cases were 29000 from 1242020 to 1312020 in wenzhou with an average of 3600 new patients per day who were then immediately centralized for treatment it appears that this fast response helped to alleviate the spread of coronavirus in wenzhouthe best-fit parameters of model 2 are listed in table 1
 and the initial values for each group of people are listed in table 2
 we reveal three behaviors in model parameters first the best-fit s-shaped recovery rate t fig 3 can be described by the sigmoid function ta1ebtc where a b and c are factors showing that the recovery rate increases exponentially before reaching a stable condition this increase is likely due to the fact that healthcare facility capabilities improved with time with an accelerating rate before reaching their asymptote or maximum capacitysecond the rates and probabilities r r
2 p and p
2 affecting the covid-19 transmissioninfection evolution slightly change in space and remain stable for a given site table 1 the small spatial fluctuation of these rates may be due to the similar strategies implemented by local governments for intervening and mitigating covid-19 spread ie full lockdowns across the country the time-invariant transmissioninfection rates for a given site indicate that the spreading rate of covid-19 may not significantly change over a short period of time for a given area with consistent intervening policies enactedthird the model predictions show that it may take 47 14 25 and 11 days from 3142020 for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population for hubei province and the cities of wenzhou shenzhen and shanghai respectively notably since the best-fit t increases in time the prediction using a constant  may overestimate the long-term future infection cases and underestimate the future recovery trend for covid-19we also introduce an index c to quantify the infection severity of covid-19 at different places3cnimax where imax is the maximum number of cumulative infected people at the given site a smaller c represents a greater infection severity of coronavirus there is a power-law relationship between the regional population n and the maximum cumulated number of infected people imax fig 4
 this empirical formula may be used to approximate the largest cumulative number of infections which will be applied in the subsequent section for predicting the covid-19 evolution outside of china where the coronavirus infection has not yet reached its peak number of casesto decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread the uss main propagated mode up to 3222020 has been the use of social distancing actions the predicted covid-19 spread in the us is plotted in fig 5
 there is a high uncertainty in the prediction of covid-19 evolution within the us considering the recent dramatic fluctuations in the number of infected people and the delayed screening during the beginning stages of the outbreak thus we must make assumptions and can only estimate the future coronavirus evolution in the us under specific scenarios based on the index of infection severity c in the representative areas of china we predict the us covid-19 evolution dynamics under two scenarios as shown in fig 5
fig 5
a shows the possible spread of covid-19 in california us assuming that the coronavirus dynamics including the infectionrecovery rates and the infection severity are similar to those observed in hubei china the solid lines representing an optimistic scenario or can change quite differently the dashed lines representing a longer-term severe scenario the estimated total population of infection in california varies from 50000 to 200000 with the peak number of cases occurring around 20 to 50 days from 3222020
fig 5
b shows the possible spread of covid-19 in the us solid lines represent model solutions assuming that covid-19 spreads similarly to that as observed in hubei china while the dashed lines are model solutions that assume covid-19 spreads differently the results show that the estimated total infected population varies from 700000 to 3000000 with the peak number of cases occurring 2050 days and the covid-19 outbreak lasting for 50 days from 3222020 respectivelyto decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread italys mode is now similar to china lockdown of the full population the predicted covid-19 spread in italy is plotted in fig 6
a although italy has followed chinas mode of national isolation the number of infected people increased rapidly from 3142020 to 3192020 495 new cases per day to account for the delayed national quarantine compared with china we decrease the c index while also increasing the upper limit of the cumulative infection the covid-19 evolution prediction results show that there may be a turning point in the next two weeks when the current infected cases begin to decline we also separate the death toll from the number of recovered casessouth koreas mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is through fast detection and tracking of the disease south korea is using efficient mobile diagnoses tests and accurate tracing of infected cases to maintain a low death rate even with a large infected population the mobile method can test 20000 people per day the maximum capability on 3122020 and apps for cell phones andor credit cards can accurately track the routes of infected people with the help of local government without an invasion of privacy so that warnings can be immediately delivered to the general population to obviate the places with high risk the current infected population may have passed its peak number of cases around 3202020 and the prediction shows that the covid-19 outbreak may be well controlled in 35 days from 3222020 fig 6
bjapans mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is compatible with that of the us in addition to other changes such as enhanced educationoutreach and rapid treatment of the infected cases specific policies include social distancing which might be a key barrier to the spread of the novel coronavirus personal hygiene and quarantine of the infected cases the current data and modeling results fig 6
c show that japan has an efficient way so far to limit the maximum population infected and slow the spread of covid-19 while this outbreak may last for a whilethe random walk based stochastic model for covid-19 spread is analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction-based mechanismcondition 35 when a reactant a particle representing a susceptible individual a meets a reactant b particle representing an infectious person b a chemical reaction may occur if the collision energy is large enough to break the chemical bond meaning that the susceptible person a may be infected if satisfying additional criteria such as a and b are close enough and b touches hisher face after receiving coronavirus from a therefore the condition of a being infected is not deterministic but rather a random probability-controlled process this probability is related to various factors such as the duration that a and b are in contact the infectivity rate and the distance between the two people which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius r that controls the number of reactant pairs susceptible  infectious in a potential reaction infection 35 hence the core of the random walk stochastic model to simulate covid-19 spread is to define the interaction radius rthe analogous development and similarities between bimolecular reactions and the sir model can also be seen from their governing equations the time-dependent sir model takes the form 364adstdttstitn

scenario 1 no special constraints assuming a city with 10000 people and 4 initial coronavirus cases this scenario does not put any constraints for any population we assume that the population distributes in the city randomly at the beginning and then moves randomly the spread of covid-19 is then simulated using the stochastic model proposed in section 41
scenario 2 social distancing this scenario assumes that all people in the city maintain a social distance significantly decreasing the probability of infection
scenario 3 attempted quarantine this scenario creates a forced quarantine for infected individuals before the outbreak which is expected to be the most efficient way of quarantinein the stochastic model we assume that 10 days after being infected the person will be removed because of being cured or expired dead this is because the median disease incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 39 for simplicity purposes the interaction radius r 6 remains constant since the constant interaction radius was found to be able to efficiently capture the temporal variation of effective reaction rates in mixing controlled reaction experiments or simulations 35 37 the initial number of a and b particles is 10000 and 4 respectively the lagrangian solutions of the covid-19 outbreak for the three scenarios are depicted in fig 7
modeling results for scenarios 1 2 and 3 show a peak in the curve of newly infected people at time t28 65 and 32 respectively demonstrating that the virus spreads the fastest for the scenario without mitigation constraints ie scenario 1 where the number of the total infected people or cases increases by one order of magnitude every 10 days in the rising limb as expected however the value for this peak scenario 1 198 people is lower than that for scenario 3 267 people although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 9336 is slightly larger than scenario 3 9322 this may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1 which causes a lower and relatively flatter covid-19 evolution peak compared to that of scenario 3 scenario 2 has the lowest peak value 121 people and the most-delayed peak in the curve for new cases and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two scenarios indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of covid-19 threat it is also noteworthy that the overall trend of the solution simulation of scenario 1 initial surge without special constraints fig 7
a is similar to that for italy which had a delayed response to the covid-19 outbreak initially fig 6
a and scenario 3 solution a lower peak value and a longer duration due to social distancing fig 7
b is similar to that observed in japan where social distancing actions have been implemented fig 6
cthe simulated particle plumes plotted in fig 8
reveal the subtle discrepancy between the three mitigation scenarios scenario 1 assumes that four initial cases were initially located on the right side of the city while the whole population 10000 susceptible persons was distributed randomly in the 1  1 domain fig 8
a the trajectory of each person is assumed to follow two-dimensional brownian motion with retention described by eq 7 to capture the random vector for each displacement and the random waiting time between two consecutive motions described by the time fractional derivative term in eq 7 the virus moved quickly from east to west figs 8
b and 8
c spreading over the entire city before all the infected people were cured or expired dead at time t69 fig 8
d a total of 664 susceptible people 66 of the total population distributed randomly around the city were never infected
scenario 2 assumes that social distancing can reduce the infection probability which can be characterized by a smaller reaction rate or a smaller interaction radius in our lagrangian approach the virus was spreading at a much lower rate from west to east than that in scenario 1 figs 8
e8g reaching a stable condition ie  of cases neither increasing or decreasing at a later time t125 and leaving more susceptible people unaffected 2734 total which is 273 of the population therefore social distancing is effective in limiting the spread of coronavirus among people note however this scenario assumes that every person in this city strictly maintains social distancing otherwise a surge of infections may occur the same way as that shown in scenario 1
scenario 3 assumes self-quarantine notably not all of the infected people can be effectively quarantined due to the following 1 people can be infected without coronavirus symptoms 2 people in the incubation period can transmit the infection and 3 limited health care facilities and capabilities for the large influx of patients for example according to imai et al 40 many infected people could not be appropriately screened initially in wuhan city china under this condition we assume that 50 of people infected and diagnosed are immediately quarantined while the remaining infected people fig 8
i can still cause the spread of coronavirus figs 8
j8l self-quarantine therefore may not be as effective as maintained social distancingfractional calculus provides a useful tool to modeling complex dynamics in biology and this study extended the fde for modeling the coronavirus outbreak the covid-19 is a pandemic radically impacting our lives by altering our daily patterns and interactions in an unprecedented way and rate a time-dependent seir model with built-in fde components motivated by the coronavirus milestone of recording zero new local infections in china on 3192020 was applied to capture the covid-19 evolution observed over the last three months in china a stochastic model built upon the time fde for random resting times of people was also proposed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical mitigation options three main conclusions are presented by this studyfirst different properties in the covid-19 spreading in china data up to 3222020 exhibited different kinetics and the death evolution can be captured by the time fde model fitting showed that the recovery rate of covid-19 increases with time due to various human factors the fast-increasing recovery rate caused the rapid decline of the current infected population curve removing the possible memory impact and any delayed processes which does not require a time-nonlocal model such as the time fde contrarily the evolution of deaths in china italy south korea and japan can be captured well by the time fde likely due to the time memory in the death toll it is also noteworthy that the time fde version of the seir model might be needed if the late-time recovery rate declines due to the change of coronavirus properties affected by the change of climate public policy andor possible evolution of the virus itself and the contiguous mannerratesecond the updated seir model provided predictions although with high uncertainty for covid-19 evolution within china and for other countries for example the improved seir model showed that if the infection and recovery rates remain stable the number of cumulative infections is likely to decline to 1 of the total infected population within one month from 3222020 in china the overseas imported cases however may break the internal asymptotic status and significantly postpone the ending time of covid-19 in china predictions using the validated seir model also showed different evolution dynamics of covid-19 within populations of the united states italy japan and south korea for example it may take at least 23 months for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population in the us requiring more efficient mitigation strategies while south korea may control the covid-19 spread in a relatively shorter period however these predictions contain high uncertainty due to uncertainty in the maximum infected population and changes of transmissioninfection and recovery rates among different countriesthird a stochastic model based on the lagrangian scheme for the time fdes analogous to a mixing-limited reaction mechanism model showed that self-quarantine may not be as effective as strict social distancing since not all the infected people can be diagnosed and immediately quarantined while strict social distancing can apparently slow covid-19 spread the pandemic may last longer this is another case that fractional calculus may be used to explore covid-19 outbreak

abd-elmaksoud et al 2014 alexyuk et al 2017 bibby et al 2011 bibby and peccia 2013 blanco et al 2019 casanova et al 2009 collomb et al 1986 gundy et al 2019 wang et al 2005a wang et al 2005b wang et al 2005c ye et al 2016four papers dealing with the persistence or survival of cov in waters were retrieved table 2 the articles were related to seeding experiments in which sars-cov human cov 229e or surrogate animal cov tgev fipv or murine hepatitis virus mhv were used to spike different water types wang et al 2005a casanova et al 2009 gundy et al 2009 ye et al 2016wang and coworkers studied the persistence of sars-cov in water hospital wastewater domestic sewage and dechlorinated tap water and in feces and urine wang et al 2005a in the study the effect of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide in inactivating sars-cov escherichia coli and the enterobacteria phage f2 spiked in wastewater was evaluatedsars-cov was detected in hospital wastewater domestic sewage and tap water for 2 days at 20 c and up to 14 days at 4 c thus demonstrating temperature strongly influences viral persistence indeed it has been universally demonstrated that higher temperatures are associated with rapid inactivation of enteric viruses and temperature is recognised as the most influential factor for viral survival in water due to increased denaturation of proteins and activity of extracellular enzymes pinon and vialette 2018wang and coworkers wang et al 2005a highlighted that sars-cov persists 3 days in stools and 17 days in urine stored at 20 c on the other hand at a lower temperature 4 c they persist for 17 days the same study showed that chlorine was more effective than chlorine dioxide in inactivating e coli f2 phage and sars-cov and a free residual chlorine of 05 mgl from chlorine or 219 mgl from chlorine dioxide in wastewater ensured complete inactivation of sars-cov in the experimental conditions of the study sars-cov was inactivated completely in presence of 10 mgl chlorine and a minimum contact time of 10 min or in 1 min using 20 mgl chlorine under the same conditions e coli and f2 phage were not inactivated effectively this findings are of specific relevance since according to the 4th edition of the world health organizations guidelines for drinking-water quality viruses are generally more resistant to free chlorine than bacteria specifically moderate resistance for viruses and low for the vast majority of bacteria who 2017 the viruses considered of concern for water in who guidelines however are principally enteric viruses familes adenoviridae astroviridae caliciviridae hepeviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae which are as previously reported non-enveloped viruses it is well known that these viruses are more resistant to environmental conditions water treatments and disinfectants than enveloped viruses like coronavirus as lysis of the viral envelope leads to the loss of functional receptors required for infection of susceptible cells wigginton et al 2015 according to the results of wang 2005a sars-cov resistance to chlorine is lower than for bacteria it follows that the current water disinfection practices drinking water wastewater water from swimming pool effective against non-enveloped viruses and bacteria are expected to be effective also towards enveloped viruses such as coronavirusesthe study of casanova et al 2009 evaluated the survival of two surrogate coronaviruses tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus a porcine coronavirus and mhv murine hepatitis virus in reagent-grade water lake water and settled human sewage two temperatures were evaluated over 6 weeks room temperature 2325 c and 4 c in general in all the water tested the titer of infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25 c than at 4 c confirming that temperature is an important factor affecting viral survival in water at 25 c the time required for a 999 reduction t999 in reagent-grade water was 33 days and 26 days for tgev and mhv respectively while in pasteurized settled sewage it was 14 days and 10 days respectively on the other hand no significant decrease of tgev and mhv was reported in reagent-grade water at 4 c after 49 days and limited reduction was obtained at the same temperature in lake water after 14 days based on these results the authors suggest that contaminated water may be a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated however it is important to underline that the surrogate animal coronaviruses used in this study are responsible for gastrointestinal or hepatic diseases in animals and may therefore display a different resistance behaviour compared to respiratory human coronaviruses this could explain the greater resistance and longer survival displayed by cov in this work compared to the study of wang and colleagues 2005a moreover the use of different cell lines and growth media in these persistence studies might have contribute to measurement uncertainty
gundy et al 2019 investigated the survival of a human coronavirus hcov-229e and of an animal coronavirus fipv feline infectious peritonitis virus in tap water filtered and non-filtered and wastewater primary and activated sludge effluents comparing results with those of poliovirus-1 pv-1 sabin attenuated strain lsc-2ab in wastewater the tested cov died off quite rapidly with a t999 of 277354 days at 23 c significantly the pv-1 lasted 2 to 3 times longer than cov did requiring 109 days for a comparable reduction in primary wastewater and 57 days in secondary effluents in tap water cov reduction was slower than in wastewaters at 23 c the t999 was 121125 days for hcov-229e and fipv while at 4 c the same reduction was predicted by modelling to be achivable over 100 days these yields highlight once again that virus survival decreases with increasing temperature similarly to the results obtained on wastewater pv-1 survived six times longer than cov in both filtered and unfiltered tap water confirming the observation that non-enveloped viruses display higher resistance in water enviroments compared to enveloped viruses another important finding of the study was that cov inactivation was faster in filtered tap water than unfiltered tap water suggesting that suspended solids in water can provide protection for viruses adsorbed to these particlesfinally a more recent study ye et al 2016 investigated the survival and partitioning of two enveloped viruses mhv and pseudomonas phage 6 and of two non-enveloped viruses bacteriophages ms2 and t3 in untreated municipal wastewater unpasteurized and pasteurized wastewater were spiked with the viral stocks and were then incubated at 25 c or 10 c to mimic typical summer and winter wastewater temperatures inactivation proceeded faster for the enveloped viruses in unpasteurized wastewaters at 25 c the time to reach a 90 reduction t90 was 13 h for mhv and 7 h phage 6 compared to a predicted value of 121 h for the non-enveloped phage ms2 at 10 c the inactivation kinetics of both mhv and 6 were once again significantly slower than at environmental temperatures with a t90 of 2836 h in pasteurized wastewater both mhv and phage 6 lost infectivity at a significantly slower rate compared to unpasteurized wastewater t90 of 19 h for mhv and 53 h for phage 6 at 25 c possibly due to the reduction of bacterial extracellular enzyme activity and the absence of protozoan and metazoan predation in pasteurized samples indeed it was demonstrated that the presence of an indigenous microbial population has a negative impact on virus survival pinon and vialette 2018 rzezutka and cook 2004 finally in the same study ye et al reported that up to 26 of the enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater that means that a reduction of enveloped viruses in wastewaters is provided by solid settlingtwo reports specifically addressing detection in water environments of cov of interest for human health and three metagenomicvirome studies were retrieved through literature search table 3sewage discharges from two hospitals in beijing china hosting sars patients during the 2003 outbreak were analyzed with the aim to investigate whether sewage may be a possible route of transmission for sars-cov wang et al 2005b both cell culture and rt-pcr were utilized to ascertain viability and detect the virus in sewage while viral genome was repeatedly detected in hospital sewage before disinfection 1010 wastewater samples and in some cases after disinfection 310 samples infectious sars-cov was never detected in the tested samples possible explanation of authors includes viral inactivation by disinfectants high concentration of disinfectants were used after a patient had bowel movements low viral concentration or loss of infectivity by unknown factors during the concentration processin the second study specifically addressing cov detection in water blanco et al 2019 investigated the occurrence of these viruses in surface waters of wadi hanifa riyadh using a broad-range rt-pcr for the detection of alpha- and betacoronavirus of the 21 tested samples only one sample was positive for cov upon sequence analysis the positive sample was found to be closely related to a novel rodentshrew-specific clade within lineage a of alphacoronavirus reported in asia and europethree metagenomic studies have detected cov in water matrices two focused on class b biosolids from wastewater treatment facility bibby et al 2011 bibby peccia 2013 and one on different type of water river lake reservoir alexyuk et al 2017 the study of bibby and coworkers identified a large variety of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in biosolids including coronavirus herpesvirus torque teno virus and parechovirus interestingly all these groups of viruses were highly represented in compared to adenovirus which have been for long time considered the most abundant viral genus in biosolids bibby et al 2011 in detail 10 cov sequences were identified nine of which related to hcov-229e and one to hcov-hku1two years later another paper from the same authors described the diversity of viruses in sewage sludge samples influents and effluents with comparable results emerging viruses such as coronavirus klassevirus and cosavirus were detected in abundance in the sample bibby peccia 2013 coronaviruses were detected in 83 of samples and coronavirus hku1 was the second most prevalent rna virus interestingly coronavirus showed a higher relative abundance in influent samples compared to effluent onesfinally alexyuk et al 2017 studied the viromes sampled in surface water river lake and water reservoir while the majority of the sequences were related to autochthonous viruses typical for aquatic ecosystems allochthonous viruses such families as coronaviridae reoviridae and herpesviridae were also detected suggesting anthropogenic pollution of the three selected water environments in detail coronaviridae were detected in all of the three environments ranging from 0002 to 0009 of the total sequences depending on sampleto complete the picture on the occurrence of coronavirus in water environments after the initial submission of this scoping review while the paper was under review novel papers some of which published as preprint have demonstrated the occurrence of sars-cov-2 in municipal wastewaters worldwide and specifically in the netherlands medema et al 2020 in massachusetts wu et al 2020 in australia ahmed et al 2020 france wurtzer et al 2020 and italy la rosa et al 2020 submittedfive studies table 4 investigated concentration methods for cov in waters and the associated recovery efficiencythe first study investigating cov recovery from waters was published more than 30 years ago collomb et al 1986 using for the spiking experiments a bovine enteric coronavirus and assessing a concentration procedure based on viral adsorption on glass-powder at acid ph followed by alkaline-ph elution since cov is sensitive to acid ph 3 and alkaline ph ph  10 adsorption was optimal at ph 33 and elution at ph 9 under such conditions the overall efficiency of the concentration method appeared to be between 24 and 28 unfortunately since it was not possible to retrieve the full text of this publication no further information beside those included in the abstract could be reportedfollowing the sars outbreak of 2003 wang et al 2005c performed a study to evaluate the recovery from spiked sewage of sars-cov and of a surrogate virus bacteriophage f2 the concentration procedure foresaw the use of positively charged electropositive filter media particle silica gel plus aloh3 packed in a glass column according to a protocol previously described by li et al 1998 for enteric viruses hospital sewage and domestic sewage 100 ml were spiked with sars-cov and phage f2 passed through the glass column eluted from the filter media with 3  nutrient broth ph 72 and then polyethylene glycol peg precipitated the procedure gave recoveries of sars-cov ranging from 0 sewage from a housing estate to 214 sewage from the hospital with an average of 102the recovery of phage f2 under the same conditions were significantly higher from 336 to more than 100 this method therefore seemed more suitable for the concentration of enveloped viruses in agreement with the initial study proposing its use that showed recoveries of enterovirus and hepatitis a virus from tap water ranging from 887 to 960 li et al 1998
ye et al 2016 evaluated three methods for separating and concentrating viruses from the liquid fraction of municipal wastewater i peg precipitation ii ultracentrifugation iii ultrafiltration with centrifugal devices ye et al 2016 wastewater 250 ml for peg precipitation and ultrafiltration and 60 ml for ultracentrifugation was spiked with the rodent coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv and with the non-enveloped phage ms2 low mean recoveries 5 were achieved for both mhv and ms2 with the ultracentrifugation method this result was suggested to be related to virus inactivation by the high g-force of the ultracentrifugation recovery of mhv was low 5 also with the peg precipitation method whose performance for ms2 concentration was instead significantly higher 431 finally the optimized ultrafiltration protocol adopted in the study provided the highest recoveries for both viruses 251 for mhv and 556 for phage ms2 results of ye and colleagues suggested that the peg precipitation method which is effective at recovering non-enveloped viruses from water samples may be not optimal for recovering infective enveloped viruses while ultrafiltration could be successfully applied for recovering cov however in this study only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters since viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers there is a need for analytical methods suitable to process large volumes of water it was therefore concluded by the authors that further progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow ultrafiltration to allow concentration of cov in waters from larger volumes of water
abd-elmaksoud and coworkers 2014 measured the effectiveness of glass wool filtration to simultaneously concentrate a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in runoff from agricultural fields using dairy manure as fertilizer viruses of bovine origin were used to spike 20 l of dechlorinated tap water including bovine coronavirus bocov bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 bvdv1 and bvdv2 bovine rotavirus group a borv and poliovirus 3 sabin moreover e coli o157nm and campylobacter jejuni were selected as bacterial pathogen three water turbidity levels were evaluated prepared by mixing dried agricultural soil into the 20 l of water after glass wool filtration elution was performed with 3 beef extract-glycine buffer ph 95 followed by flocculation with peg 8000 recovered organisms were enumerated by qpcr results showed that glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for the concentration of several waterborne pathogens simultaneously in details the average recoveries across the different turbidity levels tested were 181 for bocov 221 for borv 156 and 197 for bvdv1 and bvdv2 respectively higher recovery efficiencies were obtained for the non-enveloped virus poliovirus 3 579 and for the bacterial microorganisms e coli o157nm 548 and c jejuni 327 however the authors advised to use caution in the interpretation of these comparative results since the quantity of pathogens used for spiking varied for the different microorganisms precluding a clear differentiation of the effects on recovery efficiency of seeding quantities and pathogen type
blanco et al 2019 used adsorption to glass wool followed by elution with alkaline buffer and subsequent secondary concentration through peg 6000 precipitation the viruses used for the experimental procedures were hepatitis a virus hav non-enveloped and the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev large volumes of water 5 l and 50 l were used for method optimization and performance characterization several steps of the elution procedure were modified compared to other published glass wool protocols to improve the recovery of tgev and virus recoveries were ascertained by real-time qpcr recovery of the initial experiments 5 l of water adsorption to the positively charged glass wool matrix elution with glycinebeef extract buffer at ph 95 with 10 min of contact showed that tgev efficiently adsorbed onto the glass wool attachment of 571 but it was poorly eluted from it with an overall recovery of 26 the increase of buffer ph to 110 provided an improvement of elution efficiency and a final recovery of 288 further performance improvements could be obtained by changing the length of the elution incubation subsequent experiments for the concentration of hav and tgev from 50 l of spiked water samples were therefore all performed using an elution buffer ph 110 results showed that addition of tween 80 hampered the recovery of tgev possibly by damaging the lipid-containing envelope of viruses recirculation of the eluent at ph 110 for 20 min was instead beneficial to the elution and provided recoveries of 180 and 239 for tgev and hav respectively similarly increasing peg concentration from 10 to 20 in the secondary concentration showed a significant improvement of the recovery 513 and 472 for tgev and hav respectively following optimization of the method the procedure provided a recovery efficiency of 51 for tgev and 45 for hav in spiked surface water overall the study by blanco et al 2019 clearly demonstrated that the concentration procedures commonly used for non-enveloped viruses need adaptation to yield satisfactory performances on enveloped viruses like covto summarize this scoping review has highlighted several aspects of coronavirus research that need to be explored in depth1the evidence of the presence of cov in waters is currently very scarce and there is no evidence that human cov are present in surface or groundwater sources or transmitted through contaminated drinking-water2environmental factors such as temperature seem to affect the ability of cov to persist in water further studies are needed to investigate cov persistence in water in relation to climatic and seasonal conditions3although different studies showed different viral inactivation rates for cov in water based on the type of virus and the type of water generally there is evidence that cov is generally considered unstable in the environment and is more susceptible to oxidants such as chlorine than non-enveloped viruses4based on the few available data methods commonly used to concentrate and recover non-enveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other water matrices may not be appropriate to recover cov therefore future research should focus on the development of robust methods for concentrating cov and other enveloped viruses from large volumes of waters and from different types of water
the evidence-based knowledge here reported can be a key support for risk analysis in natural water resources and integrated water cycle according to the water and sanitation safety planning approaches as well as for the management and control of water-related risks during the pandemic covid-19 caused by sars-cov2further researches are needed to study the potential presence and fate of coronavirus and other enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater and drinking water and to develop robust methods for water analysisthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe world health organization who reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 known as covid-19 in late december 2019 in china as of april 5 2020 based on the who report ie httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports the numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and mortalities were 1133758 and 62784 respectively moreover the sequence similarity scores of covid-19 with bat sars-like sars-cov and mers-cov were about 99 96 and 50 respectively 1epidemiologically the covid-19 outbreak has spread to more than 200 countries resulting in who risk assessment status as very high for this purpose several authors have recently carried out their researches on covid-19 which were mostly based on clinical and epidemiological views and included the potential symptoms the ways of covid-19 transmission and epidemic issues 2 among them hellewell et al proposed a stochastic transmission model that resulted in the case and contact isolations to control the covid-19 outbreak 3 moreover peeri et al compared the epidemics of three types of coronaviruses namely sars mers and covid-19 they concluded that there were no frequent outbreaks found from two previous ones and the challenges for the covid-19 should be covered by the applications of the internet of things iot which will be beneficial for control the incidence among people 4 two systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies were available in the literature they proposed five useful factors ie clinical laboratory imaging features procalcitonin measurements outcomes of confirmed cases in predicting the severity of the covid-19 disease 5 6 7in the current study the comparisons between incidence and mortality as well as recovery and death rates among the countries for covid-19 and sars-cov with the higher incidence rates were performed using the meta-analysis approach developed in the meta-mums tool the statistical analyses used both subgroup forest plots using event rate and risk ratio statisticsdata for meta-analysis could be extracted from open datasets 8 the original and well-known data resources for covid-19 were world health organization who ie httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports and worldometers ie httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus the retrieved parameters for the countries to be meta-analyzed were total sample size cumulative confirmed cases cumulative mortalities and total recovered cases and the data for high-risk countries in terms of incidence related to covid-19 was extracted up to april 5 2020 moreover the summary table of sars-cov was available from httpswwwwhointcsrsarscountrycountry20030815pdfuaequals1 for the period november 16 2002august 7 2003the analysis environment was the meta-mums tool as a comprehensive meta-analysis tool without any limitations in number size and data entry 910 analysis of dichotomous data was done with a 95 confidence interval to set lower and upper limits based on risk ratio rr as well as event rate er when no interventions are involved 11 in all calculations and analyses the p-values less than 005 were statistically significantthe evaluation of heterogeneity between the analyzed countries was by calculating the i2 test and cochranes q test and whenever a significant heterogeneity was present a random-effects model was used otherwise we utilize a fixed-effects model additionally subgroup analysis was carried out among the target countries to compare the effect sizes of incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality using risk ratio and subgroup analysis was performed for comparing effect sizes of incidence mortality and recovery rates using event ratein the current meta-analysis n  1124243 patients of covid-19 infection and n  8346 of sars-cov were available and retrieved from the initial research of who and worldometer freely accessible databases the incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality ratios are also determined indeed subgroup analyses were also performed for evaluation of learning significant differences of er and rrevent rates of incidence recovery and mortality of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as the followingthe incidence event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 1

so the incidence rate of covid-19 is more than sars-cov p 0001 and the same outcomes apply to the cumulative incidence rates with p 0001the mortality event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as follows where the forest plots figure 1b shows the relationships between two viral diseaseslogit er  3113 ll  3439 ul  2786 p 0001

the mortality rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection p 0001 by also considering their cumulative mortality rate with p 0001recovery event rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 2

logit er  1706 ll  1137 ul  2276 p 0001
so the recovery rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection p 0001 with the same results using the cumulative recovery rate with p 0001incidence vs mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below the forest plots illustrated in figure 2b show the relations between the two diseaseslog rr  4089 ll  4512 ul  3666 p 0001

and the mortality rate is higher than the incidence rate in both infection groups and subgroup analysis showed that in sars infection the mortality rate is more than incidence rate in comparison to covid-19 disease p 0001 cumulative incidence vs mortality rateof covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p 0001recovery vs mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below the forest plots are illustrated in figure 3

which resulted the recovery rate is more than the mortality rate in both infectious groups and subgroup analysis has shown that in sars infection the recovery rate vs mortality rate is higher than that of covid-19 p 0008 and cumulative recovery rate vs mortality rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p 0001some recent news reported that the covid-19 has more mortality rate than the combination of sars and mers 12 however one should note that while this comes to statistical analysis the whole population of the world and countries are essential factorsthe rapid virus spread known as also super spreading people played a vital role in previous sars-cov case fatality rate of 96 and mers case fatality rate of about 38 outbreaks and also needs special attention in covid-19 as well 13in summary we demonstrated the statistical analyses of incidence mortality and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov along with their subgroups analysis and hopefully this would shed more evidence in controlling the new infectious diseasethe limitations of the current meta-analysis are as belowthe use of open datasetsall data were observational numbers reported for incidence mortality and recovery valuesonly the countries with higher incidence values those which are high-risk countries based on who criteria assessment are involved in the current meta-analysis which might be influenced by selection bias in the futuredue to the nature of the meta-analysis the evaluation of publication bias was not possible
the current meta-analysis provided more information on incidence mortality and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov infectious diseases based on event rate evaluation the incidence rate of covid-19 was higher than sars-covs where mortality and recovery rates for sars-cov were higher in comparison with covid-19 on the other hand the risk ratio and subgroup analysis of incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality for both covid-19 and sars-cov revealed new findings those were the higher mortality and recovery rates of both sars-cov and covid-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates respectivelythe authors declare that they have no conflict of interestthere are 15 million deaths from respiratory infections worldwide each year world health organization 2006 in the united states adults and children less than 5 years experience 1530 and 3555 respiratory illnesses per year respectively monto and sullivan 1993 viruses account for up to 69  of all respiratory

hospital attendants are believed to spread the virus sattar et al 2000few respiratory viruses are transmitted by one route only gwaltney et al 1978 brankston et al 2007 respiratory viruses may be spread by direct contact person-to-person the airborne route via droplets or by indirect contact via hands andor fomites goldmann 2000 barker et al 2001 brankston et al 2007 some respiratory viruses irritate the respiratory epithelium and induce coughing and sneezing thereby facilitating their transmission by not only the airborne route but also by environmental contamination with the generated aerosolsdroplets hall et al 1980 barker et al 2001 boone and gerba 2007 the primary route of transmission is at times difficult to determine and is often a point of contention among researchers in addition unusual circumstances or conditions may lead to an atypical route of transmission for respiratory viruses for instance environmental contamination by stools played a significant role in the transmission of sars coronavirus in certain outbreak populations in china dowell et al 2004 chu et al 2005 thomas et al 2008there is growing evidence that contaminated fomites inanimate surfaces play a key role in the spread of respiratory viruses morens and rash 1995 drinka et al 1996 goldmann 2000 barker et al 2001 dowell et al 2004 boone and gerba 2005 2007 chu et al 2005 kramer et al 2006 winther et al 2007 fomites may become contaminated with respiratory viruses by contact with body secretions or fluids or by contact with soiled hands also viruses may become aerosolized via talking sneezing coughing or vomiting and can then be deposited on fomite surfaces boone and gerba 2007 viruses can easily be spread to the mouth when fomites and subsequently the hands become contaminatedthere are also emerging zoonotic respiratory viral agents such as coronavirus sars and influenza virus which could potentially be transmitted by foods depending on the produce structures

viruses were then purified by centrifugation 1000g to remove cell debris followed by polyethylene glycol 9  peg 05 moll nacl precipitation pv1 and ad2 were further purified by extraction with equal volumes of vertrel xf dupont wilmington de usa emulsified and centrifuged 7500g for 15 min the upper aqueous layer containing viruses was then aliquoted into sterile 1-ml vialsfor ad2 and cov229e viral titrations were performed using the reed-muench method payment and trudel 1993 to determine the tissue culture infectious dose that affected 50  of the inoculated wells tcid50 cells were observed for cytopathogenic effects over 7 cov229e to 12 ad2 days pv1 was titered via the plaque assay method bidawid et al 2003 all purified virus stocks were stored at 80 c until used in experimentsiceberg lettuce lactuca sativa strawberries fragaria ananassa and raspberries rubus idaeus were purchased directly from local markets the produce samples were placed in 250-ml autoclavable wide mouth bottles with screw caps nalgene west chester pa usa to about one-third capacity in the following manner the outer three or four leaves of lettuce were discarded whole interior leaves were cut into pieces 2  2 cm with a sterile razor approximately 810 g of cut leaves were added to each lettuce sample bottle two whole strawberries weighing between 15 and 20 g for a total of 3040 g and four whole raspberries weighing between 4 and 5 g each for a total of 1620 g were added to each of the strawberry and raspberry sample bottles respectivelythe efficiency of recovery of each virus from produce was first assessed the produce was inoculated with either 10 ml of ad2 25  109 tcid50 total 5 ml of cov229e 50  104 tcid50 total or 10 ml of pv1 18  107 plaque forming units pfu total using a pipette to carefully and evenly add the viral solutions drop-by-drop onto the produce the caps of the bottles were then replaced and the bottles were manually rotated to ensure total coverage of the produce by the virus suspension the inoculated produce was then incubated for 15 min at room temperature before processing all of the tests were performed in triplicateviruses were eluted from the produce by the addition of 90 ml of phosphate-buffered saline pbs ph 90 sigma-aldrich st louis mo usa to the bottles for the pv1 and ad2 experiments only 45 ml of pbs was added to the samples inoculated with cov229e to minimize the amount the virus was being diluted since the initial stock concentration was fairly low the bottles were then placed on an orbital shaker new brunswick scientific edison nj usa at 200 rpm for 10 minthe pbs was collected using a pipette and placed in sterile bottles these eluates containing organic debris were clarified by centrifugation at 1400g for 15 min at 5 c ja-14 rotor j2-21 centrifuge beckman coulter inc fullerton ca usa to remove large suspended materials butot et al 2007 the ph was then adjusted to 70 to 74 aliquots of 47 ml were filtered through cellulose nitrate membrane syringe filters with a pore size of 022 m acrodisc pall corporation ann arbor mi usa pre-wetted using 5 ml of 3  beef extract ph 90 becton dickinson and company franklin lakes nj usa to prevent virus adsorption to the membrane croci et al 2008 since all of the samples could not be assayed at once the filtered aliquots were frozen for subsequent virus assay at 20 c for ad2 and pv1 and at 80 c for cov229e since cov229e does not survive very well at 20 c the tcid50 method was used to assay the recovered ad2 and cov229e and the plaque assay method was used to assay the recovered pv1 as described previouslyto assess the survival of these viruses on produce the produce samples inoculated with virus as described previously were stored at 4 c for up to 10 days for ad2 and pv1 and 8 days for cov229e the following initial inocula titers were used 20  108 tcid50 of ad2 12  106 tcid50 of cov229e and 14  107 pfu of pv1 duplicate sample bottles were removed immediately time  0 h and also after various time intervals 1 2 4 8 or 10 days and eluted for viruses as described previously the filtered aliquots were also frozen for subsequent virus assay at 20 c for ad2 and pv1 and at 80 c for cov229e and assayed as described previouslya students t test two-tailed assuming unequal variances was used to compare the survival of the viruses on different types of produce a p value of  005 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between the levels of the recovered virusestable 1 shows the recovery efficiencies of ad2 cov229e and pv1 from produce ad2 was recovered with an efficiency of 565  from lettuce its recoveries from strawberries and raspberries were lower 3235  the recovery efficiencies of cov229e and pv1 were only determined from lettuce and strawberries raspberries were eliminated from these experiments because of their short shelf-life before deterioration pv1 had the greatest recovery efficiency from lettuce 767  of any of the viruses on any of the produce nevertheless both pv1 and cov229e were not recovered well from strawberries 006 
table 2 shows the survival of ad2 on produce after 8 days at 4 c the recovered ad2 levels decreased by 175 log10 on lettuce 165 log10 on strawberries and 060 log10 on raspberries after 10 days these reductions increased to 197 log10 238 log10 and 114 log10 respectively
table 3 shows the survival of cov229e on lettuce stored at 4 c strawberries were not included in the survival experiment with cov299e because of the inability to detect the virus during the initial recovery efficiency determination tests cov229e declined by 020 log10 after 2 days of storage and could no longer be detected by day 4 131 log10 reduction
pv1 survival on lettuce stored at 4 c was fairly stable table 4 with no observed reductions until day 8 036 log10 by day 10 this reduction had increased to 103 log10 even though the recovery efficiency of pv1 from strawberries table 1 was very low 006  the recovered virus levels could still be used to determine its survival reductions in pv1 were observed as early as day 1 on strawberries 084 log10 nevertheless the measured reductions did not continue to increase over time during storage fluctuating between a low of 039 log10 day 10 and 124 log10 day 8 this is likely due to the variability in the assay in addition it is possible that the number of viruses recovered from strawberries on day 0 was overestimated therefore the reductions calculated using this number would be overestimated this seems likely since the reductions observed were immediate but then remained relatively stable for 9 days
in this study we determined the efficiency of recovery of two human respiratory viruses ad2 and cov229e and one enteric virus pv1 from lettuce strawberries and raspberries in addition the survival of these three viruses on produce during storage at a refrigeration temperature of 4 c was determined such survival data are important in determining the risks of exposure over time following the contamination of produce and its subsequent storagethe recovery efficiency of 565  for ad2 from lettuce was comparable to the 55  of enteric adenovirus type 6 recovered from lettuce by ward et al 1982 in a previous study nevertheless our recovery of ad2 from strawberries and raspberries was lower than those reported for enteric viruses 50  in other studies bidawid et al 2000 le guyader et al 2004 butot et al 2007 for example bidawid et al 2000 reported a recovery of 81  of hepatitis a virus from strawberries however they used immunomagnetic beads and positively charged virosorb 1mds filters to assist in virus capture and concentrationpv1 was recovered with an efficiency of 767  from lettuce in this study this is greater than the 58  recovery efficiency reported by ward et al 1982 in contrast the recovery of pv1 from strawberries was only 006  demonstrating that virus recoveries from different types of produce can vary significantly similarly the recovery efficiency of cov229e from lettuce was 196  whereas the virus was not recovered from strawberries such differences between the recoveries of viruses from berries versus lettuce are likely due to the fact that fruits such as strawberries and raspberries have a porous surface texture which may trap viruses beyond the reach of chemical disinfectants or eluents richards 2001 alternatively the elution process itself may cause damage to the surfaces of soft fruits resulting in greater virus retention the low ph of fruits which are typically below those of vegetables may also affect the sorption of viruses to the produce surface and therefore their recovery the ph of strawberries is 3039 raspberries is 2935 and iceberg lettuce is 60 martin-diana et al 2005 roberts et al 2005a b basic buffers ph 7495 are recommended as eluents to extract viruses from acidic fruits in order to prevent a drop in the ph of the eluent during the elution process which may reduce virus recovery croci et al 2008 le guyader et al 2004 reported that detecting viruses on berries particularly raspberries is difficult because of the presence of various inhibitors as well as the low ph butot et al 2007 found recovery efficiencies of 199 042 and 11  of hepatitis a virus norovirus and rotavirus respectively from fresh strawberries and similarly low efficiencies of 23 31 and 13  for these three viruses respectively from frozen raspberriesduring postharvest transportation strawberry shelf-life can be increased to 510 days postharvest by using controlled atmospheres while maintaining the transport temperature between 0 and 5 c transfresh corporation 2011 strawberry producers also recommend not washing berries until just before serving and to avoid contact with moisture eg misters in the food market such moisture causes rapid breakdown of the berries raspberries are very perishable and should always be kept between 0 and 1 c under ideal conditions strawberries should have a shelf-life of 25 days and raspberries should have a shelf-life of 12 days in the consumers refrigerator in the virus survival experiments the produce samples were stored in covered bottles to avoid evaporation of the inoculum volume during storage however the fruits started to deteriorate before day 10 due to the excess moisture raspberry deterioration was much more pronounced than that observed with strawberries for this reason the survival of pv1 and cov229e on raspberries was not determinedad2 survived the longest on raspberries followed by lettuce and then by strawberries such observed differences in ad2 decay rates between raspberries and strawberries may be due to an uneven virus distribution over the fruit surfaces or to differences in the berry surface characteristics the ad2 reductions between raspberries and lettuce were significantly different after 8 days of storage at 4 c and between raspberries and strawberries after 1 daycov229e was very sensitive to the elution process the recovery efficiencies were low with no virus recovered from strawberries and only 196  recovered from lettuce in addition the cov229e fell to below the detection limit of our assay within 4 days of storage at 4 c these results are comparable with those obtained by gundy et al 2009 who reported that coronaviruses die-off very rapidly in wastewaterenveloped viruses such as cov229e are typically less stable in the environment than non-enveloped viruses such as ad2 and pv1 watanabe et al 1989 barker et al 2001 pv1 can withstand a wide range of ph and temperature variations jaykus 2000 the acidity of the strawberries may therefore inactivate cov229e more readily than the non-enveloped ad2 and pv1 in addition some fruits including strawberries blueberries and grapes contain quercetin which has been shown to have antiviral properties in cell culture experiments davis et al 2008in this study the enteric pv1 appeared to survive longer than both respiratory viruses on lettuce and strawberries with only 103 log10 reductions after 10 days of storage at 4 c compared to no cov229e being recovered after 4 days on lettuce and reductions of 197 log10 and 238 log10 of ad2 on lettuce and strawberries respectively after 10 days survival studies of poliovirus on soft fruit and salad vegetables performed by kurdziel et al 2001 found a linear decline of poliovirus of 0086 log10 per day for lettuce stored at 4 c for 15 days they reported a decline of 012 log10 of poliovirus on frozen strawberries stored at 20 c for 15 days raspberry samples displayed severe deterioration by day 9 but no significant decline in poliovirus was observedthe results of this study demonstrate that respiratory viruses may persist on fresh fruit and vegetables for several days at the refrigeration temperature commonly used to store fresh produce in the average consumer household contamination of fresh produce may therefore result in the transmission of not only the enteric viruses that are traditionally considered foodborne pathogens but also possibly respiratory viruses such as adenoviruses coronaviruses and influenza viruses that can infect via contact with mucosal membranes considering the low infectious dose of many viral agents there will always be a risk of infection from the exposure to or consumption of food contaminated with respiratory or enteric viruses if no regular preventive produce surface sanitization is performed this is of particular concern for uncooked fruits and vegetables in addition food handlers that are ill with respiratory rather than non-gastrointestinal disease could still pose a potential health risk for food consumers particularly while preparing finger foods that come into contact with the consumers hands which can then transfer the viruses to the mucosa via hand to mouth contact or by rubbing the eyes or nose hendley et al 1973 goldmann 2000 the world health organization has highlighted the importance of hygiene particularly that of hands in minimizing the spread of respiratory tract infections hendley et al 1973 rusin et al 2002 bell 2006 numerous respiratory viruses can survive on hands for significant periods of time and may be transferred from hands to fomites such as produce and back again hall et al 1980 ansari et al 1991 morens and rash 1995 barker et al 2001 in addition some respiratory coronaviruses eg sars coronavirus and adenoviruses are also capable of replication in the gut and there is thus the potential for acquisition through the consumption of contaminated producesince the initial epidemics in wuhan city china coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has rapidly spread globally with 842370 and 2314621 laboratory-confirmed cases in china and throughout the world as of april 21st 2020 respectively the number

to our knowledge this is the first multicenter randomized clinical trial that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of lh capsule a chinese herb product in patients with covid-19 overall treatment with lh capsules for 14 days resulted in a significantly higher rate of and a shorter time to symptom recovery than control group usual treatment the rate of recovery of fever fatigue and coughing was also higher in treatment group the rate of conversion of viral rna assay however did not reach to statistical significance lh capsule had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of covid-19sars-cov-2 has been shown to result in an injury of the respiratory tract nervous system general office of the national health and health commission 2020 the liver chai et al 2020 the heart esophagus kidney urinary bladder and the jejunum li et al 2020 zou et al 2020 the susceptibility of sars-cov-2 among the whole population might be related to the ability to potently bind with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 zhou et al 2020 sars-cov-2 could infect various cells in human with similar biological behaviors of sars-cov huang and herrmann 2020 zhou et al 2020 from the perspective of tissue tropism the pathological features of covid-19 mainly resembled those of sars coronavirus infection zhao et al 2020 in light of the high levels of homology of sequence among sars-cov-2 sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus medications that have been proven to be effective for sars and mers might also be adopted to the treatment of covid-19 li and de clercq 2020 unfortunately no existing antiviral medications are available for the treatment of covid-19based on a nationwide study with 1099 patients from 552 hospital throughout mainland china we have recently reported that fever accounted for 887 of patients and cough accounted for 678 of patients after hospital admission guan et al 2020 in light of the lack of validated effective therapeutic approaches the medications that could ameliorate fever fatigue and coughing would be valuable for the clinical management of covid-19 lh capsules which is a patented product have been marketed since the outbreak of sars in 2003 in china the latest research showed that lh conferred suppression of the cytopathic effect of sars-cov-2 in vitro and reduced the viral loads in the cytoplasm and cellular membrane li et al 2020 lh could also suppress the replication of sars-cov zhu et al 2003 h3n2 h1n1 and h7n9
in vitro chinese academy of military hospital 2009 ding et al 2017 duan et al 2011 mo et al 2007 the inflammatory cytokine storm has been regarded as an excessive host-defense response to the virus xu et al 2020 zhe xu 2020 which can cause diffuse lung injury and predispose to the development of severe disease suppression of excessive release of inflammatory meditators is the holy grail for halting the progression to severe disease xu et al 2020 recent studies indicated that lh could dose-dependently inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor- interleukin-6 macrophage chemokine protein-1 and induced protein-10 li et al 2020 and could also effectively abrogate the expression of tumor necrosis factor- interleukin-6 interleukin-1 interleukin-2 interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 mo et al 2007 thus ameliorating lung injury associated with inflammatory cell infiltration cui et al 2015 these in vitro findings have provided with the rationale for clinical application of lh capsules in covid-19in our study treatment with lh capsules for 14 days markedly improved the rate of symptom recovery 577 at day 5 803 at day 10 and 915 at day 14 the time to symptom recovery was also significantly shorter in treatment group overall lh capsules have shortened the duration of fever fatigue and coughing by 1 3 and 3 days respectively the higher rate of clinical cure and recovery of chest ct manifestations could also be associated with the activity against sars-cov-2 and probably the anti-inflammatory effects there was a lack of statistical significance for the difference in the rate of and the time to conversion of viral assays these findings differed from those in the in vitro studies li et al 2020 possibly because of the difference in the model for observation human vs cell models and the study endpoints changes in the viral loads in human respiratory tract specimens vs viral loads in the cytoplasm in vitro no serious adverse events were reported supporting the safety of lh capsules for the treatment of covid-19lh consists of the key components such as lonicera japonica and forsythia suspense which could block the binding of sars-cov-2 with the angiotensin

injury via the suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis huangfu et al 2019 and abrogation of pulmonary inflammation yao and luo 2020 in addition rheum palmatum could effectively antagonize the binding of spike protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme ho et al 2007 and suppress the excessive release of inflammatory mediators thus ameliorating the lung injury dong et al 2017 these observations have provided the evidence regarding the antiviral effects of lh capsulesthe exploration of repurposed chinese herb product would be valuable to the treatment of covid-19 because apart from convalescent plasma no other medications with proven efficacy exist our findings indicated that lh capsules could be recommended to patients with covid-19 for reducing the symptom burden and improving clinical outcomes however there are some limitations of the study design no blinding was implemented because of the urgency of the outbreak that entailed a timely treatment and placebo-controlled trial would be unethical in light of the rapid outbreak of communicable diseases such as covid-19 the duration of treatment was established empirically and whether a prolonged duration would translate into the greater efficacy warrants further investigation an extended study would be needed to thoroughly explore the effects of lh capsules on the viral shedding and the resolution of all symptomsin summary lh capsules confer therapeutic effects on covid-19 by improving the recovery rate of symptoms shortening the time to symptom recovery and improving the recovery of chest radiologic abnormalities in light of the efficacy and safety profiles lh capsules could be considered for the treatment of covid-19 future double-blind prospective randomized controlled trials

noneat the world health international conference in geneva in january 2020 the world health organization who announced an outbreak of the new coronavirus the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus 2 from wuhan china has continued to spread around the world since january 2020 and has turned into a pandemic of the coronavirus disease covid-19 12 due to the rapid spreading potential and the absence of vaccines and drugs the contagious covid-19 devastated normal life around the world currently covid-19 has infected more than half a million of the population has killed more than 25000 people and has forced more than 3 billion to stay in their homes 3 many people started getting pneumonia without any reason and most of the cases were linked to wuhan seafood market where they sell fish and trade live animals the new coronaviruses lurking around the world are threatening our rule and the prevalence of fear and panic is increasing this has also affected the cryptocurrency market 45 the country in which the coronavirus has caused the most devastation after china is italy in italy hundreds of people are dying every day due to this deadly virus the corona virus is 900 times smaller than a human hair despite its size this small virus has scared the whole world in december 2019 the first case of covid-19 came from wuhan city in china 6-8during the chinese new year migration the virus spread to other chinese provinces in early and mid-january 2020 the who 3 revealed that cases began to be detected in other countries by international travelers due to a lack of knowledge about this virus the covid-19 pandemic placed tremendous strain on everyone around the world to prevent further transmission strong preventive measures have intensified week-to-week however the numbers of infected cases are consistently increasing around the world even after undergoing lockdown mathematical approaches have been widely used to infer critical epidemiological transitions and parameters of covid-19 epidemic curve fitting surveillance data during the early transmission and other epidemic models have been frequently applied to generate forecasts of the covid-19 pandemic across the world 9-11 this study aims to identify the top 15 countries with the most confirmed cases with spatial mapping a comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases deaths and recoveries and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average arima model was used for predicting the spread of covid-19 trajectories for the next 2 months until july 7 2020various studies have been presented for forecasting many epidemic diseases this research study analyzes dynamic models to generate 20-day forecasts of cumulative confirmed deaths and recoveries from covid-19 cases by country territory or conveyance generated on april 24 2020 the united states spain italy france germany the united kingdom turkey iran china russia brazil canada belgium the netherlands and switzerland were taken from the top 20 countries based on cumulative effect data the arima model assigns a weight to the considered past values and an error value to correct the modelling other basic regression and exponential models use all past values to predict future values so the arima model is preferred this study analyzed and extracted worldwide data based upon a time series data-based advanced prediction arima model approach for the top 15 covid-19-infected countrieswe used data from worldometer which reports the approximate data of cumulative cases for more than 170 countries worldwide including state- or province-level cases for some countries 12 we have collected the case data for each day at given stipulated times from january 21 2020 to april 24 2020 furthermore we preprocessed the top 15 countries data with their spatial locations to collect and create some spatial attributes for the overall available data sets to forecast the trajectory of covid-19 cases in addition as whole worldwide data is not available for stipulated times we did not create any worldwide pandemic forecasting some dates with cases of confirmed covid-19 along with total cumulative results of recovered cases and death cases were analyzed using statistical analysis along with spatial extinct we used the arima model with r r foundation for statistical computing and validated it using akaike information criterion aic the new projected data was used up to july 2 2020 for the creation of a trajectory projected score for each category case confirmed recovered and deathrecent reported cumulative data of confirmed cases deaths and recoveries of covid-19 from january 21 to april 26 2020 were obtained from worldometer the reported data were used to predict more than 60 days and to understand the positive effects in the near future as well as the projected trends over trajectories the different statistical phenomenological models in the r-language platform were used to analyze the disease-based trajectories model for prediction purposes the four models were used to analyze the aggregate data set for time series analysis this includes the arima model which is a mass model of two different models including the autoregression ar model and the moving average ma model 13 this model also used aic statistics and coverage of regression analysisanother type of covid-19 like sars disease was analyzed without breaking the current situation or predicting the future perspective 14 the vector auto-average model was used to predict the spatial extinct while using remote sensing data for the purpose of the creation of a worldwide geographic information system gis map for three different variables 15 these three variables in the gis environment created a map of cumulative confirmed cases by country as well as recovered and death maps 16 the use of another statistical analysis was a generalized logistic growth model which generally is depicted as a scaling parameter for integrating an additional result-oriented value put method 17 some epidemic models used in disease epidemic conditions measure oscillates which are multiple peak parameters inferred in subepidemic and pandemic conditions to determine the projected outcomes 18after standardizing all the models the data of the top 20 countries were included to analyze the forecasting models of differential spatial adjacent and projected trajectories which were analyzed up to july 2 2020 we used the gis and remote sensing to determine the pandemic mapping and analyze the upcoming effects of covid-19ma is the present value of a series which is defined as a linear combination of past errors assuming the errors to be independently distributed with the normal distribution 1319 order q is defined aswhereorder q of the ma process is obtained from the autocorrelation function acf plot this is the lag after which acf crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time we combined differencing with ma and ar models and the combined model can be expressed ashere yt is the differenced series the predictors on the right-hand side include both lagged values of yt and lagged errors we call this an arima p d q model wherethe top 15 countries were identified using mapping of cumulative confirmed covid-19 cases from january to april 24 2020 for 200 nations as presented in figure 1 the top 15 countries with a high number of confirmed cases were stratified to include the data in a mathematical model the top 15 countries the united states spain italy france germany the united kingdom turkey iran china russia brazil canada belgium the netherlands and switzerland cumulative cases deaths and recoveries from covid-19 were compared in figure 2 the united states the united kingdom turkey china and russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease there was a fast recovery ratio in china switzerland germany iran and brazil but a slow recovery ratio in the united states the united kingdom the netherlands russia and italy as shown in figure 2 in addition there were higher death rate ratios in italy and the united kingdom and lower death rate ratios in russia turkey china and the united states figure 2furthermore data smoothening was applied to stabilize the data by removing changes in the level of a time series and therefore eliminating or reducing the trend and seasonality after this the forecast prediction model was applied by using ar and ma models to generate plots of the different trends in upcoming days the arima model was validated for the available current data using the aic value it estimates that the out-of-sample prediction error and lowest value are preferable its value were around 20 14 and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases deaths and recoveries from covid-19 respectively which represents less error the outcome of these predictions is presented in figure 3 our findings revealed linearity in the confirmed cumulative cases and showed a rapid exponential growth phase in the world which might occur roughly from april 8 to april 24 2020 when the number of covid-19 cases may rise steeply to nearly 1 million in the united states 220000 in spain 200000 in italy 180000 in france and 190000 in germany other countries that have a smaller number of cases but show a declining upward trend include switzerland germany and italy figure 2 however the cases of covid-19 in china remain stable figure 2 the arima model predicted confirmed cases deaths and recoveries for the next month from april 24 to july 7 2020 using the past 3 months of data in figure 3 cyan color figure 4 brown color and figure 5 green color with 95 confidence intervals along with the 95 confidence predicted line after april 24 the 80 and 70 confidence wide values are shown in light grey and light-yellow colors respectively the wide confidence intervals help to manage any sudden changes in the prediction of dynamic covid-19 casesduring the next 2 months between april 24 and july 7 2020 the model predicted that the confirmed cases deaths and recoveries would be doubled in all countries except china switzerland and germany figures 3-5 it was also observed that the death and recovery rates will be faster when compared to confirmed cases during the next 2 months the associated mortality rate will be much higher in the united states spain and italy followed by france germany and the united kingdom the recovery rates will stay slow at first but then rapidly increase in the united states italy germany and france by the end of june 2020 figure 5the covid-19 daily data was collected and cumulatively represented as a spatial map for more than 170 countries and territories the spatial map is useful to identify the intensity of covid-19 infections in the top 15 countries and the continents the recent reported data for confirmed cases deaths and recoveries for the last 3 months from january to april 2020 was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries the arima model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases deaths and recoveries for the top 15 countries from april 24 to july 7 2020 its value was represented with 95 80 and 70 confidence intervals and the 95 confidence intervals were shown as the median interval between the 80 and 70 wide values the validation of the arima model was carried out using the aic for the available recent data its values were about 20 14 and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases deaths and recoveries from covid-19 respectively which represents acceptable results the observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases deaths and recoveries will double in all countries except china switzerland and germany it was also observed that the death and recovery rates were faster when compared to confirmed cases during the next 2 months the associated mortality rate will be much higher in the united states spain and italy followed by france germany and the united kingdom the limitation of the arima model is that it does not support any volatility or in-between changes in the prediction periods the accuracy of the countries data accumulated from worldometer was a matter of trust for the representation of the whole studythe forecast analysis of covid-19 dynamics showed a different angle for the whole world and it looks scarier than imagined interestingly the recovery numbers also look promising with resistance starting by july 2020 thus a slowdown in the surge of the covid-19 pandemic during the proceeding months depends upon various administrative interventions and public awareness about the spread of the covid-19 pandemiccovid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus which has first been originated in wuhan city hubei provinces of china 1 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a new type of virus family that has not been earlier identified in people the virus seems to be transmitted mostly through the minute respiratory droplets via coughing sneezing or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity these droplets can then be inhaled or they can land on surfaces that others may come into touch with who can then get contaminate when they contact their eyes mouth or nosethe novel coronavirus can live on different surface like few days stainless steel and plastic and few hours cardboard and copper however the amount of viable virus declines over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection in humans the symptoms of this virus can be experienced in between 1 to 14 days from the day of infection from then it has been spreading at the speed of knots giving no time to prepare against a newly identified infectious and notorious virus which have compelled the who to declare covid-19 as a pandemic 3 due to its fast human to human transmission and people got infected in every continent and it had already taken so many lives the statistics and graph for increasing cases active cases have been shown in the figure 1
 symptoms of coronavirus change in severity from having no symptoms at all being asymptomatic to having fatigue cough fever general weakness sore throatmuscular pain and in the most extreme cases sepsis severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndromeand septic shock all potentially leading to death reports show that clinical deterioration can occur quickly often during the 14 days of disease of late anosmia loss of the sense of smell have been reported as a one of the symptom of a coronavirus infection there is already conformation from many regions such as italy china and south korea that patients with committed sars-cov-2 infection have developed anosmiahyposmia in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms still there is no proper treatment drugs or vaccine for coronavirus disease several random drugs are being tried to target the virus on severely affected coronavirus patients however the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomized controlled trialsseveral clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available as this is a new virus no vaccine is currently available although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans 5 till today covid-19 has been infected the citizens of more than 212 countries leads to 3747356 patients out of which 258970 people had lost their lives and 1250693 people 6 gets recovered but due to the virus bi-phasic nature there may be chances of infection again in those recovered casesdue to an insufficient number of test kits ventilators oxygen tanks hospital beds and unavailability of proper treatment or vaccine it is very important to analyze the growth rates of positive cases number of recoveries and other factors that affect the growth of this virus to the same extent proper arrangements can be made to prevent losses of lives and to have proper insights of the condition for example based on the analysis of data the government can have the prior information to the number of cases till a particular day and before that day they can arrange all the necessary medical equipment or which mitigations to be done to prevent losses of lives nowadays machine learning methods have been widely used in healthcare field 7 8 and for having much faster and efficient prediction of covid-19 infected personin this work the support vector regression svr 9 10 11 model is used to solve the four different types of covid-19 related problems the proposed method will be fitted into the dataset containing the total number of covid19 positive cases and the number of recoveries for different countries like mainland china us italy south korea and india and with the help of the proposed method to predict the future number of total cases active cases and recoveries these tasks can help a countryregion to understand the spreading of the virus facilitateaware people start mitigations itll also help that regioncountry to be prepared for whats will happen in the future which may help in saving lives and agony and compare proposed method results with other well know regression models such as simple linear regression polynomial regression 12 and another task containing the weather data for regions like new york citynyc and milano italy to analyze the correlation between different weather parameters and the total number of cases pearsons method is used this will help in understanding the effects of weather conditions on the virus spreadsupport vector machines svm 15 is a supervised learning algorithm this algorithm is used for classification and regression problems svr is based on the same principles as svm for classification ie to find a hyperplane in a d-dimensional space d is the number of features that uniquely classifies the data points svr uses a non-parametric technique which means the output from the svr model does not depend on distributions of the dependent and independent variables svr technique is basically dependent on kernel functions which allows for the construction of a non-linear model without changing the explanatory variables which helps in better interpretation of the resultant model in these algorithms a hyperplane is found that separates the different features the produced model by svm does not depend on the training points that lie outside the margin but instead depends on a subset of the training data as the cost function similarly in svr support vectors find the closest data points and the actual function represented by them we get closest to the actual curve if the distance between the support vectors to the regressed curve is maximuma hyperplane is a function that classifies the points in a higher dimension or other words hyperplanes are the boundaries that help in the classification of the data points if the margin for any hyperplane is maximum then that hyperplane is the optimal hyperplane the points which are closest to hyperplane are called support vector points and the distance of the vectors from the hyperplane are called the margins as shown in figure 2
farther the support vector points from the hyperplane more is the probability that the points will be correctively classified in their respective region or classes thus the equation of the hyperplane in the d dimension can be given as1zl011x1l2x2l3x3l0i1nlixil0l1txbl1txwhere lil0l1l2
b  biased term l
0 and x  variables kernel is an important part of svr the kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors x and y in some high dimensional feature space kernel trick is used in svr which simply means to replace the dot product of two vectors by the kernel functionthe outbreak of covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis and its starting to influence important aspects of daily life for example bans have been placed on hotspot countries international manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in china have been halted altogether in highly affected areas people are starting to stock up on essential goods such that in order to predict how the virus could spread across different countries and regions different regression models were to be used to predict the total number of positive cases the main goal of this task was to build and compare regression models that can predict the progression of the total positive covid 19 cases from different regions that may help mitigation efforts the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the number that will reach of many cases this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions predicting total number of cases in different regions are show in figure 3

were scaled before usein fig 4a shows the growth rate of the total number of active cases in mainland china region china started its complete lockdown from early january and the total number of active cases of mainland china is decreasing at a satisfying rate the predicted values for the total number of cases till day 93 with simple linear regression method is 1414 with the polynomial regression method is 6371 and the proposed svr method is 1706 whereas the actual number active cases was 23 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 80  8546  and 9701  respectivelythe growth rate of the total number of active cases in us country is shown in fig 4b us havent opted complete lockdown strategy but instead partially closed schools and other gathering places and promoted social distancing and personal hygiene among citizens mitigation started around 19th march 2020 and as shown in the figure the total number of active cases of us is not seen to be lowering down the predicted values for the total number of cases till day 93 with simple linear regression method is 122606 with the polynomial regression method is 174969 and the proposed svr method

24th march 2020 it is clear that the total number of active cases of india is not decreasing but despite such a dense population the condition of india is better than most other countries the predicted values for the total number of cases till day 93 with simple linear regression method is 8733 with the polynomial regression method is 19248 and the proposed svr method is 16283 whereas the actual number of active cases was 18252 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 555  9958  and 996  respectivelysince no vaccine for the virus has yet been discovered it is important to see how many of the patients will recover from this virus and how and when the epidemic will end the main objective of this task was to predict how many people were going to recover based on old recovery recordssuch that in order to predict how many people will actually recover records for the number of recovered patients across different countries were taken the goal of solving this task helps us to understand how the epidemic will end ie how many patients will recover the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection from the older known methods since no vaccine or cure is yet discovered and by predicting the time that will be taken by all the patients to recover we will be able to understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to endto prepare the dataset for this task firstly dates were converted to day number taking 22 jan 2020 as day 1 and 24 april 2020 as day 93 then total number recoveries till that day were extracted region wise in order of day number next the day number and recovery counts were scaled to observe clearer results for different affected countries a linear regression and a polynomial regression model was fitted and visualized to the dataset to predict the number of recoveries of affected patients in that particular region in the polynomial regression model the model was fitted with different polynomial degrees to find which degree curve fits best then in the urge to seek for better results an svr model with radial basis function kernel rbf was fitted and visualized to predict the number of recoveries in that particular region then the accuracy of all the models was calculated and compared using the coefficient of determination to see how well each model predicts results
figure 5

shapecovid-19 causes illness in humans and creates severe damage in the lungs however covid-19 has killed many people in the entire world in this paper we are proposing the support vector regression method based navel coronavirus analysis on five different tasks main novelty in this work is instead of simple regression line we use supported vectors also to get better classification accuracythe main advantage of doing the first task would be that this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions with the help of second task will have an idea about how well the mitigations are working and the actions that are taken till date how effective are they or how many cases have been prevented by this the advantage of doing third task would be that we will have an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection from the older known methods since no vaccine or cure is yet discovered and by predicting the time that will be taken by all the patients to recover we will be able to understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to end with fourth task we will be able to observe and analyze how fast or slow the virus is spreading among regions therefore which areas needs more attention or not finally fifth task create better surroundings for the infected patient to reduce the spread the people can also be warned if they should avoid humidity or not and high temperature or no pearsons correlation method gives a clear understanding of the correlation between the spread and weather conditions in all tasks the proposed support vector regression method based coronavirus analysis given promising results compared with other well know regression methods on the first four tasksauthor agreement statement we the undersigned declare that

an independent experimental trial consisted of seeding the seven test organisms into 20 l dechlorinated tap water from a groundwater source and pumping the seeded water by peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 l min1 from carboys through a glass wool filter the bacteria test organisms were not included in every trial all tubing and containers had previously been disinfected with 05  chlorine for at least 30 min followed by chlorine neutralization with 005 mol l1 na2s2o3 and rinsed with sterile 18 mohm water three water turbidity levels were evaluated these were prepared by mixing into the 20-l test water volumes dried agricultural soil surface horizon of withee silt loam at 0 g l1 05 ntu 127 g l1 215 ntu and 275 g l1 447 ntu ambient water ph was 76 and all samples were adjusted to ph 70 before glass wool filtration by the addition of 1 mol l1 hcl a 10 m nominal pore size polypropylene prefilter macmaster-carr elmhurst il was used for 215 ntu and 447 ntu water matrices to prevent clogging of the glass wool filterglass wool filters were eluted in the direction opposite to the original flow with two 80 ml elutions of 3  beef extract-glycine buffer beg at ph 95 goyal and gerba 1980 the first eluent was allowed to soak the filter for 15 min before adding the second eluent which was immediately pushed through the filter by air eluates containing suspended sediments were centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min and the solution was saved the soil pellet was resuspended in beg ph 95 and centrifuged again at 1000g for 5 min the solutions were added to the original eluate and adjusted to ph 7075 with 1 mol l1 hcl and then flocculated by the addition of polyethylene glycol 8000 8  wt vol1 and nacl final concentration 02 mol l1 this mixture was stirred for 1 h at 4 c incubated overnight at 4 c and centrifuged at 4200g for 45 min at 4 c the pellet was resuspended in sterile 015 mol l1na2hpo4 solution ph 70 prefilters were placed into a plastic bag with 200 ml beg ph 95 massaged and soaked for 15 min and the eluate poured off and further concentrated as described for the glass wool filter eluates these final concentrated sample volumes fcsv from both the glass wool filter and prefilter were then assayed separately and the results summed to obtain the recovered quantity of test organism

a 20 l negative control unseeded water sample was processed for each trial no background pathogens were detected at any time in the water or soil-amended water samples in addition for each recovery trial an unseeded 20-l water sample was passed through a glass wool filter eluted and the resulting negative eluate then seeded with the same concentration of pathogens as the corresponding water sample pathogens in the seeded negative eluate were enumerated with the same method as the water samples and these values were used as the devisors when calculating percent recovery quantifying the seeded pathogens in a negative eluate takes into consideration differences in pathogen enumeration that could result from matrix differences created by the glass wool filter the importance of this step when quantifying pathogens by qpcr is discussed in lambertini et al 2008 and borchardt et al 2013percent recovery was calculated as the number of genomic copies or cfus of the test organism recovered after filtration of the water sample divided by the number of genomic copies or cfus of the test organism seeded into the eluate of the unseeded water sample multiplied by 100glass wool filters were effective in concentrating pathogens in water with a wide range of turbidity levels mean recovery efficiencies and standard deviations by turbidity level and by pathogen type are reported in table 1 recoveries across the three water matrices ranged from 221 to 727  for the bacteria and 92 to 702  for the viruses bacteria had higher recoveries than the viruses and among the viruses poliovirus had the highest recoveryamong nine independent recovery experiments non-detects ie no recovery were observed for bvdv type 1 and bvdv type 2 once each at 05 ntu turbidity three times for bvdv 1 and twice for bvdv 2 at 215 ntu turbidity and twice for bvdv 2 at 447 ntu turbidity these non-detects were assigned a zero value and included in the mean recovery calculation all other seeded test organisms were recovered every time an experiment was performedpercent recoveries the outcome measure for each pathogen type and turbidity level were tested for normality outliers and homogeneity of variance the tests indicated that the data were not normally distributed outliers were present in the datasets and the datasets have significantly different variances the datasets were transformed using the arcsine trigonometric function to attain normality to fulfill the requirements for conducting a classical analysis of variance anova however even after transformation the same tests showed none of the requirements were metalternatively we applied bootstrapping techniques for conducting the anova mooney and duval 1993 with at least 5000 iterations where recovery percent was the dependent variable and pathogen type and turbidity level were the independent variables table 1 shows the p value for each of the bootstrapping anova tests with the region for rejecting the null hypothesis set at 5  the null hypothesis stated there is no significance difference between the means of percent recoveries for the different pathogen types under the three turbidity levelscomparing within a turbidity level percent recoveries were significantly different among pathogen types at 05 ntu and 215 ntu whereas at the 447 ntu turbidity level the difference in recoveries among pathogens was minor table 1 this suggests when turbidity is high the interaction of soil particles with the filter masks the differences in adsorption and size exclusion characteristics of the pathogens that normally results in differences in filter retentioncomparing within a pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for campylobacter seeded at 500 cfu l1 table 1 p value  00005 for the other pathogens namely bovine coronavirus bovine rotavirus a bvdv type 1 bvdv type 2 e coli o157nm poliovirus and campylobacter seeded at 5 cfu l1 turbidity did not affect recovery as indicated by anova p values of 022 1 056 032 068 037 and 069 respectively it appears that for most of the pathogen types and concentrations tested factors other than turbidity level are more important in determining recovery efficiency by glass wool filtrationaggregating recovery data across turbidity levels and examining all pairwise comparisons between pathogen types percent recoveries differed among virus types and between bacteria and viruses but not between bacterial species table 3 however these comparisons need to be interpreted cautiously because a key limitation of the present study is the quantity of pathogen seeded varied with pathogen type not allowing a clear separation between the effects of seed quantity and pathogen type on percent recovery previously lambertini et al 2008 showed glass wool filter recovery efficiencies did differ among species and serotypes of human enteric viruses but not by the quantity of viruses seeded
among pathogen types poliovirus 579  and e coli o157nm 548  had the greatest recovery efficiency while bvdv-1 156  had the lowest table 3simultaneous concentration of waterborne bacteria and viruses has been previously reported using filtration payment et al 1989 ultrafiltration hill et al 2005 liu et al 2012 and continuous flow ultracentrifugation bisha et al 2011 however these methods often require costly equipment or filters glass wool filters have been used by several groups lambertini et al 2008 environment agency 2000 vilagins et al 1993 to concentrate human enteric viruses from a variety of water sources here we report the use of these filters for concentrating both viral and bacterial pathogens associated with cattle manure from water at turbidity levels simulating agricultural runoff the filters are advantageous in that they are inexpensive highly portable usable in a wide range of water matrices and effective for simultaneous concentration of both bacterial and viral waterborne pathogens they can be constructed to any size depending on volumes to be sampled after disinfection filter housings are reusableglass wool filters however do have limitations as with any virus concentration method that relies on electro-positively charged media for virus adsorption eg 1mds filter cuno inc meriden ct filter effectiveness depends on ambient water ph in our laboratory we have selected ph 75 as the cut-off above which the water ph is adjusted downward by continuously pumping 025 mol l1 hcl into the filter input line during samplingvirus recovery measured in the present study compares favorably with values observed in previous glass wool validation studies with human viruses the average poliovirus recovery rate across the three water matrices was 58  near the ranges of 6277  and 6083  reported by vilagins et al 1993 1997 7091  range noted in the uk environment agency study environment agency 2000 and 17155  reported by lambertini et al 2008 and 3881  range noted by millen et al 2012 the first three previous studies cited adopted working parameters different from those used here such as filtration rate water source and filter dimensions making direct comparison of recovery efficiencies equivocal it is also important that the virus enumeration techniques used were not identical specifically vilagins et al 1993 and the uk environment agency environment agency 2000 used a plaque assay the studies completed by lambertini et al 2008 and millen et al 2012 used the same filtration and virus enumeration techniques as employed hereour recovery data for e coli o157nm and c jejuni as well as the recovery data for salmonella enterica reported in millen et al 2012 demonstrate that the glass wool filtration is an effective for concentrating waterborne bacteria even with c jejuni concentrations as low as five cfu per liter in highly turbid water glass wool filtration recovered about a quarter to a third of the bacteria table 1 payment et al 1989 examined fiberglass filters for the recovery efficiency of clostridium perfringens and legionella pneumophila and found efficiencies were 83 and 55  respectivelyhill et al 2005 tested ultrafiltration for recoveries of e coli enterococcus faecalis s enterica bacillus globigii and found mean recovery efficiencies were from 70 to 93  for all bacterial speciesbisha et al 2011 evaluated modified moore swabs and continuous flow centrifugation for concentrating s enterica and e coli o157h7 liu et al 2012 tested the recovery of c perfringens spores and e coli by ultrafiltration and the recovery efficiencies were greater than 50 having one simple method for concentrating multiple types of waterborne pathogens is advantageous for assessing pathogen levels in water and the associated health risk we demonstrated that inexpensive and easily constructed glass wool filters are effective for concentrating a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in runoff from agricultural fields with applied dairy manure the method is applicable to water quality assessment and source trackingpatients infected with the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and suffering from covid-19 are currently being treated with drug combinations that include oseltamivir1 the authors had previously found that adding oseltamivir to usual primary care for influenza-like illness ili accelerates recovery by about 1 day in those with ili and longer in those with key risk factors in the alic4e study a randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness in primary care2 this effect did not appear to be mediated by influenza virus status as determined by polymerase chain reaction pcr results from nasopharyngeal swabs outcomes for patients found positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 had not been analysed separately given the evolving pandemic this study set out to conduct a post-hoc exploratory analysis of the open-label pragmatic alic4e trial data to explore whether adding oseltamivir to usual primary care for patients with ili who have tested positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 is effective in reducing time to recoverythis was a post-hoc exploratory analysis of data from the alic4e trial an open-label pragmatic randomised controlled trial previously described in full23patients aged 1 year presenting to primary care with ili during three seasonal influenza seasons 15 january 2016 to 12 april 2018 in 15 european countries randomised in the alic4e trial and infected with coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 were eligible for this study ili was defined as a sudden onset of self-reported fever with 1 respiratory symptom cough sore throat running or congested nose and one systemic symptom headache muscle ache sweats or chills or tiredness with symptom duration of 72 hours during a seasonal influenza epidemic4 coronavirus infection was confirmed using the fast track diagnostics respiratory pathogens 21 plus real-time pcr assay on baseline swabs5 an oropharyngeal and nasal swab copan were taken from those aged 16 years and a nasopharyngeal swab copan from those aged 16 years pcr results were not available for clinicians to inform managementparticipants were randomised at the point of care using a remote online electronic data capture system with a 11 ratio between the two armsparticipants were randomised to either usual primary care or usual primary care plus oseltamivir adults and children weighing 40 kg who were randomised to the intervention and able to swallow capsules were given 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days for those aged 13 years oseltamivir was given in oral suspension according to weight 30 mg for those weighing 1015 kg 45 mg for those weighing 1523 kg 60 mg for those weighing 2340 kg and 75 mg for those weighing 40 kga baseline case report form was completed covering overall clinician-rated ili severity duration of symptoms comorbidity temperature pulse individual ili symptom patient-reported severities and usual care advice registered by clinicianpatients were asked to complete a symptom diary for 14 days in order to indicate when they had returned to their usual daily activities and to evaluate fever runningcongested nose sore throat headache cough shortness of breath muscle ache sweatschills diarrhoea nauseavomiting abdominal pain low energytiredness sleeplessness dizziness and feeling generally unwell as no minor moderate or major problem these were supplemented with child-specific questions so that the canadian acute respiratory illness flu scale was completed for children aged 13 years6 patients were contacted via telephone after 24 days 1428 days and 28 days to support study participation diary completion monitor intervention adherence and to ascertain a minimal outcome data setthe primary outcome was patient-reported time to recovery defined as having returned to usual daily activity and fever headache and muscle ache rated as minor or not problematic for non-verbal children clinginess replaced headache and muscle ache when both were unanswered3 where diary data were unavailable data from the 1428 days telephone call were used and if that was unavailable data from the telephone call after 28 days were used where data were incomplete participants were censored at their last contact date or at 28 dayscharacteristics of the participants with coronavirus infection in the two study arms are presented for this exploratory data analysis the authors produced the kaplan meier survival curves for each treatment group and estimated the hazard ratio hr 95 confidence interval ci and associated p-value comparing treatment groups with a cox proportional hazard regression model

their gp 70 contacts versus 57 patients in the oseltamivir group 72 contacts in the first week after inclusion in the second week after inclusion 17 patients in the usual care group contacted their gp 21 contacts versus 14 patients in the oseltamivir group 16 contacts data not shown in the usual care group seven patients visited the hospital in the 4 weeks after inclusion of which one stayed overnight two had an x-ray with one confirmed pneumonia in the oseltamivir group one patient visited the hospital none stayed overnight and none had an x-ray data not shownthis exploratory analysis of the alic4e trial data from 2016 to 2018 suggests that primary care patients with ili who tested positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 and received usual care returned to their usual activities with relevant residual symptoms minor or absent in a median of 5 days mean 635 days patients also receiving oseltamivir returned about 1 day soonerthe present pragmatic open trial design did not allow identification of mechanisms of action or a measure of how much of the observed effect can be attributed specifically to oseltamivir or other possible effects but allows the observed results to likely reflect real world effects in primary care78 it should be noted that this was a primary care study and that the findings cannot be extrapolated to more severely ill andor hospitalised patients in addition though unlikely sars-cov-2 may respond differently to oseltamivirthis studys findings are consistent with other studies showing benefit of oseltamivir in all patients with ili2 and with previous placebo-controlled evidence for adults and children with ili irrespective of infection by influenza or another virus912 previously published possible explanations include that oseltamivirs mode of action may include generalised non-specific mechanisms andor an action on a wider range of viruses10 or that a placebo effect was found in the present study however in the alic4e trial there was no evidence of a differential relative benefit in subgroups such as those with lower illness severity where systematic reviews suggest a more marked placebo response13 in addition the alic4e trials overall estimate of benefit is similar to effects found in placebo-controlled trialssecondary analysis of data from the placebo-controlled trials of oseltamivir in patients with ili not caused by influenza viruses for example by coronaviruses and new placebo-controlled trials in patients with covid-19 could help elucidate a causal effect for its benefit in those patients meanwhile adding oseltamivir to usual primary care appears to accelerate recovery by about 1 day in patients with ili who test positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 and though the present study has not proven that sars-cov-2 responds to oseltamivir this drug could be considered for the management of primary care patients with suspected covid-19the appearance of new viruses with a high epidemic potential is often the result of complex dynamics involving animals humans and the environment coker et al 2011 coronavirus can be considered as a paradigm of this phenomenon in the last 18 years it has caused three new alarming diseases severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the current coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 who 2020a the family of coronaviridae includes strains that infect humans with a wide range of clinical symptoms from those associated with the common cold to potentially lethal respiratory syndromes other coronaviridae strains infect birds and mammals ictv 2012 the high variability of this virus makes cross-infections among species possible potentially leading to spillover chan et al 2015 in fact before the outbreak of the current virus a number of authors addressing the environmental circulation of viruses had already highlighted the potential new pandemic threat posed by coronavirus wigginton and ellenberg 2015

morse et al 2012

santos and monteiro 2013although the main route of transmission of these viruses is via droplets and close contacts the possible environmental spread via water bioaerosols and food should not be neglected in fact the fecal elimination of coronavirus is well-known and has been confirmed for sars-cov yam et al 2003 poon et al 2004 wang et al 2005a petrich et al 2006 he et al 2007 mers cov drosten et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 and sars-cov-2 holshue et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the potential fecal-oral transmission was recently highlighted by yeo et al 2020 moreover possible transmission through bioaerosols from toilet flushing was demonstrated in hong kong for the sars epidemic cluster in amoy gardens watts 2003 yu et al 2004 and was recently suggested for sars-cov-2 ong et al 2020 finally the involvement of fecally-contaminated food in coronavirus transmission is generally not considered but cannot be ruled out given the survival of the human or animal coronavirus on vegetables mullis et al 2013 ypiz-gmez et al 2013at present covid-19 is responsible for a rapidly expanding global epidemic with tens of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths heymann and shindo 2020 di marco et al 2020 as a result a pandemic was declared by who on march 11 2020 who 2020b it is therefore possible that the virus may be released with wastewater and from there contaminate other water bodies surface sea groundwater generating aerosols in fact sewage from hospitals especially infectious disease units may contain the epidemic virus thus requiring efficient disinfection before discharge into natural watersowing to concerns about sars-cov-2 water pollution north korea has recently started to monitor surface waters used as sources of drinking water as recently announced in newspapers by the korean government-funded news agency byung-joon 2020
on yonhap news agency even though other countries are reassuring the public about the safety of drinking water la rosa et al 2020 the problem of water pollution was also addressed in a technical brief of the who on water sanitation hygiene and waste management for covid-19 march 3 2020 this focused on enteric viruses including coronaviruses and indicates that measures used for the non-enveloped enteric virus abatement should be even more efficient for coronavirus who 2020c nevertheless the brief confirms the lack of knowledge regarding coronavirus in waterknowledge of the presence of the coronavirus and more specifically of sars-cov-2 in wastewater along with its survival and removal by different treatment approaches could be very useful for risk assessment and managementin order to define the state of the art regarding coronavirus generally and for epidemic strains in the water environment a literature search was conducted on april 20 2020 using three bibliographic databases pubmed scopus and web of science without time limitations to include even the oldest papers the search was performed with the following keywords coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars mers covid-19 associated with water wastewater sewage slurry sludge and biosolids to give a comprehensive view of the topic the literature search was extended to preprints using the medrxiv server httpswwwmedrxivorg with the same criteria cited above papers were screened in relation to the title and abstract in order to eliminate duplicates and to check whether they complied with the aim of the survey the selected papers were read entirely to collect data on coronavirus type and strain type of water sample type of study experimental or field detection methods monitoring data survival data effect of disinfection and treatmentsthe time span covered by the papers identified by the search extended from 1978 to 2020 however the number of specific papers corresponding to the keywords used was very small only 22 of which 4 papers were preprints from medrxiv these papers are reported and summarized in table 1
with the exception of one study published in 1978 the other papers were published after the sars late 2002early 2003 and mers late 2012 emergencies fig 1
reports the timeline of the reviewed studies divided on the basis of topic nine papers consisted of in vitro studies eleven papers were monitoring studies and two papers included both research aspects the papers were not comparable because they had different purposes and used different methodologiescurrent methods are set up for non-enveloped viruses ie adenovirus norovirus hepatitis a virus which are normally linked to waterborne transmission bosch et al 2008 la rosa et al 2012 coronavirus as well as other enveloped viruses exhibit structural and biochemical properties which suggest that the same methods would not have the same recovery efficiency different methods have therefore been tested on different water samples spiked with different virusestwo papers focused on glass wool filtration methods widely used for non-enveloped viruses which consist in an initial phase of adsorption and elution to positively charged glass wool followed by a second phase of precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 peg abd-elmaksoud et al 2014 blanco et al 2019 abd-elmaksoud et al 2014 analysed 20 l of dechlorinated tap water with different turbidities spiked with bcov detected with pcr they found highly variable virus recovery rates 181  201 results from the samples with low turbidity reported the highest recovery efficiency 258  213 blanco et al 2019 optimized the glass wool filtration method using 50 l of surface waters spiked with tgev detected with cell cultures by raising the ph of the buffer eluent to 110 at 95 for non-enveloped viruses by increasing the contact time from 10 to 20 min and using a 20 concentration of peg instead of 10 the virus recovery thus improved from 040 to 51  14 although both studies used the same method the results are not directly comparable because the studies differed in terms of coronavirus strain type and volume of water samples quantity of virus seeded and detection method
wang et al 2005c evaluated a virus concentration method based on the adsorption on electropositive filter media particle columns elution with broth at ph 72 and precipitation by 10 peg they analysed 100-ml of sewage spiked with sars-cov and phage f2 detected with cultural methods and obtained a much higher recovery efficiency for phage f2 on average 1271 ranging from 336 to 2600 than for sars-cov 102 ranging from 0 to 214
ye et al 2016 applied a two-step method to wastewater samples based on a preliminary centrifugation aimed at removing solid particles and then ultrafiltration on the liquid fraction both solid and liquid parts were analysed with cultural methods small wastewater samples 30-ml were spiked with mhv and phage 6 both enveloped and with phages ms2 and t3 non-enveloped and the method was optimized for both fractions to increase the recovery rates of the enveloped viruses they achieved mean recovery rates of 251 for mhv 182 for 6 556 for ms2 and 855 for t3 thus confirming the lower efficiency of the concentration methods for enveloped viruses in addition although up to 26 of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction compared to 6 of the two non-enveloped ones only 37 of mhv and 2 of ms2 were recovered from ita completely different approach was followed by fan et al 2010 who tested the efficiency of a methodology for virus detection based on surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy sers coupled with statistical analysis methods to interpret the sers spectral pattern they used deionized water spiked with mhv with a very high final concentration 106-107 pfuml the results demonstrated that this methodology was able to differentiate viruses at the strain level however its real usefulness for rapid detection and identification of viruses in environmental water samples was questionable owing to the low sensitivitythe small numbers of studies on the detection methods for coronavirus and surrogates in water is likely motivated by the assumption that they are not considered to be waterborne although the results of these studies are not directly comparable they indicate that methods normally used for non-enveloped viruses need to be improved for enveloped viruses and that in any case they have a lower efficiencyin the survival studies a variable persistence of viruses was identified depending on the type of virus type of water sample and temperature duan et al 2003 found a reduction in sars-cov infectivity up to an undetectable level after 34 days at room temperature in 300-l of sterilized water initially containing a viral titer of 106 tcid50 the persistence of infective sars-cov was reduced in 2 day at 20 c in all the water types tested by wang et al 2005b namely hospital wastewater domestic sewage and tap water but at 4 c it increased to 14 days which was the duration of the entire study period over a 21-day study period gundy et al 2009 compared the survival of hcov-229e and fivp with that of poliovirus 1 in filtered unfiltered tap water and wastewater in tap water coronavirus showed a 3 log10 decrease in 10 days at 23 c and over a longer period estimated 100 days at 4 c in addition fivp inactivation at 4 c was faster compared to hcov-229e in wastewater only at 23 c both coronaviruses survived for a shorter period 24 days poliovirus survived longer than coronaviruses in all tested water samples at 23 c similar to 4 c in tap waterother studies showed a prolonged survival of animal coronavirus and surrogates in different water matrices casanova et al 2009 reported a 2 log10 decline in tgev and mhv infectivity after more than 15 days in reagent-grade water at 25 c the survival was strongly prolonged at 4 c over 49 days no reduction was observed both in reagent-grade and lake water for mhv whilst a 1 log10 reduction after 14 days was observed in lake water for tgev this study also demonstrated a faster decline in infectivity in wastewater in particular a 2 log10 reduction was observed after nine and seven days for tgev and mhv respectively in pasteurized sewage at 2325 c room temperature and 2 log10 and 1 log10 reductions after 35 days at 4 c in a later work casanova and weaver 2015 found a 2 log10 reduction of phage 6 after five days in pasteurized raw sewage at 22 c but with nonlinear inactivation kinetics studying mhv and phage 6 in raw sewage ye et al 2016 compared the virus survival in pasteurized and unpasteurized wastewater while in pasteurized sewage they found a 2 log10 reduction at 25 c after 3040 h for mhv and 50 h for phage 6 in the unpasteurized samples the inactivation time was reduced to 13 and 7 h respectively indicating the possible role of other microorganisms bacteria and protozoa in the viral inactivation the reduction in the enveloped viruses was significantly slower in wastewater at 10 c compared to 25 c in the same study phages ms2 and t3 non-enveloped survived longer in all conditions and matricesalthough these studies are fragmentary and not directly comparable they indicate that human coronavirus and surrogates are less resistant than non-enveloped viruses in water environments that their survival is generally reduced in waters with organic and microbial pollution and that viral inactivation increases with increasing temperaturesseveral studies have considered the efficacy of disinfection treatments against sars-cov and surrogates on surfaces kampf et al 2020 however water disinfection was only addressed by wang et al 2005b who analysed the resistance to different chlorine solutions of sars-cov and phage f2 seeded into 100-ml domestic sewage during a 30 min disinfection assay sars-cov was completely inactivated with 10 mgl chlorine or 20 mgl chlorine dioxide while phage f2 needed a higher chlorine concentration 40 mgl and was not completely inactivated even by 40 mgl chlorine dioxide
christensen and myrmel 2018 tested the virus removal efficiency at the bench scale of a coagulation-filtration system previously optimized using three different coagulants zirconium chitosan and polyaluminium chloride in reducing bcov and other viruses hepatis a virus bovine norovirus and ms2 diluted and undiluted water samples 400-ml from water treatment plants were spiked with viral mixtures after the addition of coagulants centrifugation and filtration steps the supernatant and filtrate were analysed for quantification a combination of flocculation and filtration led to a decline in viral presence from 10 to 70 depending on the type of virus coagulant and presence of natural organic matter bcov was reduced more mean 4 log10 in undiluted water by all the three coagulants than in diluted water in this last example chitosan performed the bestas of 2019 a total of seven studies had monitored the presence of coronavirus sars and animal in water sewage slurry or biosolids generally as part of a wider project overall their findings are heterogeneous in terms of the goals of the study matrices and detection methods
derbyshire and brown 1978 analysed different environmental matrices impacted by breeding activities for a total of 158 samples collected from surface runoff surface waters and groundwaters 20-l each as well as slurry from pig and cattle sources 2-l each the study used different virus concentration methods based on the type of environmental matrices and seeded the eluates on primary cell cultures from slurry samples 56 the study found 25 porcine enteroviruses three adenovirus and one coronavirus the analysis of water samples 102 revealed the presence of only three porcine enteroviruses and one bovine enterovirus however no coronavirus was found
wang et al 2005c analysed a total of 20 sewage samples before 25-l and after 25-l disinfection by chlorine from hospitals receiving sars patients samples were concentrated by electropositive filter media particle the virus recovery was also assessed in the same study see section 32 and the eluates were then analysed for sars-cov using both cell culture and rt-pcr all samples were negative for infectious sars-cov however the genome was detected in all samples before disinfection 100 and in three samples after disinfection 15
schwarte et al 2011 studied the impact of grazing animals on the microbial and chemical-physical water quality of pasture streams using different simulated scenarios in a rural area bcov together with bovine enterovirus and bovine rotavirus were measured from simulated runoff 360 samples and cow feces 90 samples as viruses are commonly shed by grazing animals the pathogen load was analysed using multiplex rt-qpcr however the procedure for sample concentration was not described bovine enterovirus was detected both in cow feces 243 and in the runoff samples ranging from 83 to 167 while bovine coronavirus was only present in one feces sample 11 bovine rotavirus was not detected in any of the samples
bibby et al 2011 2013 characterized viral pathogens in sewage sludge through metagenomic analysis the entire genome extracted was sequenced by shotgun pyrosequencing in their two studies they followed different procedures for virus recovery from sludge but in both cases they found that coronaviruses were the most abundant human viruses occurring in over 80 of samples bibby and peccia 2013 the human coronavirus strains 229e and hku1 were identified both studies produced a list of the most abundant viruses which could be extremely useful in quantitative pathogen monitoring
corsi et al 2014 collected samples from three streams in the usa running through an area with rural and urban land use they used an automated large-volume sample collection and virus concentration system based on pre-filtration and glass-wool filter the virus eluates were then analysed using rt-qpcr for bcov and various other viruses around 20-l composite samples were obtained mixing 5-l subsamples collected over time by the system in two different conditions low-flow period and during runoff events for a total of 63 samples the eluates were analysed using rt-qpcr to measure both human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus genogroups i and ii hepatitis a virus and rotavirus and bovine adenovirus enterovirus rotavirus group a polyomavirus coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus types 1 and 2 enteric viruses during the study period all the human viruses were detected in the samples as well as numerous animal and bovine viruses except bcovin the most recent study blanco et al 2019 concentrated 10-l samples of surface waters by an optimized glass wool filtration method see section 31 and used a semi-nested rt-pcr for wild-type alphabeta cov followed by sequencing they analysed a total of 21 samples and found only one positive result for alphacoronavirus which was related to a novel rodentshrew-specific clade by the sequence analysisin the studies conducted until 2019 field investigations also confirmed the scarcity of data on coronavirus in water coronaviruses were rarely searched for and more rarely found although the lack of positive results could derive from the low recovery efficiency of the methods used as shown above however in the early months of 2020 six field studies focused on a sars-cov-2 search in wastewater samples owing to the increasing focus on the environmental circulation of the new coronavirusin australia ahmed et al 2020 collected 100200 ml of sewage nine samples concentrated them with two different methods filtration by electronegative membranes and ultrafiltration and analysed the concentrates with rt-qpcr using with two different primer-probe sets for nucleocapsid protein gene the authors obtained one positivity for each concentration method not the same sample but with only one set of primers and at very low titers 12 and 19 genomic copies100 ml in china wang et al 2020 sampled the wastewater of a hospital at various stages of a multi-stage disinfection with sodium hypochlorite five samples three before disinfection and one for each of the disinfection stages were analysed with rt-qpcr and a culture assay the samples from the inlet and after the first disinfection stage were positive the sample after disinfection was negative all were non infectivethe four other monitoring studies on this topic were retrieved from medrxiv as preliminary reports which had not yet been peer-reviewed in the netherlands medema et al 2020 monitored sewage samples and obtained positive signals only in 14 778 of the 18 samples collected after the occurrence of the first cases of covid-19 in the usa massachusetts wu et al 2020 collected 10 samples from wwtps after the first known cases of covid-19 and detected sars-cov-2 in all of them with approximately 100 genomic copiesml the same result was obtained after the storage of samples at 4 c for 24 h and for a week again in the usa montana nemudryi et al 2020 collected seven samples of raw sewage which tested positive for sars-cov-2 with a viral load from 100 to 2000 genomic copiesl in france wurtzer et al 2020 collected both raw and treated wastewater from urban wwtp 31 samples obtaining 100 and 75 positivity respectively with a 2 log10 reduction after treatmentoverall these recent studies confirm the lack of standardized concentration methods for enveloped viruses see table 1 and the need to use the same method in order to be able to compare results from different studiesconcerns about possible secondary transmission of the novel sars-cov-2 via water are growing with the evidence of its fecal elimination moreover the results of in vitro experiments of prolonged virus survival with declining temperatures suggest that coronavirus excreted in feces could reach wastewater treatment plants in an infective state especially in cool climates however current knowledge is very scarce and fragmentary prior to covid-19 interest in this topic was very low owing to the common belief that enveloped viruses cannot survive for extended periods in water however the assumption that sars-cov-2 is not involved in environmental circulation cannot be accepted without better knowledge as highlighted by the detection of sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater by six different global research groupsthe ongoing sars-cov-2 emergency and its rapid spread demands new attention on its detection in water the scarcity of information on the presence and persistence of coronavirus in the environment merits urgent researchin the meantime we should respond to the ongoing pandemic by taking precautions and assume that there is a potential for secondary transmission in particular we believe that research should address the followingset up efficient methods to concentrate and detect enveloped viruses and coronavirus in particular from water matricesevaluate the survival of these viruses in natural conditions at different temperatures and in different types of waterassess the efficiency of water treatments and disinfection to avoid contamination from urban and hospital wastewaterevaluate the implications for water reuse for agriculture including the possibility of food raw vegetables contaminationestablish a surveillance system through sewage monitoring of the potential virus circulation
the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperto face sars-cov-2 pandemic various attempts are made to identify potential effective treatments by repurposing available drugs among these treatments indomethacin indo a potent anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug acting on cox12 enzymes developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the 1960s 1 2 seems to have the potential to become an effective treatment for the patients infected with sars cov-2 indo can be used not only for its antipyretic properties common to other non-steroidal analgesic drugs as symptomatic treatment 3 4 but also to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 5 6 and to robustly reduce proinflammatory interleukin-6 levels 7 8following single oral immediate-release ir doses of 25 mg or 50 mg indo is readily absorbed attaining peak plasma concentrations at about 2 h post-dose orally administered indo ir is almost completely bioavailable with 90 of the dose absorbed within 4 h indo sustained-release sr 75 mg is designed to release 25 mg of the drug initially and the remaining 50 mg over approximately 12 h 90 of dose absorbed by 12 h indo is highly bound to protein in plasma about 99 over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations and it has been found to cross the bloodbrain barrier and the placenta and appears in breast milk indo exists in plasma as parent drug and its desmethyl desbenzoyl and desmethyldesbenzoyl metabolites all in the unconjugated form indo is eliminated via renal excretion metabolism and biliary excretion with a mean half-life of about 45 hthe following dosage regimens are recommended in the fda label for the different indications of indo ir 9 indo 25 mg twice a day or three times a day if this is well tolerated increase the daily dosage by 25 mg or by 50 mg until a total daily dose of 150200 mg in 3 or 4 divided doses is reachedindo sr 10 75 mg once a day can be substituted for indo ir capsules 25 mg three times a day however there will be significant differences between the two dosage regimens in indo blood levels especially after 12 h in addition indo sr 75 mg twice a day can be substituted for indo ir capsules 50 mg three times a dayin 2006 indo has been shown to have antiviral properties against coronaviruses including human sars-cov-1 and canine coronavirus ccov 11 the study conducted in dogs identified indo as a potent inhibitor of coronavirus replication and suggested that having both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities indo could be beneficial in sars therapy in this study the in-vivo antiviral efficacy was determined by evaluating virus titres in ccov-infected dogs treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight the therapeutic dose in human 12 and dog 13 this dosage regimen was associated with a dramatic decrease in virus titres in the feces of the treated animals for 4 daysthe antiviral activity of indo was shown to be associated with the activation of the doublestranded rna dsrnadependent protein kinase r pkr indo at concentrations in the low micromolar range activates pkr leading to an interferon and dsrnaindependent phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor2 subunit 14 shutting off viral protein translation and blocking viral replication 15 a recent study conducted in-vitro and in ccov infected dogs showed that indo has also a direct and potent antiviral activity against the sars cov-2 pseudovirus 16 in this study the rate of recovery in ccov-infected dogs treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight was also evaluated these new data indicated that indo has a potency comparable to the potency of hydroxychloroquine hcq 17 and remdesivir 18 and that indo could be a very effective potential treatment of patients affected by the sars cov-2it is important to note that in april 2020 an open-label single-arm phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral hcq indo and azithromycin in subjects positive with sars-cov-2 with mild symptoms was started this study was posted in clinicaltrialsgov with reference nct04344457 19 this study expected to include 80 subjects will assess the improvement of sars-cov-2 disease status as measured by time days required to improve the clinical status from mild to symptom-free using oral hcq 200 mg twice a day bid for 5 days oral indomethacin 50 mg three times a day tid for 14 days and oral azithromycin 500 mg once a day qd for 3 days overall these data suggest that indo could exert both anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects for the treatment of patients infected with sars-cov-2the objective of the present paper was to apply a meta-analytic model-based approach using published data to estimate the relationship between indo exposure and response in dogs after administration of an ir formulation and to extrapolate this relationship to humans after ir and sr formulations the exposureresponse model will be used for predicting the most effective dosage regimen of indo suitable for maximizing the potential clinical benefit for the treatment of patients infected by the sars-cov-2 coronavirusindo was shown to inhibit sars cov-1 virus replication with an inhibitory concentration 50 ic50 of about 5 m ie 179 mgl while aspirin was ineffective 11 in a more recent study indo was shown to inhibit sars cov-2 pseudovirus replication 16 in this recent study the pseudovirus model that contains the sars-cov-2 spike was used sars cov-2 genbank mn9089473 briefly african green monkey kidney vero e6 cells were infected with sars cov-2 pseudovirus and treated with different concentrations of indo 0 01 1 5 10 50 100 500 m or aspirin 0 01 1 5 10 50 100 500 m as control at 48 h post infection the level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity in the cell lysates of infected cells at 48 h post-infection pi indo was found to possess a remarkable antiviral activity reducing viral particle production dose-dependently with an ic50 of  1 m ie 0358 mgl and selective index of 500 and caused a dramatic reduction relative light unit to zero at 48 h pi in vero e6 cells 16two different studies were conducted to evaluate whether indo could be effective in vivo in the first study 11 the in-vivo antiviral efficacy of indo was assessed by evaluating the ccov viral load in infected dogs treated with indo dogs were tested for the presence of ccov rna in feces by a real-time rt-pcr assay and ccov antibodies in serum samples by an elisa test dogs were treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight daily for 4 days starting on day 4 pi whereas dogs in a separate group served as infected non-treated controls in indo-treated dogs viral rna titres in the feces decreased rapidly after starting treatment reaching minimal levels at day 7 pi in concomitance with the peak observed in non-treated dogs indo antiviral effect was reversed upon suspension of treatment demonstrating a potent anti-coronavirus activity of indo in vivoin the second study 16 the  of recovery in ccov-infected dogs treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight was evaluated dogs treated with ribavirin a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with efficacy against rna and dna viruses were used as a control group the enrolled dogs were confirmed for diagnosis of ccov infection with a canine coronavirus test kit and between 23 days of the onset of symptoms the time of recovery was determined by the disappearance of symptoms and a negative diagnosis by the canine coronavirus test kit 20 in indo-treated dogs a complete recovery was observed after 5 days of treatmentthe rate of recovery and the viral load inhibition in ccov-infected dogs were expressed in  ranging from 0  recovery at baseline or full viral inhibition to 100 full recovery or baseline viral load the rate of recovery and the viral load inhibition were modeled as a function of time with the assumption that the effect was driven by the constant indo exposure maintained for 5 days the following weibull models were used1documentclass12ptminimal

0333 0667 1 15 24 6 8 10 and 12 h after administration of uncoated pellets 21human indo ir pk was evaluated at single doses of 25 mg 50 mg and 75 mg in 8 healthy volunteers and 100 mg in 4 healthy

subjects and patients 22the indo sr at the dose of 75 mg is a formulation designed to ir 25 mg and to provide a delayed release of the remaining 50 mg of the dose pk samples collected at intervals for up to 12 h in 14 subjects were used for the assessment of the pk characteristics of indo sr 23the mean concentrations time course of indo in dog and human were obtained by digitizing the concentration versus time graphs reported in the referred publicationsindo is a weak organic acid with a molecular weight of 3578 gmol that is 99 bound in dog and human to plasma albumin but not to red blood cells 24 data from in vitro plasma protein binding experiments are frequently used to guide the estimate of in vivo efficacy in the assumption that the efficacy is driven by the free unbound drug concentration 25 as the protein binding in human and dog was the same ie 99 the free fraction was also the same as a consequence the translational model was based on total indo concentrationstwo simulation scenarios were considered assuming that the effective indo concentration in human was driven by the in-vitro potency associated with 1 50 of the inhibition effect ic50 and 2 95 of the inhibition effect ic95the estimated effective antiviral concentration in human is usually defined as the indo concentration at which virus replication is inhibited by 50 ie the ic50 value however a more aggressive and more clinically appropriate target such as ic90 was proposed for any repurposed drug against sars-cov-2 26 therefore as recommended for other antiviral treatments two target inhibitory concentrations were retained ic50 corresponding to an exposure of 0358 mgl and ic95 corresponding to an exposure of 1074 mgl 27the time during which indo concentration remains above the effective concentration was used as a driver of the response as commonly done for the assessment of the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents 28 three

predictions the estimated parameters are presented in table 1 the weibull models properly described the  of recovery and viral load data the estimated td parameters indicated that after one day of treatment indo was able to inhibit 63 of the viral load while 63 of recovery was expected after 23 days of treatment all the pk analyses were conducted on the mean concentration time course values of indo in dogs and humans the pk observations were obtained by digitizing the concentration versus time graphs reported in the referred publicationsthe indo pk in dog and human was well described by a two-compartment model with first order distribution and elimination processes the absorption was characterized by a lag-time in human and dog by a zero-order drug release for the ir formulation and by a first-order process for the sr formulation the residual error was described by a combined additive and proportional error model the estimated pk parameters in dog after an ir formulation and in human after ir and sr formulations are presented in table 2 the precision of all pk parameters presented in table 2 was  0001 the relative high precision of the estimated parameters was probably due to the use of the mean data in the fitting procedure to the limited number of observations with respect to the number of parameters in the model and to the limited variability on the datathe maximal concentration was reached between 1 h and 15 h post-dose in dog and in human with the ir formulation and between 2 h and 25 h post-dose in human with the sr formulation indo is rapidly distributed and eliminated the fraction of the dose estimated as the fraction of the total auc cleared from the systemic circulation in the initial 6 h post-dose is 90 in dog 84 in human with the ir formulation and 12 in human with the sr formulation the corresponding indo half-life in the initial 6 h was estimated  3 h for the sr formulation  15 h for the ir formulation in human and  1 h in dog the observed and model-predicted indo concentrations and the 95 prediction intervals for the mean profile are presented in supplemental material sfigs 1 2 and 3 in dog at the dose of 25 mg in human at the dose 25 mg to 100 mg ir and in human at the dose of 75 mg er respectively the 95 prediction intervals for the mean profile were computed by simulating the model outcomes using the estimated parameters and the estimated residual error 200 replicates of the original dataset were simulated based on the final model and 95 prediction intervals for the mean profile were computed based on the simulated datasetsno accumulation was expected in dog after repeated indo daily administration due to the very short half-life the simulated indo exposure at 1 mgkgday equivalent to 85 mgday due to an average weight of 85 kg of the treated dogs in the ccov infected dogs after 4 days of treatment is presented in fig 3 this simulation indicated that identical levels of indo with large peak-to-trough ratio were expected on each day of treatmentthe estimated plasma concentration in dog following an indo daily dose of 1 mgkg indicated a lack of accumulation due to the very short half-life of indo these data thus supported the hypothesis that the observed efficacy was not due to an accumulated exposure but to the time during which the exposure was above an effective value the effective exposure initially defined as an exposure greater or equal to the ic50 value was estimated to 0358 mgl considering a molecular weight of indo of 3578 gmol and an ic50 of 1 m the estimated time during which the exposure was above 0358 mgl was 25 hdaytwo parameters were used to characterize the  of recovery td representing the time-to-response ie the time necessary for  63 of the total response and g the shape of the curve the time during which the indo concentration remains above the effective concentration was assumed to affect the time-to-response the shape of the time-to-response curve was assumed invariant with respect to the indo exposure according to eq 1 two extreme scenarios can be considered to characterize the response 1 a time during which the indo concentration remains above the effective concentration equal to zero associated with a td  0 leading to a flat zero response and 2 a very large td value associated with an indo concentration always above the effective concentration 24 h a day leading to a flat 100 response any intermediate time during which the indo concentration remains above the effective concentration was associated with a td value providing a graded response as pictorially represented in fig 4a proportionality rule was used as a straightforward method for estimating the adjusted td in human as a function of the estimated time during which the indo concentration was expected to remain above the effective concentration the proportionality rule was based on the following consideration a larger exposure was associated with a larger effective exposure and the size of the response was proportional to the level of the effective exposurethe expected recovery  in human was estimated using the recovery  in dog see table 1 with a td value adjusted for the estimated time during which the exposure in human was above the effective exposure value the adjustment was done by assuming that larger values of td were associated with short time during which the daily exposure was above the effective exposure using a proportionality ruledifferent values of the effective exposure were estimated according to the different dosage regimens and different values of the target in-vitro potency the indo exposure simulated after different dosage regimens of the ir and the sr formulations during 6 days of treatment are presented in the supplemental material sfigs 47the effective exposure was estimated during 6 days of treatment as the pre-clinical data indicated that a complete response was observed in the initial 5 days of treatmenta complete response was defined as the complete 100 disappearance of the symptoms the estimated times above the effective exposure by dosage regimen are presented in table 3 as a function of the target potency associated with the ic50 and ic95 values the effective exposure for the ir formulation was the same on each day of treatment due to the lack of accumulation differently from the values of the sr formulation the repeated administration of the sr formulation was associated with increased exposure leading to an increase of the effective exposure value with timethe adjusted td values by dosage regimen are presented in table 4 as a function of the target potency associated with the ic50 and ic95 values a lower td value was associated with an earlier onset of response therefore the best performing dosage was 75 mg sr formulation bid and the worst dosage was 25 mg ir formulation tidthe expected  of recovery in human by dosage regimen are presented in fig 4 as a function of the target potency associated with the ic50 and ic95 values the simulated  of recovery in human was always faster than the one observed in animal this because the time above the effective exposure in human  27 hday in the worst-case scenario for 25 mg ir tid was always larger than the time above the effective exposure in dog  25 hdaythe aim of this study was not to prove the efficacy of indo for the treatment of sars-cov-2 but to show that indo could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of patients infected with the sars-cov-2 virus based on the evidence derived from studies conducted in-vitro in animals and on the model-based simulationsthe food and drug administration fda approved indo in 1965 under the brand name indocin indo is approved to treat moderate to severe osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis today several drug manufacturers make generic versions of the drug indo was also found to have significant anticancer activity against a wide variety of cancer cell types in vitro and in vivo 30 31 indo performs its anticancer activity in different fashions inhibits proliferation via induction of apoptotic death of tumor cells 29 31 reduces tumorigenesis by enhancing the immune response 32 33 and inhibiting the angiogenesis 34 as well recently extensive studies on various cancer cell types including colorectal carcinoma justified the efficacy of indo to reduce the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and progressive cell proliferation 35 36coronavirus is an envelope virus with four structural proteins spike s protein membrane m protein envelope e protein and nucleocapsid n protein 37 s protein is responsible for the virus attachment and entry to the target cells which initiate the infection process s protein plays key roles in the induction of protective humoral and cellular immunity during sars-cov this is the reason why the pseudovirus model that contains the sars-cov-2 spike was considered as the most attractive target for sars-cov vaccine and therapeutic development 38 39in-vitro indo was found to be active against several viruses including sars-cov-1 virus and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus 11 16 this antiviral activity was also shown in ccov and in several other rna-viruses suggesting a cellular rather than a viral target for the drug 11 16the in-vitro results presented in this paper indicated that indo is active in the human sars-cov-2 pseudovirus at low micromolar range that a good correlation exists between viral load and rate of response in ccov infected dogs that indo has a similar in-vitro inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 pseudovirus and ccov and that a good expectation exists for the human performance of indo in the treatment of patients infected with sars-cov-2a meta-analysis recently conducted on 9 studies including laboratory-confirmed 1426 patients affected by sars-cov-2 suggests that there were mild or severe cytokine storm in severe patients which was an important cause of death therefore the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients interleukin-6 il-6 plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome if a drug can block the signal transduction pathway of il-6 it is expected to become a new treatment of severe patients 40to explore the role of il-6 in the sars-cov-2 infection the corimuno-toci trial was conducted using tocilizumab clinicaltrialsgov reference nct04331808 tocilizumab is a blocker of il-6r which can effectively block il-6 signal transduction pathway 41 42 the results of this study have yet to be published but the outcomes were reported in a press release it included patients who were hospitalized with sars-cov-2 moderate to severe pneumonia in intensive care or at high risk of requiring intensive care but did not need resuscitation upon admission the study included 129 patients who were randomized to either usual treatment plus tocilizumab n  65 or usual treatment alone n  64one of the interesting pharmacological effects of indo is its modulation of cytokine production 43 and its robustly effect on the reduction of proinflammatory il-6 as shown in a study conducted in mice where a decrease of 75 to 80 of il-6 has been observed 44 this feature in combination with the antiviral properties of indo on human sars-cov-1 canine ccov and sars-cov-2 11 16 further highlight how indo could be used to potentially aid the fight against the coronavirusdifferent simulations were conducted to evaluate the expected performances of different dosage regimens using the time during which the indo exposure remains above the effective concentration as a criterion for assessing efficacytwo thresholds for the effective indo concentration were considered the first one best case scenario was associated with the concentration at which pseudovirus replication is inhibited by 50 ie 0358 mgl and the second one worst case scenario associated with the concentration at which virus replication is inhibited by 95 ie 1074 mglthe results of the analysis indicated that the 75 mg sr bid dosage regimen was expected to deliver an improved clinical benefit given the larger timeday during which the exposure was expected to remain above the effective concentration following this dosage regimenthe doses used in the simulations were selected based on the recommended dosage regimen of indo reported in the label for the ir 9 and the sr formulations 10 the recommended dosage for the ir formulation is 25 mg bid or tid if this is well tolerated the daily dosage can be increased by 25 mg or by 50 mg but the total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg indo sr 75 mg once a day can be substituted for indo ir capsules 25 mg three times a day and indo sr 75 mg bid can be substituted for indo ir 50 mg three times a dayamong the limitations that could affect the assessment of the indo effectthe in-vitro test showed that indo had a directly and potently antiviral activity against the sars cov-2 pseudovirus and not on the sars cov-2 virus the pseudovirus model that contains the sars-cov-2 spike was used to study the sreceptor interactions and this test is not necessarily indicative of an effect on virus replicationthe assumption that the broad range effects on coronaviruses eg sars-cov-1 ccov and sars-cov-2 can be used to predict the indo efficacy in the treatment of sars-cov-2the assumption that indo inhibits viral replication of human sars-cov-2 at the same concentration that inhibits ccovthere are no deep pools of the virus and what is in the blood reflects what is in the targetthe assumption that the time above the effective concentration is the driver of the efficacythe limited number of dogs used to assess viral load and efficacy in animal studiesthe use of the proportionality criterion in the translational model for estimating the clinical response in humanthe limitations of the present analyses mainly concern the reliability and the predictive performances of the outcomes of the animal and in-vitro studies the relevance of these studies mainly concerns the proof of mechanism of new candidate drugs these studies provide only indicative information on the potential performances of new treatments in controlled clinical trials as shown by the outcomes of recent clinical trials on hcq and remdesivir 4547 two drugs with an in-vitro potency very closed to the in-vitro potency of indo 17 18the pharmacological properties of indo suggest that indo could exert both anti-inflammatory reduction of proinflammatory il-6 and antiviral effects when used for treating patients infected with sars-cov-2 the analyses presented in this paper suggest that indo treatment with the sr formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment of patients infected by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus these results suggest that indo could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of sars-cov-2 whose potential therapeutic effect needs to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trialas very recent studies conducted on remdesivir and hcq two among the most promising treatments failed to demonstrate efficacy in patients hospitalized for a documented sars-cov-2 pneumonia 4547 the findings of the present analysis could be considered as particularly critical for defining new approaches for the battle against this major endemic diseasethe early pneumonia cases were identified in december 2019 with unclear origin
1
 the novel coronavirus has been named by the world health organization as coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 which shares similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2
 especially older people and individuals with coexisting diseases are particularly susceptible to covid19 and are more commonly seen in patients with severe diseases
1
 now the covid19 has spread to many countries over the past 2 months and become a serious threat to public health worldwideto impede the outbreak of covid19 series of precautionary measures nationwide have been taken such as activation of emergency response system quarantine isolating suspicious cases community surveillance and epidemiological investigations
3
 as a result the transmission of covid19 in china has been effectively blocked however the occurrence of asymptomatic patients asp has posed a novel challenge regarding the epidemic of covid19
1
 
4
 asp are not quarantined but also have considerable infectivity
5
 the viral loads in asp were quantitatively similar to those identified in patients with symptoms
5
 meanwhile the asp have not been diagnosed as the laboratoryconfirmed cases
6
 therefore imported cases and asp have become novel challenges in chinamodelingbased work may provide critical insight into the impact of interventions and epidemic of covid19
7
 recently many models have been developed to estimation the epidemic trend and evaluate the effect of controlled interventions

 however the epidemic data have been updated and the number of laboratoryconfirmed cases fall to zero on march 20 at several provinces in china therefore novel datadriven model should be reconstructed to better characterize the epidemic features of covid19in current work we developed a refined model with two novel features we considered the effect of maximum capacity in healthcare facility on the recovery rate of infected cases meanwhile we also incorporated the asp into our model these two features significantly improved the model fitting under strongly controlled measures asp or imported cases would not lead to a concomitant outbreak however if the average effective contact rate within population was increased our model could predict a second outbreak with only a few asymptomatic or imported patients meanwhile the asp will accelerate the epidemic outbreak of covid19 with reduced latent period and larger outbreak size compared with imported patients our model may provide guidance for formulating controlled measures and reevaluation of the diagnostic criteria for covid19jiangsu and anhui are two provinces adjacent to wuhan hubei province in china we collected the number of confirmed and cured patients from 23 january to 31 march on the official website for commission of health of jiangsu and anhui provinces
15
 
16
 the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces respectively the data were collected from national bureau of statistics httpwwwstatsgovcn we obtained that the initial susceptible population at jiangsu and anhui provinces 2019 was 807 and 63659 million respectivelyowing to the epidemiological features of covid19 and declaration of public health emergency in jiangsu and anhui provinces immediately following the closure of wuhan on 23 january 2020 interventions such as isolation precaution and quarantine have been implemented therefore the migration of population was cutdown and we did not consider wuhan returnees since 23 january as previously described
17
 
18
 the effect of wuhan returnees after 23 january was discussed in supporting information discussion 11 to simplify model construction we divided the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces into five variables termed as susceptible population with no resistance to disease s closely observed population c including the individuals under public health intervention or people with potentially close contacts infected patients i recovered r cureddead and asp a the total infected population i was of interest for monitoring the epidemic of covid19 the complete model was formulated as follows

 describes the average recovery rate for infected patients since the healthcare facilityworkers in the hospital has maximum capacity a reasonable assumption argues that higher number of inpatients or quarantined cases will lower the recovery rate as the number of infected cases decreased the clinical care and treatments may be improved these concerns may lead to threshold behavior in recovery rate we used a hill function to depict the dependence of  on asymptomatic to diagnosed patients in which k denotes the threshold and n is the cooperativitythe initial values of susceptible population s were set to be the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces as described above the initial value for i and r commission of health in jiangsu and anhui provinces r  0

 the initial values of close contacts and asp were estimatedthe simplified version of the model without the effect of asp and healthcare capacity related recovery rate is described by following equations

a more complex mutant model without the effect of asp was described by following equations

the parameter estimation was performed using the potterswheel
22
 the trust region method was adopted during simulation initial values of s i and r were fixed other parameters and initial conditions were allowed to vary with lognormal distributions a fit sequence with at least 400 stochastic runs was implemented to exclude the potential local minima in parametric space the basic 
2 criteria was used for model identification 
2n  1 where n denotes the number of data points

local sensitivity analysis provides dynamic responses to an infinitesimal disturbance in kinetic parameters and initial conditions a dynamic system can be defined by xf x  where x and  donate state and parameter vector respectively relative sensitivity s is defined as
simaximaxlnimaxln
note that this sensitivity coefficient is only locally valid in parameter spacethe ordinary differential equations were integrated using ode23s solver in matlab r2018bwe first formulated a simplified model similar to the seir model 
23
 which captured the major interactions among susceptible population close contacts infected patients and recovered cases model 2 with reasonable guess for parameter values we performed model fitting to reported data from jiangsu province
15
 a total of 400 stochastic runs were performed however the best fit from 400 runs did not satisfy the basic criteria for a convincible model 
2n  1 for both infected and recovered population figure s1a a speculation argued that the actual recovery was slower than model predictions at early time points figure s1a right notably the temporal recovery exhibited a moderate cooperativity with a hill coefficient 4857 95 confidence interval 47 5014 implying that the recovery rate  might be dynamically adjusted since the number of healthcare facilityworkers in hospital might affect the maximally admitted inpatients and medical treatment we modified the recovery rate  by multiplying a scaling factor model 3 we assumed that higher infectedquarantined cases may lower the recovery rate the cooperativity was also subject to model fitting results suggested that the 
2 penalty from model fitting was significantly decreased figure s1b however the model could not faithfully match the infected numbers 
2n  1 figure s1b left since the occurrence of asp had raised extensive concerns about a possible outbreak and community spread of covid19
19
 
20
 
21
 we then incorporated the effect of asymptomatic cases model 1 the complete model we found the fitting was markedly improved and several fits to epidemic data from jiangsu province had even reached a 
2n  01 figure 1a parameters were shown in table s1 we further fit our model to data from anhui province kinetic parameters c and a were reestimated table s1 and the results showed that the revised model formulation could also faithfully match the data figure 1b these results suggested that the effect of asp and threshold behaviors in healthcare capacity contributed significantly to model fittingwe next performed local sensitivity analysis to identify critical parameters for covid19 epidemic we used maximal infected patients as the metric to evaluate the local sensitivity we found that only a small fraction of parameters exhibited strong or moderate sensitivities the sensitivity patterns were qualitatively similar between jiangsu and anhui model figure 2ab the discharge rate  showed strong negative regulation for maximally infected patients in both models figure 2ab the transition from close contacts to asp 
1 and contacts between susceptible population and close contacts 
1 profoundly increased the maximal infection not surprisingly the size of susceptible population s and close contacts c positively contributed to viral outbreak these results characterized the locally sensitive parameters which potentially affected viral outbreaksto avoid fitting bias toward local minimum in parametric space we then performed model fitting from stochastic parameter sets totally 400 runs were performed and the top 50 200 sets with a maximal total 
2n  00904 were selected for analysis we found that parameters related to asp were not significantly different between jiangsu and anhui provinces suggesting that asymptomatic cases had similar epidemic 
3 
1  and 
2 figure 3 the discharge rate  in anhui province was faster figure 4 meanwhile patient recovery rate  was also significantly larger than that in jiangsu province figure 3 which is consistent with the epidemic data that all infected patients were cured before march 9 upto 6 days ahead compared with jiangsu province during stochastic fitting we found that the initial number of asp approached zero 00024 in jiangsu province and 01268 in anhui province therefore we set initial asp to zero the parameter n in jiangsu and anhui model was only slightly larger than one implying minimal cooperativity however the threshold level for healthcare capacity k in jiangsu province was significantly larger than that in anhui province p  26982  107 figure 3 implying better healthcare resources in jiangsu province the initial number of close contacts c and their interaction with susceptible population 
1 were enhanced in jiangsu province possibly owing to the larger population in jiangsu province figure 3 collectively the stochastic parameter fitting could unravel both the differences and similarity of covid19 epidemic in jiangsu and anhui provincesthe asp covert cases or patients with no symptoms have become a new epidemiological puzzle and may potentially trigger a secondary outbreak

 under strong controlled interventions such as quarantine and community surveillance the mutual contact among susceptible population close contacts infected patients and asymptomatic cases was almost completely blocked ie extremely low 
i i  1 2 3 however if the strong intervention becomes mild the mutual contacts among all population will be increased ie larger 
i the increased fold in all 
i values was simulated by multiplying 
i with a contact factor f 
i  f  
i i  1 2 3 therefore f  1 indicated strongly controlled interventions whereas higher f 1 values indicated mild or no interventions we also varying the number of asp and then recorded the maximal infected population if there was a covid19 outbreak the latent period was defined as the time when the total infected cases became monotonically increased and finally reached a high peak at least two orders of magnitude larger than the initial patient numbers an exemplified case was shown figure 4a when asp  100 and controlled intervention was slightly reduced ie mutual contact was increased f  15 the infected cases were rapidly tolerated figure 4a left however if f was increased to 4 there would be an outbreak figure 4a right extensive simulations showed there was no outbreak if f  16 irrespective of the initial asymptomatic populations figure 4b however if f  16 even a small size of asymptomatic population asp  20 would lead to outbreak although the latent period seemed longer figure 4b top for f  28 the latent period was less than 10 days figure 4b top the latent period and outbreak size were sensitive to contact factor f increase mutual contact among populations while remained relatively insensitive to initial number of asp figure 4b similar behaviors could be observed in anhui model although the threshold for f was reduced to 13 figure 4c these results suggested that strongly controlled intervention to reduce mutual contact is highly effective to block viral outbreakthere are more and more imported patients in china since the coronavirus outbreak surges worldwide we then investigated the effect of imported cases to viral epidemic we varied the initial population of imported patients and contact factor f to explore whether an outbreak would be initiated we found that mutual contact contact factor f among different populations susceptible close contact infected and asymptomatic was also the major determinant for viral outbreak in both jiangsu and anhui models figure 5ab the latent period and the outbreak size were both sensitive to changes in contact factor f in both jiangsu and anhui models figure 5ab we further considered dynamic importation a daily importation occurs with different numbers of imported patients results suggested that the mutual contact markedly affected the outbreak size see supporting information discussion 12 taken together lowering mutual contact remains a sensitive strategy to impede coronavirus spreadingthe latent periods and outbreak sizes were compared for identical contact factor f and initial importedasymptomatic populations results suggested that the latent period for imported cases was uniformly longer than that of asymptomatic cases figure 6a accordingly the outbreak size for asymptomatic cases were larger than that of imported cases figure 6b collectively the simulation suggested that asp can more rapidly trigger a coronavirus outbreak with larger outbreak sizesin current work we used modelingbased approaches to investigate the impact of asymptomatic and imported cases on the potentially new outbreaks we developed a model with two novel features asymptomatic cases and threshold behavior in recovery our model can faithfully fit the epidemic data from jiangsu and anhui provinces in china the model predictions indicated that asymptomatic cases are a more serious threat compared with importation into china the asymptomatic or covert patients can trigger outbreaks more rapidly and terminate with larger outbreak sizes if the strongly controlled measures become mildbased on the daily reports from jiangsu and anhui commission of health we constructed a refined model after the closure of wuhan the start of outbreak in china we evaluated the epidemic features based on unbiased parameter estimation results suggested that both jiangsu and anhui provinces have implemented highly effective interventions low 
i values upto 1012 specifically there is stronger control in jiangsu province with significantly lower 
1 possibly leading to fewer total infections in jiangsu province furthermore based on the temporal data the proportion of asymptomatic cases in dynamic and we estimated a median proportion approximately 4446 interquartile range 37315372 which is consistent with a recent report
19

from the sensitivity analysis we found that regulating 
2 or 
3 alone plays neglectable role to block coronavirus outbreak there is no feasible way to alter total population s and discharge rate  either the seemingly only way to impede viral transmission is simultaneously lowering mutual contacts 
i we found that the latent periods and outbreak sizes are remarkably sensitive to the contact factor f note that the surface plot was removed if there was no predicted outbreak under strong interventions f approaches 1 our model predictions suggested that even a total of 500 imported or asp will not lead to coronavirus outbreak figures 5 and 6 however if the strict interventions were attenuated f  16 in jiangsu and 13 in anhui there will be a predicted outbreak a recent estimation of mutual contact suggested that under uncontrolled situations the average contact rate ie mutual contact is increased by aproximately 30799 1032469 fold
17
 corresponding to a contact factor f  30799 in our model if f  3 our model predictions demonstrated that the latent period ie decision time to trigger an outbreak is less than 1 day and a potentially final outbreak size aproximately 107 therefore strongly controlled interventions are still required provided the undetectable populations of asymptomatic cases notably since the middle of march china has taken strong measures to control imported personnels in airports and railway stations eg quarantine and covid19 test the imported cases will be immediately isolated with no contact with susceptible populations however asp are not easily found and remain a major threatour model predictions emphasized that the asp seem to be a more devastating factor compared with imported patients identical numbers of asymptomatic cases give rise to faster outbreaks and larger outbreak sizes even minimal asp may result in significant viral transmissions or local outbreaks we suggested that covid19 tests should be used for individuals in dense populations eg students teachers or healthcare workers the extensive tests may help to identify the hidden asp to impede potential outbreaks since april 1 china has begun to include detected asymptomatic cases in daily report
24
 therefore strong interventions should be taken especially for asp owing to the unpredictable and covert featuresliu et al
25
 recently showed a model with asymptomatic patients however the asymptomatic patients all become diagnosed ones with symptoms and are more likely to be presymptomatic
26
 this is in contrast with the recent definition for asp
19
 
20
 
21

our model also has limitations we did not incorporate death into our model similar to some recent models
8
 
18
 
27
 for jiangsu province there is no mortality in anhui province the mortality is extremely low 6990 06 the model can provide faithful fitting under these situations therefore our model might be helpful for understanding the epidemic features in most provinces from china however high mortality rates occur in wuhan china and several countries in europe a variable describing dead cases should be integrated with reestimated parameters the peak predictions in jiangsu and anhui model are lower than official epidemic data note that the coronavirus outbreak coincides with the traditional chinese new year the capacity for testing is therefore lowered at the start of epidemic a timevarying diagnosed rate could be incorporated to reach better model fittingdespite the limitations above the current study faithfully fits the epidemic data our model has predicted that the asymptomatic cases are factors with higher risk compared with imported cases and emphasized the critical role of strict interventions the demographic stochasticity is worthy of further investigations using stochastic modelsthe authors declare that there are no conflict of intereststzs and dw supervised the study

region has hosted novel coronaviruses since 2012 8in mid-february 2020 the first nine confirmed cases of covid-19 were reported in the eastern mediterranean region eight cases from the united arab emirates tested positive between january 29 and february 9 2020 one case from egypt was confirmed on february 14 2020 the ministry of health and prevention of the united arab emirates announced that three of the reported cases recovered and were discharged from the hospital during the second week of february 2020 the confirmed case in egypt was asymptomatic and had a history of travel to china 9 as of april 26 2020 the who has reported 160586 confirmed covid-19 cases with 6887 deaths in the emr 5on january 30 2020 the who declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic 10 since then countries in the eastern mediterranean region have been striving to enhance preparedness and taking measures to ensure early detection and rapid response 9 the situation of covid-19 in affected countries is changing daily this study was designed to investigate trends of covid-19 in the eastern mediterranean region with particular reference to pakistandata were collected daily from the pakistan ministry of national health services regulations and coordination covid-19 dashboard and situation updates from the european centre for disease prevention and control 11-12 the study included reports and updates from february 14 to april 26 2020 with particular reference to eastern mediterranean countries the data related to the number of cases deaths and recoveries were extracted from reports and recorded on spreadsheets for analysis emr countries with less than 90 cases on march 16 2020 pakistan surpassed 100 cases on march 16 2020 were not included in the studythe true numbers of cases in the emr countries were calculated based on the estimation that a substantial number of covid-19 cases do not get reported and only 14 of the cases have been reported 13 the number of total cases reported on april 26 2020 was used for calculating 86 of missing true cases the case fatality rate cfr and recovery rate were calculated using the following equationsa case

diagnosed with disease x 100the number of cases that emr countries might expect by june 20 2020 was estimated by using a calculator based on the susceptible infected recovered sir model a standard epidemiological model that is used to estimate disease dynamics 14 these calculations were based on the following assumptionsa every infected symptomatic person interacts with seven people a dayb every infected asymptomatic person interacts with 15 people a day as of april 26 2020 iran had the highest number of total of covid-19 confirmed cases 89329 in the emr with 15485 active cases 3096

challenge as of april 26 2020 pakistan had 12723 covid-19 cases in pakistan the covid-19 outbreak initially presented as sporadic two cases were reported on february 26 2020 and the volume of cases remained quite low 53 cases until march 15 2020 16 on march 16 2020 the number of cases quickly rose to 187 11 the majority of confirmed cases presented a recent history of travel to iran saudi arabia the united kingdom and italy 17 since we are comparing data with other countries in the emr it was important to analyze the number of confirmed cases relative to the size of the respective populations table 1 figure 3 15 the analysis showed that pakistan had 55 cases per million population on april 26 2020 close to iraq 42 casesmillion and egypt 40 casesmillion but far from saudi arabia 468 casesmillion the uae 938 casesmillion and iran 1064 casesmillion the number of confirmed cases per million population in pakistan was 003 during the first week of march 2020 and remained low 01 until march 14 2020 on march 21 2020 the number of casesmillion was 224 and doubled 542 on march 28 2020 11 despite being a close neighbor to both china and iran two epicenters of covid-19 pakistan remained free of sars-cov-2 until mid-february 2020 this may be due to the preventive steps taken by the government of pakistan at the beginning of the pandemic the government of pakistan issued a national preparedness and response plan for covid-19 as a blueprint for pandemic preparedness for pakistan under the global health security agenda ghsa after the pheic declaration issued by the world health organization 10 this plan included instructionsstandard operating protocol sops for international flight authorities authorities at other points of entries and health officials 18the number of confirmed cases was doubled in pakistan in 11 days table 2 which was relatively close to that which was observed in the uae 12 days and saudi arabia 8 days while iran 25 days and iraq 21 days had longer confirmed case doubling times longer confirmed case doubling times indicate a comparatively low spread of infection better understanding and implementation of social distancing and early detection of disease can limit the transmission of disease among the population 19 in pakistan two socio-demographic factors low literacy rate and poverty might be big hurdles in the observance of social distancing and might have contributed to the spread of disease 20 the literacy rate in pakistan is 59 21 most of the people do not understand the grave consequences of disease and do not follow clear instructions from the government in pakistan 243 of the people live below the poverty line earning their living on a day-to-day basis 22 therefore a complete lockdown by the government might not be implemented thus the daily interaction of symptomatic and asymptomatic covid-19 patients might be the reason behind the rapid spread of diseasethe number of deaths doubled in pakistan in 10 days however iraq 27 days and iran 26 days had a longer deaths doubling time table 2 in pakistan people may not understand the need to see a medical doctor unless they have severe symptoms furthermore they rely on unqualified practitioners due to the scarcity of government-provided health services poverty and lack of knowledge these factors compromise their health status and contribute to a large number of infected people seeking medical attention at a critical stage of the disease 23 this might be the underlying reason for the shortening of the death doubling timethe calculated case fatality rate of 21 for pakistan was lower than in other countries of this region ie egypt 71 iran 63 and iraq 49 table 2 the reason again might be that most people in pakistan do not have access to medical facilities especially those living in remote areas and villages that might be infected but were not tested 24 deaths in these underprivileged areas might not be reported or documented 23 another possible factor is 64 of the countrys population is under 30 years of age 25 this age group of people is very low risk for covid-19 due to a stronger immune system that may fight pathogens more efficiently 26the number of true cases in pakistan was estimated to be 90878 the only way of knowing the exact count of confirmed covid-19 cases depends upon the number of people tested pakistan with a population of 2209 million is the most populated country in the emr 27 the number of tests performed in the country was 625million population which is low considering the size of the population the number of testsmillion population in the uae 79875 and saudi arabia 5745 was significantly higher compared to pakistan this indicates that the actual number of covid-19 cases might be significantly higher than the reported figures only 57 public laboratories in the country are conducting covid-19 testing and capacity is furthermore considerably low 30000 testsday relative to the population of pakistan 1127 since only a limited number of people have access to expensive private testing facilities a majority of people remained undiagnosed due to costs another reason for the low detection of covid- 19 cases might be that 81 of patients only have mild symptoms and patients with mild symptoms were not tested or documented 3an important factor linked to disease spread is the basic reproduction number r0 which describes the average number of people who could be infected by a sick person currently pakistan has a local transmission rate of 806 28 as shown in figure 2 the number of people who might be infected in pakistan by june 20 2020 could be 051 million this means that pakistan could be ranked the third highest country in the emr after iran 212 million and saudi arabia 058 million by june 20 2020 a large number of covid-19 cases will burden the threshold of medical facilities in pakistan and might result in high mortality according to the economic survey of pakistan there are 1279 public sector hospitals in the country with 220829 registered doctors and 108474 registered nurses one doctor is available for 963 patients and there is one hospital bed per 1608 people 29 as of now there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral therapy for covid-19 although several therapeutic measures are being used on an experimental basis supportive care is provided to relieve symptoms and maintain the function of vital organs 30 thus the best strategy to fight the covid-19 pandemic is to strictly follow recommendations based on epidemiological principlesall countries and territories in the emr have reported cases of covid-19 however the number of cases and cfr varies among the emr countries pakistan has the third-highest confirmed cases with moderate case fatality and recovery rates if unswerving preventative and control measures are not adopted to prevent the widespread transmission of sars-cov-2 pakistan could experience an explosive surge in the number of covid-19 cases amounting to an estimated half a million cases by june 20 2020 as determined by the sir epidemiological model this study highlights the need for strategic development and the implementation of policies and programs focused on enhanced testing contact tracing quarantine and social distancing in pakistanan outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan hubei province china in early december 2019 has spiraled into an epidemic that is ravaging china and threatening to reach a pandemic state 1 the causative agent soon proved to be a new betacoronavirus related to the middle east respiratory syndrome virus mers-cov and the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus sars-cov the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 disease has been named covid-19 by the world health organization who and on january 30 the covid-19 outbreak was declared to constitute a public health emergency of international concern by the who director-general 2 despite the lockdown of wuhan and the suspension of all public transport flights and trains on january 23 a total of 40235 confirmed cases including 6484 161 with severe illness and 909 deaths 22 had been reported in china by the national health commission up to february 10 2020 meanwhile 319 cases and one death were reported outside of china in 24 countries 3the origin of covid-19 has not yet been determined although preliminary investigations are suggestive of a zoonotic possibly of bat origin 4 5 similarly to sars-cov and mers-cov the novel virus is transmitted from person to person principally by respiratory droplets causing such symptoms as fever cough and shortness of breath after a period believed to range from 2 to 14 days following infection according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 1 6 7 preliminary data suggest that older males with comorbidities may be at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 6 8 9 however the precise virologic and epidemiologic characteristics including transmissibility and mortality of this third zoonotic human coronavirus are still unknownusing the serial intervals si of the two other well-known coronavirus diseases mers and sars as approximations for the true unknown si zhao et al estimated the mean basic reproduction number r0 of sars-cov-2 to range between 224 95 ci 196-255 and 358 95 ci 289-439 in the early phase of the outbreak 10 very similar estimates 22 95 ci 14-39 were obtained for r0 at the early stages of the epidemic by imai et al 26 95 ci 15-35 11 as well as by li et al who also reported a doubling in size every 74 days 1 wu et al estimated the r0 at 268 95 ci 247286 with a doubling time every 64 days 95 ci 5871 and the epidemic growing exponentially in multiple major chinese cities with a lag time behind the wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks 12amidst such an important ongoing public health crisis that also has severe economic repercussions we reverted to mathematical modelling that can shed light to essential epidemiologic parameters that determine the fate of the epidemic 13 here we present the results of the analysis of time series of epidemiological data available in the public domain 1416 who cdc ecdc nhc and dxy from january 11 to february 10 2020 and attempt a three-week forecast of the spreading dynamics of the emerged coronavirus epidemic in the epicenter in mainland chinalet us first start with the estimation of r0 initially when the spread of the epidemic starts all the population is considered to be susceptible ie s  n based on this assumption by eqs 2 3 and 4 the basic reproduction number can be estimated by the parameters of the sird model as
r05let us denote with it  it  it  1 rt  rt  rt  1 dt  dt  dt  1 the reported new cases of infectious recovered and dead at time t with cit crt cdt the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases at time t thus

xt  cx1 cx2  cxtt the t  1 column vector containing the corresponding cumulative numbers up to time t on the basis of eqs 2 3 and 4 one can provide a coarse estimation of the parameters r0  and  as followsstarting with the estimation of r0 we note that as the province of hubei has a population of 59m one can reasonably assume that for any practical means at least at the beginning of the outbreak s  n by making this assumption one can then provide an approximation of the expected value of r0 using eqs 5 2 3 and 4 in particular substituting in eq 2 the terms it  1 and it  1 with rt  rt  rt  1 from eq 3 and dt  dt  dt  1 from eq 4 and bringing them into the left-hand side of eq 2 we get
itit1rtrt1dtdt1nst1it17adding eqs 3 and 4 we get
rtrt1dtdt1it1it18finally assuming that for any practical means at the beginning of the spread that st  1  n and dividing eq 7 by eq 8 we get
itit1rtrt1dtdt1rtrt1dtdt1r09note that one can use directly eq 9 to compute r0 with regression without the need to compute first the other parameters ie   and at this point the regression can be done either by using the differences per se or by using the corresponding cumulative functions instead of the differences for the calculation of r0 using eq 9 indeed it is easy to prove that by summing up both sides of eqs 7 and 8 over time and then dividing them we get the following equivalent expression for the calculation of r0
citcrtcdtcrtcdtr010here we used eq 10 to estimate r0 in order to reduce the noise included in the differences note that the above expression is a valid approximation only at the beginning of the spread of the diseasethus based on the above a coarse estimation of r0 and its corresponding confidence intervals can be provided by solving a linear regression problem using least-squares problem as
r0crtcdttcrtcdt1crtcdttcitcrtcdt11here we denote by  the case fatality and by  the case recovery ratios several approaches have been proposed for the calculation of the case fatality ratio see for example the formula used by the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china 18 for estimating the mortality ratio for the covid-19 and also the discussion in 19 here we adopt the one used also by the nhc which defines the case mortality ratio as the proportion of the total cases of infected cases that die from the diseasethus a coarse estimation of the case fatality and recovery ratios for the period under study can be calculated using the reported cumulative infected recovered and dead cases by solving a linear regression problem which for the case fatality ratio reads
cittcit1cittcdt12accordingly in an analogy to the above the case recovery ratio reads
cittcit1cittcrt13as the reported data are just a subset of the actual number of infected and recovered cases including the asymptomatic andor mild ones we have repeated the above calculations considering twenty times the reported number of infected and forty times the reported number of recovered in the toal population while leaving the reported number of dead the same given that their cataloguing is close to the actual number of deaths due to covid-19here we note that the new cases of recovered and deaths at each time time t appear with a time delay with respect to the actual number of infected cases this time delay is generally unknown but an estimate can be given by clinical studies however one could also attempt to provide a coarse estimation of these parameters based only on the reported data by considering the first period of the outbreak and in particular the period from the 11th of january to the 16th of january where the number of infected cases appear to be constant thus based on eqs 3 and 4 and the above assumption the effective per day recovery rate  and the effective per day mortality rate  were computed by solving the least squares problems see eqs 2 and 4
cit1cdt1crt1tcit1cdt1crt11cit1cdt1crt1tdt14
and
cit1cdt1crt1tcit1cdt1crt11cit1cdt1crt1trt15as noted these values do not correspond to the actual per day mortality and recovery rates as these would demand the exact knowledge of the corresponding time delays having provided an estimation of the above effective approximate values of the parameters  and  an approximation of the effective infected rate  that is not biased by the assumption of s  n can be obtained by using the sird simulator in particular in the sird model the values of the  and  parameters were set equal to the ones found using the reported data solving the corresponding least squares problems given by eqs 14 and 15 as initial conditions we have set one infected person on the 16th of november and ran the simulator until the last date for which there are available data here up to the 10th of february then the optimal value of the infection rate  that fits the reported data was found by wrapping around the sird simulator an optimization algorithm such as a nonlinear least-squares solver to solve the problem

using the first six days from the 11th of january r0 results in  480 90 ci 336-667 using the data until january 17 r0 results in  460 90 ci 356-565 using the data until january 18 r0 results in  514

fatality  and case recovery  ratios for the period january 16 to february 10 the confidence intervals are also depicted with dashed lines note that the large variation in the estimated values of  and  should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty this is also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals as more data are taken into account this variation is significantly reduced thus using all the available data from the 11th of january until the 10th of february the estimated value of the case fatality ratio  is  294 90 ci 29-3 and that of the case recovery ratio  is  005 90 ci 0046-0055 it is interesting to note that as the available data become more the estimated case recovery ratio increases significantly from the 31th of january see fig 2in figs 3 4 and 5 we show the coefficients of determination r2 and the root of mean squared errors rmse for r0  and  respectivelythe computed approximate values of the effective per day mortality and recovery rates of the sird model were   001 and   0064 corresponding to a recovery period of  15 d note that because of the extremely small number of the data used the confidence intervals have been disregarded instead for our calculations we have considered intervals of 20 around the expected least squares solutions hence for  we have taken the interval 0008 and 0012 and for  we have taken the interval between 005 and 0077 corresponding to recovery periods from 13 to 20 days as described in the methodology we have also used the sird simulator to provide an estimation of the effective infection rate  by optimization with w1  1 w2  2 w3  2 thus we performed the simulations by setting   0064 and   001 and as initial conditions one infected zero recovered and zero dead on november 16th 2019 and ran until the 10th of february the optimal with respect to the reported confirmed cases from the 11th of january to the 10th of february value of the infected rate  was  0191 90 ci 019-0192 this corresponds to a mean value of the basic reproduction number r026 note that this value is lower compared to the value that was estimated using solely the reported datafinally using the derived values of the parameters    we performed simulations until the end of february the results of the simulations are given in figs 6 7 and 8 solid lines depict the evolution when using the expected mean estimations and dashed lines illustrate the corresponding lower and upper bounds as computed at the limits of the confidence intervals of the estimated parametersas figs 6 and 7 suggest the forecast of the outbreak at the end of february through the sird model is characterized by high uncertainty in particular simulations result in an expected number of  180000 infected cases but with a high variation the lower bound is at  45000 infected cases while the upper bound is at  760000 cases similarly for the recovered population simulations result in an expected number of  60000 while the lower and upper bounds are at  22000 and  170000 respectively finally regarding the deaths simulations result in an average number of  9000 with lower and upper bounds  2700 and  34000 respectivelythus the expected trends of the simulations suggest that the mortality rate is lower than the estimated with the current data and thus the death toll is expected to be significantly less compared with the expected trends of the predictionsas this paper was revised the reported number of deaths on the 22th february was 2344 while the expected number of the forecast was 4300 with a lower bound of 1300 regarding the number of infected and recovered cases by february 20 the cumulative numbers of confirmed reported cases were 64084 infected and 15299 recovered while the expected trends of the forecasts were 83000 for the infected and 28000 for the recovered cases hence based on this estimation the evolution of the epidemic was well within the bounds of our forecastingfor our illustrations we assumed that the number of infected is twenty times the number of the confirmed infected and forty times the number of the confirmed recovered people based on this scenario fig 9 depicts an estimation of r0 for the period january 16-january 20 using the first six days from the 11th of january to the 16th of january r0 results in 32 90 ci 24-40 using the data until january 17 r0 results in 31 90 ci 25-37 using the data until january 18 r0 results in 34 90 ci 29-39 using the data until january 19 r0 results in 39 90 ci 33-45 and using the data until january 20 r0 results in 45 90 ci 38-53it is interesting to note that the above estimation of r0 is close enough to the one reported in other studies see in the introduction for a reviewfig 10 depicts the estimated values of the case fatality  and case recovery  ratios for the period january 16 to february 10 the confidence intervals are also depicted with dashed lines note that the large variation in the estimated values of  and  should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty this is also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals as more data are taken into account this variation is significantly reduced thususing all the scaled data from the 11th of january until the 10th of february the estimated value of the case fatality ratio  now drops to  0147 90 ci 0144-015 while that of the case recovery ratio is  01 90 ci 0091-011 it is interesting also to note that as the available data become more the estimated case recovery ratio increases slightly see fig 10 while the case fatality ratio in the total population seems to be stabilized at a rate of  015in figs 11 12 and 13 we show the coefficients of determination r2 and the root of mean squared errors rmse for r0  and  respectivelythe computed values of the effective per day mortality and recovery rates of the sird model were   00005 and  016d1 corresponding to a recovery period of  6 d note that because of the extremely small number of the data used the confidence intervals have been disregarded instead for calculating the corresponding lower and upper bounds in our simulations we have taken intervals of 20 around the expected least squares solutions hence for  we have taken the interval 00004 and 00006 and for  we have taken the interval between 013 and 019 corresponding to an interval of recovery periods from 5 to 8 daysagain we used the sird simulator to provide estimation of the infection rate by optimization setting w1  1 w2  400 w3  1 to balance the residuals of deaths with the scaled numbers of the infected and recovered cases thus to find the optimal infection transmission rate we used the sird simulations with   016d1 and   00005 and as initial conditions one infected zero recovered zero deaths on november 16th 2019 and ran until the 10th of februarythe optimal with respect to the reported confirmed cases from the 11th of january to the 10th of february value of the infected rate  was found to be  031990 ci 0318-032 this corresponds to a mean value of the basic reproduction number r02finally using the derived values of the parameters    we have run the sird simulator until the end of february the simulation results are given in figs 14 15 and 16 solid lines depict the evolution when using the expected mean estimations and dashed lines illustrate the corresponding lower and upper bounds as computed at the limits of the confidence intervals of the estimated parametersagain as figs 15 and 16 suggest the forecast of the outbreak at the end of february through the sird model is characterized by high uncertainty in particular in scenario ii by february 29 simulations result in an expected actual number of 8m infected cases corresponding to a 13 of the total population with a lower bound at 720000 and an upper bound at 37m cases similarly for the recovered population simulations result in an expected actual number of 45m corresponding to a 8 of the total population while the lower and upper bounds are at 430000 and 23m respectively finally regarding the deaths simulations under this scenario result in an average number of 14000 with lower and upper bounds at 900 and 100000importantly under this scenario the simulations shown in fig 14 suggest a decline of the outbreak at the end of february table 1 summarizes the above results for both scenarioswe note that the results derived under scenario ii seem to predict a slowdown of the outbreak in hubei after the end of februarywe have proposed a methodology for the estimation of the key epidemiological parameters as well as the modelling and forecasting of the spread of the covid-19 epidemic in hubei china by considering publicly available data from the 11th of january 2020 to the 10th of february 2020by the time of the acceptance of our paper according to the official data released on the 29th of february the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases in hubei was 67000 that of recovered was 31300 and the death toll was 2800 these numbers are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of february that are based on scenario i importantly by assuming a 20-fold scaling of the confirmed cumulative number of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number of the recovered cases in the total population forecasts show a decline of the outbreak in hubei at the end of february based on this scenario the case fatality rate in the total population is of the order of 015at this point we should note that our sird modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics the heterogeneous contact transmission network the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic the characteristics of the population eg the effect of the age people who had already health problems also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported of note covid-19 which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route 21 had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of wuhan on january 23 having thus infected unknown numbers of people the number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial these cases which possibly represent the bulk of the covid-19 infections remain unrecognized especially during the influenza season 22 this highly likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context distorting epidemiologic realityanother important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases a positive pcr test was required to be considered a confirmed case by chinas novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program in the early phase of the outbreak 14 however the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel viral pathogen may only be 30-50 thereby often resulting in false negatives particularly early in the course of illness to complicate matters further the guidance changed in the recently-released fourth edition of the program on february 6 to allow for diagnosis based on clinical presentation but only in hubei province 14the swiftly growing epidemic seems to be overwhelming even for the highly efficient chinese logistics that did manage to build two new hospitals in record time to treat infected patients supportive care with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo in intensive care units icus is critical for severe respiratory disease large-scale capacities for such level of medical care in hubei province or elsewhere in the world for that matter amidst this public health emergency may prove particularly challenging we hope that the results of our analysis contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak so as to contain the novel coronavirus as soon as possible and mitigate its effects regionally in mainland china and internationallyin the digital and globalized world of today new data and information on the novel coronavirus and the evolution of the outbreak become available at an unprecedented pace still crucial questions remain unanswered and accurate answers for predicting the dynamics of the outbreak simply cannot be obtained at this stage we emphatically underline the uncertainty of available official data particularly pertaining to the true baseline number of infected cases that may lead to ambiguous results and inaccurate forecasts by orders of magnitude as also pointed out by other investigators 1 17 22in december 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus respiratory disease called covid-19 was
detected in wuhan china the outbreak was caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the outbreak is now widespread and who declared a pandemic on
march 11 2020 when the disease was reported in 114 countries1 the
primary mode of transmission of sars-cov-2 is via respiratory droplets that people produce
when they cough sneeze or exhale and the virus may also be spread via fomites2 sars-cov-2 is 82 similar to the sars coronavirus that caused an outbreak in
2003 then 1673 of patients with sars were reported to have diarrhea in addition
to respiratory symptoms3 and transmission of sars through water droplets
from faeces via air ventilation systems in amoy gardens in hong kong was reported4 diarrhea is also reported in a significant proportion of the covid-19 cases
and recent reports show that sars-cov-2 has been detected in stool samples of covid-19
cases59 the shedding of sars-cov-2
was studied in a cluster of nine cases and was present at 107 rna copiesstool
swab of a gram faeces one week after symptom onset and decreased to 103 rna
copiesswab three weeks after symptom onset10 these authors could not
detect infectious sars-cov-2 in stool samples with high rna concentrations another
study11 reported that in two out of four stool samples with high
sars-cov-2 rna concentrations infective sars-cov-2 was detected with cultures combined with
electron microscopy although it is unlikely that wastewater will become an important
transmission pathway for coronaviruses like sars-cov-212 increasing
circulation of the virus in the population will increase the virus load into the sewer
systems of our cities it is important to collect information about the occurrence and fate
of this new virus in sewage to understand if they pose a health risk to workers exposed to
wastewater moreover sewage surveillance13 of sars-cov-2 rna could be a
tool to monitor the circulation of covid-19 in our communities this could complement
current clinical surveillance which is underreporting the true number of people infected
with sars-cov-2 as testing is limited to the covid-19 patients with the most severe
symptoms sewage surveillance could also serve as an early warning of reemergence of
covid-19 in cities much like the sewage surveillance for the poliovirus that has been in
place in the netherlands and other countries for this purpose14 the
objective of this investigation was to identify if sars-cov-2 rna is present in domestic
wastewater of cities and a main airport during the early stages of the covid-19 epidemic in
the netherlands the sars-cov-2 rna signal strength in wastewater at the inlet of the
wastewater treatment plant was compared to the reported covid-19 cases in the service area
of that plant to obtain an indication of the sensitivity of sewage surveillance for
sars-cov-2 rnabefore the onset of the epidemic in the netherlands wastewater treatment plants wwtp
were selected that serve two large- and three medium-sized cities and the main airport
supporting information tables s1 s2 the operators of the wwtp sampled a 24 h flow-dependent
composite sample of 250 ml that was stored at 4 c during sampling four rounds of
samples were taken in february and march 2020 supporting information table s2 the first sampling round turned out to be 3 weeks before the
first covid-19 case was recognized by the health surveillance system in the netherlands
on february 2715 the second third and fourth sampling rounds were 1
week 25 weeks and 4 weeks into the epidemic in the netherlands as the epidemic
progressed a wwtp tilburg in one of the most affected areas was included in the
sampling schemesample transport concentration by ultrafiltration extraction of viral rna and
quantification of rna with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and the
quality assurance of these methods are detailed in the supporting information four primersprobe sets were used in this study the
n1n3 set from the cdc16 that each target a different region of
the nucleocapsid n gene and the set against the envelope protein e gene from corman et
al17 to include targets against two separate sars-cov-2 genes
supporting information table s4to get an indication of the sensitivity of the monitoring of sewage a proxy for the
period prevalence of covid-19 in the cities served by the wwtp sampled was created using
1 the cumulative number of covid-19 cases reported per day from february 27 to march
2615 for the cities that are served by each of the wwtp as the
numerator and 2 the number of people served by each of the wwtp as the denominator the
number of inhabitants in the catchment of the wwtp was estimated from the design capacity
in inhabitant equivalents of each of the wwtp and the average difference between design
capacity and number of inhabitants in the netherlands supporting information table s2the recovery of f-specific rna phages by the purification and concentration steps was 73
 50 n  16 no trends were observed between the sample volume
processed and phage recovery the nonenveloped f-specific rna phages may overestimate the
recovery efficiency of the enveloped sars-cov-2 ye et al18 showed
that ultrafiltration recovered 55 of ms2 a f-specific rna phage spiked to raw
wastewater compared to 25 for the murine coronavirus model studies by these authors
estimated that 26 of the murine coronavirus absorbed to wastewater solids compared to 6
for ms2 which would partially explain the lower recovery efficiency they observed for the
coronavirus this implies that a proportion of the sars-cov-2 virus particles may have
been present in the particulate fraction that was removed by the centrifugation step the
recovery efficiency of the rna extraction and qrt-pcr combined was evaluated in 16 samples
with the internal control ic rna supporting information and showed a recovery of 304  223 also
here no trend was observed between the recovery and volume of sample processed the
slopes of the standard curves for the quantification of the n-gene assays were
329  012 for n1 348  014 for n2 and 347 
011 for n3 respective y-intercept values were 4244  046 4388  019 and
4324  057 and amplification efficiencies were 985  13 943  52
and 943  41 for the n1 n2 and n3 quantification with a correlation coefficient
of 0997  0002 0992  0009 and 0987  0015 the results of the
qrt-pcr assays are presented without correcting for recovery efficiencies reliable
quantification of sars-cov-2 with qrt-pcr in sewage will be required to make reliable
covid-19 surveillance via sewage feasible therefore further development of controls to
consistently monitor coronavirus recovery efficiency of the concentration and
purification rna extraction and qrt-pcr is of great importance here nonenveloped f
rna phages were used which may overestimate the recovery efficiency of enveloped
viruses18 the analyses of an added quantified suspension of another
coronavirus such as mouse hepatitis virus18 to the sewage samples can
potentially be a feasible control to improve quantification reference materials for
qrt-pcr quantification would allow both intra- and interlaboratory comparison of qrt-pcr
results also digital droplet pcr could aid in the quantification of sars-cov-2 in water
as shown for other rna viruses19the results of the samples of february 6 2020 3 weeks before the first case was
reported in the netherlands on february 27 showed no positive signals for primer sets
n1n3 and e table 1a the samples of
march 4 and 5 1 week into the epidemic showed a positive signal for all primerprobe
sets in sewage of one of the six wwtp sampled utrecht at 1430 gene copies
gcml den haag produced a signal with three qrt-pcr assays at 1222 gcml on
march 4 but was negative again on march 5 table 1b schiphol was positive for n1 and n3 2612 gcml and amersfoort
for n3 66 gcml march 15 and 16 all qrt-pcr targets produced a signal at each of the
seven wwtp sampled 82200 gcml except for n1 in wwtp apeldoorn table 1c on march 25 all sewage samples were
positive for each of the assays at 261800 gcml table 1d high resolution electrophoresis with a bioanalyzer confirmed
that the length of the pcr products match the length of the pcr target gene fragments the
three n-gene assays ideally yield similar quantitative results the n2 and n3 assays
produced rna concentrations that differed by only 019  012 log10 gcml while n1
deviated more difference n1n2 037  016 log10 gcml n1n3 040
 023 log10 gcml for clinical samples the us fda reported the sensitivity of
the primerprobe sets of n1  n3  n2 on sars-cov-2 rna20 looking
at the samples of march 4 and 5 when signal strength was low the n1 and n3 assays each
picked up sars-cov-2 rna in three wwtp and n2 in two wwtpthe cumulative number of reported covid-19 cases in each of the cities served by the wwtp
figure 1 shows how the number of reported
cases increased at different rates in each of the cities as the epidemic spread tilburg
reported the most cases followed by utrecht and amsterdam the latter particularly from
march 18 onward the number of cases at the airport could not be estimated as the number
of covid-19 cases were not reported for this denominatorthe concentration of sars-cov-2 rna in sewage of each of the cities was compared to the
reported cumulative prevalence of covid-19 in the study period in the same city virus
shedding in stools of cases with mild or severe symptoms was reported to continue for 3 to
4 weeks after symptom onset and virus rna concentration in these stools were higher in
weeks three and four than in week two21 therefore it was considered
appropriate to use the cumulative prevalence per city for this four week study period
this provided a rough estimate of the cumulative prevalence of covid-19 since the service
areas of the wwtp do not precisely overlap with the city boundaries the sars-cov-2 rna
concentration as measured in the wwtp inlets for each of the monitoring days was plotted
against the cumulative prevalence observed on that day in that city figure 2 for each of the qrt-pcr assays an increase in the
sars-cov-2 rna concentration was observed as the number of reported covid-19 cases
increased combining data from all cities and all monitoring days the slope of the
increase was 062 log10 gene copies per log10 reported cases standard error se  012

n3 the slopes of n1 and n2 were impacted by the rna concentrations at the prevalence of

copy concentrations were available the cumulative prevalence was plotted against the
observed cycle threshold value the slope was 317 ct value per log10 reported
cases se  046 r2  077 p  0001
figure 2d even though there is a clear and
significant correlation for each of the qrt-pcr assays there is scatter in the combined
data of all the wwtp this may be caused by variations in virus rna recovery in the
detection method and variations in rna concentration in wastewater as well as by
variations in policies for virus testing in clinical samples between cities changes in
testing policy over the duration of the study has likely reduced the slopes in figure 2 each week the epidemic progressed more
people were tested not enough data were available to normalize the reported prevalence by
the number of tests per week the absence of positive qrt-pcr assays in sewage samples 3
weeks before covid-19 was first reported in the netherlands the detection of fragments of
two genes of sars-cov-2 in sewage of multiple wwtp in a temporal pattern that aligns with
the emergence of the epidemic in the netherlands and the observed significant correlation
between the rna concentration in sewage and the cumulative prevalence of covid-19 provide
compelling evidence that sars-cov-2 rna is detected in sewage it also indicates that
sewage surveillance of sars-cov-2 rna could be a tool for monitoring trends in covid-19
prevalence in cities which is very valuable information to support social distancing
policies to substantiate this relation between virus rna concentration in sewage and
covid-19 prevalence more precise quantification of virus rna in sewage and of covid-19
cases in the cities is needed and more data are needed per city and at different cities
and towns for the e gene assay translation to gene copy per ml is underway the
development of the sars-cov-2 rna concentration in sewage will be monitored as the
epidemic progresses to determine if sewage surveillance continues to follow the
epicurvethe detection of n3 in wwtp amersfoort on march 5 when no cases had been reported in
amersfoort suggests virus circulation in the population before covid-19 cases are
reported through the health surveillance system the first two cases in amersfoort were
reported on march 11 so the sewage signaled virus circulation in amersfoort 6 days
before the first cases were noted figure 2 shows
that the n and e assays started to produce signals in sewage samples when the observed
covid-19 prevalence was around or even below 10 case in 100000 people given the
roughness of the prevalence estimates these numbers are indicative but do indicate that
sewage surveillance with the method used in this study is sensitiveother authors have reported on sars-cov-2 rna in city sewage2224 in brisbane 0019012 gene copies per ml were
detected23 and wu et al24 reported 10240
gene copies per ml in boston ahmed et al23 estimated that the
concentrations in sewage matched with the prevalence in brisbane but wu et al24 suggested that their concentrations implied a much higher covid-19
prevalence 015 than reported 0026 however an absolute comparison
between prevalence of people infected with sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-2 rna concentration in
sewage may prove difficult since the reported prevalence depends heavily on the policy and
method of clinical testing the testing policy in the netherlands focused on people with a
travel history to hubei or italy people with severe symptoms and healthcare workers a
study among healthcare workers in the netherlands indicated that sars-cov-2 was already
circulating undetected in the community a week prior to february 27 when the first
covid-19 case was reported suggesting that there is a high prevalence of mild covid-19 in
the community25 recent serological surveys in the netherlands and
elsewhere show that the percentage of people that have been infected with covid-19 is much
higher than reported through clinical surveillance and is in the range of
11426 while absolute estimates of covid-19 prevalence
based on sars-cov-2 rna concentrations in sewage are complex our data suggest that
surveillance of relative changes in sars-cov-2 rna concentrations at the inlet of wwtp
over time can serve as a sensitive tool for early warning for increasing virus circulation
in the populationas of the beginning of june 2020 the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic has now reached over 6 million confirmed cases worldwide over 17 million in the united states alone and approximately 370000 deaths worldwide according to the johns hopkins university coronavirus resource center covid-19 case counts are alarming in both their volume and widening geographic scope there are also concerns about the accuracy of reported covid-19 case counts particularly at earlier stages of the pandemic and whether underreporting may have obscured the true extent of the outbreak its underlining epidemiological characteristics and its overall health and societal impact 1-3specifically concerns regarding covid-19 underreporting are influenced by factors such as lack of access to testing kits a lag in reporting and registering cases due to overburdened health systems failure to report or test before or after a covid-19-suspected death variation in testing administration or decision making eg foregoing testing when it would not change the course of treatment for a patient and uncomplicated mild or asymptomatic cases simply never being tested or seeking care 45 concerns about underreporting have been pervasive with media reports highlighting challenges in countries with outbreaks of different scale and at varying time periods including the united states china iran and russia to name a few 6-9accurate estimations of the number of people who have recovered from covid-19 are also difficult to ascertain the john hopkins university coronavirus resource center covid-19 data dashboard is one source that aggregates the number of reported covid-19 recovered cases which now stands at over 26 million worldwide however case reporting on recoveries can be difficult to measure and define leading to potential overestimation of the mortality rate and underestimation of community spread that can complicate efforts toward estimating population immunity 5 reflecting these challenges covid-19 recovered cases are often limited to data aggregated at the country or national level are derived only from confirmed cases and may differ based on the definition of recovery or method of confirmation 510in response this study sought to better understand the characteristics of publicly available self-reported user-generated conversations associated with terms that could be related to covid-19 symptoms recoveries and testing experiences this was accomplished using a retrospective observational infoveillance study during earlier stages of the global pandemic infoveillance studies which use data from the internet social media and other information in an electronic medium for disease surveillance purposes have been used in prior outbreaks eg h1n1 ebola 11-15 there is also an emerging base of literature using social media and website search results to explore the covid-19 pandemic 16-21this retrospective infoveillance study was conducted in two phases 1 data collection using the public streaming twitter application programming interface api for covid-19-related keywords and 2 data cleaning processing and analysis of tweets using an unsupervised machine learning approach by means of natural language processing followed by subsequent statistical and geospatial analysis of twitter message characteristicswe first collected tweets by filtering for general covid-19-related keywords including covid19 corona coronavirus coronavid19 following the collection of a corpus of general covid-19 tweets we further filtered this corpus for terms that could be associated with covid-19 symptoms testing and recovery conversations these additional terms included diagnosed pneumonia fever test testing kit sharing symptoms isolating cough er emergency room and emergency room the covid-19-related keywords were chosen based on relevance to general covid-19 social media conversations as used in prior studies 161822 filtered terms were chosen based on manual searches conducted by the study team prior to the commencement of the study where user-generated tweets associated with covid-19 symptoms were detected and the terms used were assesseddata was collected from the twitter public api from march 3-20 2020 for data processing we first removed hashtags stop words and the top 100 news twitter handles or accounts we removed the top news accounts as the focus of this study was on user-generated content both first- and secondhand accounts of covid-19 experiences not covid-19 news and media sources of informationfor data analysis we used the biterm topic model btm an unsupervised machine learning approach to extract themes from groups of texts as used in prior studies to detect substance abuse disorder and other public health issues 23-25 groups of messages or text containing the same word-related themes are categorized into clusters the main themes of those clusters are considered as the topic of the text aggregation which is then split into a bag of words where a discrete probability distribution for each theme is generated 26 using btm we identified topic clusters with word groupings frequencies and characteristics that appeared to be related to symptoms recovery and testing experiences with covid-19 signal and then extracted tweets from these topic clusters for manual annotationthe number of topic clusters we chose to extract k can affect the results associated with these topics too many clusters could lead to diffusion of signal while too few clusters may conceal possible signals in the topics to address this we used a coherence score to measure the quality of the number of topics we chose by measuring how correlated the texts are in the same clusters a higher coherence score means the text in the cluster are more correlated to each other we chose five different k values for the number of clusters k510152025 then we calculated the coherence score and identified the k value with the highest score as a parameter for btmhere is how we calculate the u-mass coherence score ctvt we let dv be the document frequency of the word type v ie the number of documents containing at least one token of type v and dv v0 be the codocument frequency of word types v and v0 ie the number of documents containing one or more tokens of type v and at least one token of type v0 we define topic coherence as

vt   is a list of the m most probable words in topic t a smoothing count of 1 is included to avoid taking the logarithm of zeromanual annotation of tweets was conducted by authors vp ns mn and cb coding was focused on content analysis using an inductive coding scheme including a binary classification of whether the tweet discussed symptoms that could be related to covid-19 including firsthand or secondhand accounts experiences with seeking covid-19 testing access or disease recovery and the co-occurrence of these themes see multimedia appendix 1 for description of coding schema vp ns mn and cb coded posts independently and achieved high intercoder reliability kappa098 for inconsistent results authors reviewed and conferred on correct classification with author tmdata collection and analysis was conducted using the python python software foundation programming language and associated package tweepy statistical and geospatial analysis was carried out using rstudio 361 rstudio inc and arcgis esri for statistical analysis and geospatial visualization covid-19 cases from march 20 2020 were obtained from the jhu github cssegisanddata fileethics approval and consent to participate was not required for this study all information collected from this study was from the public domain and the study did not involve any interaction with users users indefinable information was removed from the study resultsa total of 72922211 tweets were collected from march 3-20 2020 from the twitter public api filtered for general covid-19-related keywords from this entire corpus we filtered for the previously mentioned additional terms associated with covid-19 symptoms testing and recovery conversations resulting in a filtered data set of 4492954 tweets ie this data set included tweets with both covid-19 general terms and at least one additional term btm was then used to analyze the filtered data set to identify relevant topic clusters after identifying topic clusters that had characteristics related to signal we extracted 35786 tweets contained in these btm topic clusters for the purposes of manual annotation ie this data set represents all tweets that were contained in relevant btm topic clusters selected for manual labelling after removing duplicates and manually annotating tweets 3465 000077 of the filtered data set posts from 2812 unique users were confirmed and identified as signal conversations related to symptoms testing experiences or recovery that users associated with covid-19 ie this data set represents true positives that were identified by manual annotationsignal tweets were grouped into five main thematic categories 1 firsthand and secondhand eg family friends reporting of suspected symptoms that users associated with covid-19 eg fever cough shortness of breath chills 2 symptom reporting with concurrent discussion of lack of access to covid-19 testing mostly due to rigorous criteria to qualify for testing eg symptom severity fever travel history insurance and with no confirmatory diagnosis 3 user discussion of recovery from suspected covid-19 symptoms 4 user confirmation of a negative covid-19 diagnosis after receiving testing and 5 users recalling symptoms in the past 5 months that they suspected as possibly associated with a covid-19 infection see deidentified examples in table 1metadata associated with users from these signal tweets indicated that the majority of these conversations were most likely organic ie originating and consisting of user-generated content though we did not explicitly filter our tweets for bot or spam traffic the average ratio of users followers to following was 160778 and only 111 users had accounts created recently in 2020 we also observed during our manual coding that these accounts generally included longer interactions with other users original content and profile information that had individually identifiable information or biographies generally these user metadata characteristics are reflective of organic content versus automated and social bot-based contentin addition to content analysis we assessed posts for descriptive longitudinal and geospatial trends by analyzing time stamps and location for the subset of tweets that were geotagged posts exhibited longitudinal trends with an overall increase during the study period with noticeable rapid increases from march 3-6 2020 and an uneven but gradual increase thereafter figures 1 and 2 out of the 35786 extracted tweets from the btm topic clusters 1769 494 included geospatial coordinates compared to 522958 071 and 22048 049 tweets that had coordinates in the entire corpus and the term-filtered data set respectively hence our total corpus is similar to other studies reporting that approximately 1 of all tweets were geotagged and our btm topic cluster output had an overall higher volume of geolocated tweets in its sample 2728 from a global standpoint 649 n1125 originated from the united states followed by the united kingdom n228 132 canada n52 30 india n52 30 and australia n43 25the high presence of us-based tweets and tweets from countries where the majority language is english with the exception of india is likely reflective of our sampling methodology which focused on english-language tweets and the fact that the highest proportion of twitter users are located in the united states this skewed geographic global distribution of tweets has also been explored in other studies that found a small number of countries led by the united states that account for a large share of the total twitter user population 29 the practical implications of this us-skewed geotagging mean that it is likely difficult to infer geospatial trends for tweets on specific covid-19-related topics for other countries unless data collection is more targeted eg collection of tweets in foreign languages in a specific time zone or targeting geotagging for country or region-specific shapefilesfrom a national perspective the us states with the most tweets associated with covid-19 symptoms and disease experiences were california n165 texas n126 new york n88 and illinois n54 which largely follows the most populous states in the country with the exception of florida manual coding revealed a similar ranking of symptom-related tweets that mentioned a state or city as self-reported by the user california n43 new york n33 texas n31 and georgia n16 even though these tweets had the highest frequency in larger states smaller states and states that had reported confirmed covid-19 cases eg washington state were also detected overall covid-19 associated symptom tweets exhibited wide distribution of twitter user locations including many in areas with high levels of population-normalized covid-19 confirmed case counts figure 3spearman correlations were also computed between the following variables associated with tweets collected conversations about symptom reporting experiences with lack of testing recovery from suspected symptoms and us location to assess co-occurrence of detected themes statistically significant positive correlations exceeding r03 were observed between tweets that included users self-reporting symptoms and experiences with lack of testing r033 p001 as well as self-reporting of symptoms and self-reported recovery from reported symptoms r045 p001this study identified tweets that included both first- and secondhand self-reporting of symptoms lack of access to testing and discussion of recovery that users associated with possible covid-19 the total volume of these covid-19 conversations increased over the time of the study particularly between march 3 and march 6 2020 also corresponding with a period that saw an increase in the number of confirmed cases in the united states the majority of these conversations related to first- or secondhand reporting of symptoms users associated with covid-19 with a subset of this group concurrently reporting that they could not get access to testing despite having covid-19-related symptoms other topics that occurred in lower frequency included self-reported recovery from symptoms users confirming they were not covid-19 positive and past accounts of symptoms users believed could have been undetected cases of covid-19 dating back as early as november 2019correlation analysis of themes generated by different tweets analyzed for this study found that it was more likely that users who self-reported symptoms they associated with covid-19 would also concurrently report experiences with lack of access to testing or recovery from said symptoms these results indicate that the publics lived experience with covid-19 included uncertainty about whether they or others were infected with covid-19 frustration that they could not get tested to confirm these concerns and sometimes their recovery experience from these symptoms however this study was not able to confirm if users reporting these experiences were actually covid-19 cases and users may similarly have not tweeted if they had eventually received confirmatory testing or otherwise if there was a change in their conditionimportantly ascertaining accurate case estimations of the covid-19 outbreak is critical to ensuring health care system capacity is not overburdened evaluating the impact of public health interventions better enabling comprehensive contact tracing including methods of digital contact tracing ensuring the accuracy and predictability of covid-19 disease mathematical modeling and assessing the real-world needs for covid-19 treatment medical equipment diagnostics and other supplies 3031 other online tools such as the website covid near you 32 have collected self-reported symptom and testing access data directly from the public to better inform these case estimationsrelatedly the value of our study is in its innovative approach using data mining in combination with modeling to sift through a large volume of unstructured data to detect and characterize potential underreported cases of covid-19 the methodology has particular utility for new and emerging topics such as a novel infectious disease outbreak where an existing training or labelled data set is not available for machine learning classification tasks specifically our study tapped into an existing publicly available data source to help characterize conversations from twitter users about their self-reported experiences with covid-19 and provides insight into one period of this evolving and rapidly spreading global pandemic it is our hope that this study can help inform future infoveillance efforts supplement traditional disease surveillance approaches and advance needed innovation to improve the scope and accuracy of future disease outbreak case estimations for covid-19 and future health emergenciesthis study has limitations we only collected data from one social media platform and limited study keywords and additional filtered terms to the english language this likely biased study results to english speakers and primarily english-speaking countries particularly since the highest number of twitter users are already located in the united states in fact in our final data set of signal tweets we did not observe any conversations in languages other than english our keywords and filtered terms were also chosen on the basis of our own manual searches on the platform but may not have been inclusive of all twitter conversations related to the study aims future studies should expand data collection and analysis approaches to different languages and phrases associated with covid-19 symptoms testing and recovery to obtain a more worldwide representative corpus of social media conversations we also did not cross-validate the veracity of user-generated comments with other data sources eg confirmed case reports additional survey data death certificates data on other diseases with similar symptoms or electronic medical records future studies should explore combining multiple data layers from different sources to better validate whether user-generated self-reporting is highly associated with confirmed cases case clusters and disease transmission trends using traditional syndromic and other infoveillance approaches while also controlling for seasonal incidence of symptomatically similar diseases upper respiratory infections pneumonia and flu or influenza additionally though we used data filtering and btm to more efficiently analyze a large corpus of tweets we nevertheless relied on manual annotation to confirm whether tweets contained a signal this was particularly important to remove false positives generated by our btm outputs ie the word testing can take on different meaning depending on the context of a conversation future studies should also focus on developing feature-based supervised machine learning classifiers based on identified conversation characteristics reported in this study to detect self-reported covid-19 experiences with symptoms testing and recovery specifically supervised models that can leverage validated training sets are likely to have a much higher performance in terms of precision and recall compared to the use of topic models used in this study and could likely achieve classification closer to real time given that accurate case estimations are more effective when they are timely and can be acted upon quickly these future approaches would likely have more utility in aiding with unreported case detection identifying potentially vulnerable or at-risk populations and better elucidating the publics lived experiences with covid-19all over the world severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has been the most important public health issue this year recently this was re-named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who sars-cov-2 is also included in the coronavirus family along with sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 1 covid-19 was first reported in wuhan china 23 in december 2019 since then covid-19 has spread rapidly all over the world 4 and has killed more than 226000 people worldwide so far this rapid spread is suspected via not only human-to-human but also interspecies transmissions 5 the who declared a pandemic on march 11according to the early studies the most common symptoms are known as fever cough difficulty in breathing sputum and sore throat 67 in fact however many patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms in early stages and so they do not realize being infected since covid-19 is highly contagious in early stages such lack of recognition can cause serious problems for the prevention of the spread of covid-19 therefore detection of covid-19 in early even asymptomatic stages will help us reduce transmissionrecently olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is often reported as a symptom 89 we need to pay more attention because the symptom might be easily overlooked in clinical field and so the diagnosis could be delayed in this review we reviewed recent findings of the viral infection-related olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions to identify a correlation between the olfactory or gustatory symptoms and corona virus and the values of olfactory dysfunction as an early sign of covid-19 even in asymptomatic patientswe searched the articles using pubmed and embase the first keyword was viral infection coronavirus rhinovirus influenza covid sars or mers the second keyword was anosmia smell or olfactory the full search strategy has been reported in table table 1
the articles that could not be obtained in the full text did not mention relationship between viral infection and olfactory function directly were not written in english and were the duplicated papers by the same author were excluded using endnote x9 software to date 23th april 2020 we could find 85 papers which mentioned viral infection and olfactory function among them 26 papers described relationship between olfactory symptoms and coronavirus infection including sars 40 papers described a relationship between olfactory symptoms and other viral infection including cytomegalovirus herpes virus influenza and othersfinally we could find 21 papers that directly described covid-19 and olfactory symptoms some of them also mentioned gustatory dysfunction or ageusia from these 21 papers 7 papers were clinical studies and others were commentary letters and editorial review fig 1
 the details of these 7 articles were demonstrated in table table 2
 a study reported patients who initially complained of acute onset anosmia not covid-19 infection but finally diagnosed with covid-19 infection 10there were no restrictions for gender age and nationality the studies with inclusion criteria were checked independently by 2 reviewers reviewers apply inclusion criteria based on the title and abstracts if the title and abstract were adequate the full text was checked by the same reviewersthe common symptoms in covid-19 patients were cough fever myalgia dyspnea headache and loss of appetite the most common ent symptoms were facial pain and nasal congestion 9however it has been recently reported that 339 of 59 covid-19 patients in italy complained of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction and 11 complained of both dysfunctions 11 47 of 114 covid-19 patients in france complained anosmia 12 3165 and 3544 of 79 covid-19 patients in spain complained olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions these proportions were more prominent in covid-19 patients than influenza patients 13 according to the paper from usa reported that 68 and 71 of 59 patients had olfactory and gustatory dysfunction respectively 14 98 of 60 patients from iran were confirmed smell dysfunction by university of pennsylvania smell identification test upsit 15 and few articles said that covid-19 patients without severe symptoms complained these olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions according to the larger-scale research from europe 856 of the 417 mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients had olfactory dysfunctions and 888 gustatory dysfunctions phantosmia and parosmia were 126 and 324 respectively among the patients who did not complain of nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea the rates of anosmia and hyposmia were 662 and 135 9 from the other italian article 644 of 202 mild symptomatic covid-19 patients were reported alternations in smell or taste about 37 of them complained severe alternations 683 of covid-19 patients with smell or taste alternations reported fatigue and 346 reported nasal stuffiness 16contrary to the above papers only 51 of 214 patients complained of hyposmia and 56 hypogeusia in china 8 considering the papers the rate of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is supposed to be different between europeusa and china or asiaanother issue is the onset of olfactory dysfunction which varied among many papers the onset of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in the clinical course of covid-19 might be important a multicenter study in europe showed that 856 and 88 of total patients n  417 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions respectively and 118 of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction appeared before other general symptoms 654 after the general symptoms and 228 at the same time 9 in italy 203 of covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction before other general symptoms and 135 during hospitalization 11 from the other study of italy 119 of covid-19 patients n  130 complained of smell or taste alternations prior to other symptoms and 267 after other symptoms 16 in iran 83 of 23 covid-19 patients with anosmia complained of anosmia as their primary symptom 17 in spain 355 among 31 covid-19 patients complained early and 677 showed acute onset of olfactory dysfunction 13however according to another study from iran all of 21 covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction with or immediately after the other general symptoms 15 in case of sars-cov infection complete anosmia was usually reported 3 weeks after the first symptom 18the other issue is the correlation of olfactory dysfunctions with otolaryngologic symptoms the olfactory dysfunction is not closely correlated with nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea but it is supposed to be related to fever 9 in china only 4 of patients with olfactory dysfunction complained of rhinorrhea 19 and only 5 nasal stuffiness 20 from the recent survey study of 2428 patients with new onset anosmia in united kingdom 17 of anosmia patients had only anosmia without any other otolaryngologic symptoms however this survey has limited value because only 80 patients had been tested for covid-19 infection only 74 of the tested patients were positive and most of the responders were young 10from a case report olfactory dysfunction was described as isolated sudden onset anosmia because a patient with confirmed covid-19 complained of sudden onset anosmia without any other symptoms 21 according to the other study from italy 3 of covid-19 patients n  130 reported smell or taste alternations as the sole symptom 16 however there is also an article reporting that ent symptoms can be accompanied by anosmia 12in korea korean center for disease control kcdc recently on 6 april 2020 announced in a press release that proportion of asymptomatic case was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation of covid-19 10284 confirmed as positive among 466804 tested in republic of korea until 6 april 2020 22there is a study showing that most of gustatory dysfunction appeared as an early symptom before hospitalization 11 besides there might be close correlation between olfactory and gustatory dysfunction p0001 9 considering above around 2030 covid-19 patients may present olfactory dysfunction andor gustatory dysfunction as early or sometimes isolated symptom of covid-19curiously many studies showed that women had olfactory dysfunction more frequently than men 9111217 though the reason is hard to be explained at this time according to a recent study toll-like receptor tlr activation with cytokine production and protein phosphorylation is related to x chromosomes this might explain different inflammatory conditions and clinical courses after infection between men and women 23 however from another study the results of upsit checked olfactory function were same between men and women 15 further investigations of gender difference are neededglobally particularly in europe the olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions of covid-19 patients were reported as new symptoms however to date many papers have reported that the olfactory dysfunction has also occurred by other viral infections over 200 different viruses 24 2526 furthermore coronavirus family including sars is also related to post-viral anosmia 18 although the exact mechanism is not yet known 2 basic mechanisms have been suggestedfirst conductive olfactory dysfunction can be induced if there are some problems on olfactory cleft mucosa such as mucosa inflammation or rhinorrhea 27 olfactory dysfunction in viral infection with rhinovirus parainfluenza epstein-barr viruses and some other coronavirus can be explained however in some cases even if the acoustic rhinometry result was normal the olfactory function did not recover 28 olfactory dysfunction of covid-19 patients is also thought to be less related to rhinorrhea or nasal congestionsecond if there are direct effects by virus on olfactory cleft mucosa sensorineural olfactory dysfunction can be considered 29 direct mucosal infection by virus can cause severe injury of peripheral olfactory neuron which might have fetal effects on olfactory receptors 30 also both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 might have the potential of microinvasion to the target receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is expressed on the olfactory bulb and the epithelial cell of oral mucosa 31 however the effects of virus on sensorineural olfactory dysfunction are controversial from one study it claims that sars-cov might affect neurons in the olfactory bulb of mice and spread to the cortex basal ganglia and midbrain 32 on the other hand there is another case report of the sars-cov patients presenting with anosmia showed normal on brain magnetic resonance imaging mri scan 18 there is also a case of covid-19 patient who showed the bilateral inflammatory mucosal obstruction of the olfactory cleft without other abnormalities in nasal cavity and olfactory bulb on computed tomographic scan ct and mri scan 33as mentioned earlier there are differences in the olfactory and otolaryngologic symptoms of chinese and european patients 19 and it might be due to the diversity and mutation of ace2 phenotypes 3435the validated tests which could quickly and accurately diagnose the olfactory dysfunction in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients are needed the short version of the questionnaire of olfactory disorders negative statements sqod-ns can be used to assess the quality of life of the covid-19 patients with anosmia or hyposmia 9 the score was significantly lower in patients with anosmia than hyposmia or normosmiabesides subjective questionnaires commonly used olfactory tests are as follows upsit cross-cultural smell identification test cc-sit sensonic inc haddon heights nj tt olfactometry test daiichi yakuhin sangyo tokyo japan and other olfactory threshold tests 36 recently few cases of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction were confirmed by upsit there was no correlation between upsit result and awareness of olfactory dysfunction in covid-19 patients 15also acoustic rhinometry rhinomanometry ct or mri could identify the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction mainly due to conductive problems and identify other causes however the usage of nasal endoscopy is not recommended in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients because it may provide other people unnecessary virus exposure 37in general spontaneous recovery rates have been reported higher in post-viral patients than post-traumatic patients and there are no definite treatment guidelines in the post-viral patients presenting with olfactory or gustatory dysfunction including covid-19 there are 2 issues on anosmia treatment in covid-19 patientsthe first issue is that early anomia treatment in covid-19 patients can change clinical course of covid-19 but due to lack of information this issue is hard to be answered but early detection appears more likely to be meaningful rather than early treatment for covid-19 the second one is whether empirical oral steroid treatment for acute anosmia can do harm to covid-19 patients without any other symptom or with mild symptomsup to date several studies have shown that oral steroid treatment for anosmia by viral infection may be effective through reducing mucosal inflammation and edema 38 there is a controversy over the effectiveness of the use of empirical systemic corticosteroids because oral steroids may aggravate immunosuppressive state in the covid-19 patients with severe symptoms and there are studies showing that use of corticosteroids in mers patients may have affected the delay of rna reduction in mers coronavirus 39moreover in cases of the covid-19 patients with severe lung complications the use of corticosteroids is not recommended by who guideline 40 in china however limited use of low dose corticosteroid during short-term can be permitted when absolutely necessary 41according to the recently released aria eaaci statement it is recommended to keep using intranasal steroid ins in the covid-19 patients with allergic rhinitis 40 although it may be revised later with new studies it is also recommended to maintain the use of local intranasal corticosteroids because sneezing could get worse and the virus could spread easily if the patients stop using insins is supposed to have relatively less risky than systemic steroids because the rate of systemic bioavailability of ins is less than 1 42 but further studies are needed to confirm if ins may be effective for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction and for the change of clinical course in the covid-19 patientsit was reported that the treatments used for olfactory dysfunction were nasal saline irrigations 167 nasal corticosteroids 81 oral corticosteroids 25 and others 25 however in actual clinical field most of the patients with olfactory dysfunction did not receive any treatment 9olfactory training simple and easy can bring positive results on the recovery for anosmia by viral infection but there is no definite guideline for olfactory training in the covid-19 patients but a few papers recommend that early olfactory training before 12 months from the onset of anosmia could have positive results in the patients with anosmia and viral infection including covid-19 3743besides steroid and olfactory training zinc sulfate theophylline ginkgo biloba vitamins nasal decongestants or other medicine could also be considered to treat olfactory dysfunction saline washing nasal saline irrigation should be considered carefully because it could make virus more contagious 9 however except for the corticosteroid the effects of other medicine have not been proven 37most of the patients with gustatory dysfunction did not have any special treatment either using l-carnitine or vitamins 9the recovery of olfactory function is relatively slower in sensorineural dysfunction than conductive olfactory dysfunction and permanent functional loss might be caused 21there are a few studies for the recovery of olfactory function in covid-19 infected patients yet in usa 74 of 38 cured patients from covid-19 were reported to show the recovery of anosmia 14 in france mean duration of anosmia was within 2 weeks and 55 of 44 patients recovered more after 1week and 20 recovered more after 2 weeks in spain mean duration of anosmia was also within 2 weeks and 40 of 30 patients recovered completely around 1 week later 74  23 days 13 according to the study from europe a total of 357 patients 856 had olfactory dysfunction from a total of 417 covid-19 infected patients but among 59 clinically cured patients only 44 is reported to show the recovery of olfactory function in short term period within 14 days most of whom 726 of patients with recovered olfactory dysfunction showed a recovery within 8 days only a small number of patients 34 showed a recovery more than 15 days after the covid-19 resolution among the clinically cured patients who had residual olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction 539 complained of only olfactory dysfunction 225 only gustatory dysfunction and 236 both remaining olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions 9the time to decide the recovery of olfactory function was suggested to be 2 weeks because the viral loading significantly reduces in about 14 days 944 but the further study requires to decide the time to recovery and follow up long term laterconsidering from the other viral infections the partial or complete recovery of olfactory function could take several months 45 and in case of anosmia after sars the patient was reported to suffer from anosmia continuously more than 2 years 18the ongoing covid-19 epidemic is still rapidly spreading all over the world so it is very important to notice the early sign of covid-19 and get the information about progression as soon as possible most of covid-19 patients complain of no symptoms or mild symptoms in early stages though coughing fever and difficulty breathing are main symptomsup to date the number of the covid-19 patients with olfactory andor gustatory symptoms is rapidly increasing and though the onset of olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the covid-19 patients was reported varied in general most of these 2 symptoms might precede or be accompanied by other main mild general symptoms or no other symptoms 16 moreover many cases 182 have been reported for the covid-19 patients to complain of these 2 symptoms suddenly without any other otolaryngologic symptoms like rhinorrhea or nasal obstructions 9based on the previous paper the rates of asymptomatic cases out of all sars-cov positive cases were reported 13 among singaporean health care workers 46 furthermore according to who report for mers-cov 21 of the 2228 cases from all over the world were reported to have no or mild symptoms 47asymptomatic case proportion of covid-19 was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation which was higher than sars-cov and mers-cov according to kcdc report on 6 april 2020 22therefore we should pay more attention to olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the suspicious covid-19 patients with or without the main covid-19 symptoms because asymptomatic covid-19 infection andor transmission is a major public health issue at present however the exact rate of asymptomatic covid-19 all over the world has not known and further analysis should be doneeven though the pathophysiologic mechanism of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions in covid-19 patients has not been clearly identified yet it is also very interesting that the clinical manifestations of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions were different according to gender or racesmoreover it is necessary to follow the clinical course and the long-term results of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in the cured covid-19 patientsalthough there is still a lack of our understanding of covid-19 the number of covid-19 patients is rapidly increasing all over the world based on the recent reports and studies sudden olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions may be the early signs of covid-19 though all olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions are not caused only by covid-19 even at present therefore if there are any persons complaining of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in covid 19 pandemic areas it is suggested that accurate and urgent diagnostic test for covid-19 should be applied by doing so health providers can get an opportunity to prepare personal protective equipment in advance and isolate the suspected asymptomatic patients or with mild symptom to prevent the further spread of covid-19the authors have no financial conflicts of interestsince december 2019 a pneumonia infection broke out in wuhan hubei province and spread in entire china and many other countries chinese health authorities observed notoriously a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology1 relations between the key cases and the citys south china sea food market were found the chance of another zoonosis or severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak was at the top of the priority investigations were attempted that result in recognition of a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 formerly 2019-ncov as the agent has entered as international outbreak in hubei china has revealed total of 72528 confirmed cases on february 17 20202

3 the novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 has spread across 210 nations and regions with 12 million confirmed cases and 67594 deaths noted on april 6 2020 the who declared public health emergency at international level the worldwide community gets worried about covid-19 and its impact on public health who is trying to control the impact of pandemic through identification testing treatment of patients clinical trials for drugs and development of new vaccines4 in india first case of covid 19 was reported on january 30 2020 who returned from wuhan china considering the first case as a matter of great worry screening of traveller at airport has been started immediate chinese visas have been cancelled and people who were found affected from covid-19 had been quarantined5 the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw of india had primarily warned to avoid travelling to china and quarantine of those returning from china6 however india is at high risk being the second highest populated country in the world most of the studies show the prediction of covid 19 through modeling for growth of infected population in the absence of a licensed vaccine or effective therapeutics for covid-19 other advises from hand cleanliness to quarantine a basic strategy to control spread of epidemic and alleviation mediation towards the early detection and quarantine of cases can break the chain of transmission the sars-cov-2 pandemic is currently a great challenge for researchers clinicians health-care workers and decision makers we depict the most striking difficulties for statisticians who need to provide support in this pandemic with their proficiency having a knowledge of the dynamics of case load rate and recovery rate of covid-19 can enhance the basic understanding to a large extent based on the current patterns of the severity of the epidemic as covid-19 cases are increasing day-by-day case load rate will be of utmost importance in predicting the declination of the epidemic in this article we want to predict the exact date when the recovery rate of patients would be more than new confirmed cases in india this date is defined as disease declined datedata safety patients consent ethical approvals are essential in non-pandemic circumstance but there are administrative barriers to get access to clinical data pandemic circumstances need precise handling of these issues and should be examined on nationwide clinical data are extremely time-dependent and involve progressive statistical methods7 data has been obtained with parameters as cumulative confirmed cases recovered cases and deaths from the online websites httpsdatahubiocorecovid-19resource-covid-19zip total 216919 cumulative confirmed cases 104107 recovered cases and 6075 deaths were found till date 04 june2020 and included in the studythe whole analysis has been carried out with data available on cumulative confirmed cases recovered cases and number of deaths recovery rate is defined as the proportion of number of recovered cases to total confirmed cases while the case load rate is defined as the proportion of case load to confirmed cases following formulae have been used for estimation purpose in table 1

total 2169191 confirmed cases and 104107 recovered cases were involved in the study recovery rate had been estimated as 4799 on the basis of confirmed and recovered cases total case load was found to be 106737 cases and case load rate was estimated as 4921 death rate was obtained as 280 based on 6075 dead patients delta being the difference of case load rate and recovery rate was obtained as 121 on june 04 2020 as evident from table 1 the value of delta has been estimated from january 30 2020 to june 04 2020 it has been predicted that the value of delta would be least on june 12 2020 it means the difference between cases load rate and recovery rate would approach a negligible value this indicates that confirmed cases expected would start to decline thereafter with respect to recovered cases as shown in fig 1
2019-ncov is a new coronavirus which is unique in relation to sars infections and has never been found in the human population afore8 the cases caused by 2019-ncov has evidently confirmed strong relational correspondence ability and the population is usually vulnerable9 this study deals with the estimation of the recovery rate and case load rate in india the impact might be decreased with the prevention and control actions implemented by the indian government the results of this study suggest that actively adopting a containment strategy will continue to increase the control of the epidemic in india lockdown quarantine and clinical perception and suspected cases will reduce the incidence and imposing restriction on population movement complete lockdown will help to reduce the risk of covid 19 in india10 explicitly various kinds of model have been utilized by the investigators keeping in view the main objective for which the model has been created with conclusion the cumulative confirmed cases and evolving reports of better understanding and better expectation of the imminent estimates from other nations have resulted in emerging mathematical tools for forecast the validity of different preventive and management policies some of these predicting models have suggested useful insights and supported policy decisions11 in india initially the recovery rate has been decreasing till date april 10 2020 with some peaks in between after that it is approximately increasing with its maximum value of 4799 as of june 04 2020 this finding suggests that lockdown strategy has played a great role in retarding the spread of the disease similarly case load rate is inconsistent in starting till april 10 2020 after that it is continuously decreasing and is least as of june 04 2020 having a value of 4921 which shows that lockdown 2 and subsequent lockdowns have greatly contributed in reducing the risk of epidemic in this article proposed models have resulted in findings regarding the recovery rate and case load rate associated with covid-19 disease with application of statistics estimates of delta have been used for prediction purposeinvestigation has been made on the issue of covid-19 pandemic spread in india in the current challenging scenario trend knowledge has been observed with the help of recovery rate and case load rate obtained for the data available the various strategies implemented as lockdown quarantine of population have played a significant role in reducing the risk of spread of epidemic this study predicts that when the cases load rate gets lesser than recovery rate there after covid-19 patients would start to declinethis study is restricted within the time period of analysis till june 04 2020 in india different models were considered to estimate covid-19 extent and claimed to be precise however they critically revealed data gaps and prerequisite to adjust difficult variables such as effect and uncertainty of lockdown risk factors and social distancing might be reflected before generalizing the findingsthe authors did not receive any funding for this workthe authors declare no conflict of interesthuman coronaviruses hcovs were first identified in the 1960s many hcovs have been identified since then including those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome 1 two conditions that cause fatal respiratory diseases in humans after infection coronaviruses coves of the coronaviridae family are enveloped viruses with a single-strand positive-sense rna genome having the largest known rna virus genome 1 2 in humans cov infections mainly involve the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts causing various symptoms ranging from a mild self-limited disease such as common cold to the more severe manifestations such as bronchitis and pneumonia 3 in 1965 the first human coronavirus hcv was isolated from the nasal discharge of common cold patients 4 infected patients with the novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 demonstrated clinical manifestations with extreme pneumonia and increased mortality rates currently there is no definite andor effective treatment for covid-19 5 sun et al in their latest publication expressed the possible interaction of covid-19 and ace2 which may result in the degradation of ace2 and the blockage of the pathway to the receptor by ace2ang 17mas receptor 6 the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been proposed as probable beneficial treatments for covid-19 insinuating the ras system as an important target for the treatment of lung diseases 5comparing the occurrence of the disease in different geographical areas having genetically diverse ethnicities can provide a scientific foundation for future researches to implement protocols on covid-19 treatment considering the quick advent of the coronavirus disease and the current data shortfall on the virus pathophysiologythe event rate for the number of positive cases of coronavirus and its associated death rates for each country was extracted from the who website the inclusion criteria for the countries were as follows a at least 14 days incubation time-lapse from first detected covid-19 case in the country b more than 1000 detected cases of covid-19 and c availability of studies reporting id polymorphism in the countryto evaluate the coronavirus prevalence based on its association with the reninangiotensin system studies reporting the prevalence of ace id polymorphism in each country were collected to estimate the pooled id ratio considering the systematic studies and meta-analysis reporting system prisma statement to select the studies reporting ace id polymorphism prevalence isi pubmed scopus and google scholar databases were searched with keywords such as ace gene polymorphism id and the name of each country from the year 1990 to 2020 three researchers simultaneously searched for the published articles if previous meta-analyses were available in any particular country the same study was referred to in the first step 1399 studies were evaluated based on their titles and after excluding 84 duplicated studies 154 studies were also excluded due to their irrelevance in the full-text review of the selected articles 431 were excluded as a result of the study having been conducted either in a false study region or not having healthy controls or not reporting id polymorphism the main inclusion criterion was providing the general prevalence of ace id polymorphism in the healthy population finally 116 articles were used for data extraction the dataset of i and d allele frequency in the healthy control group of each study was extracted data were analyzed based on the random-effects model using the comprehensive meta-analysis software version 2 i2 indices were used to determine the heterogeneity between studies as the i2 index of pooled id allele frequency ratio was 99 random-effects models were used the inverse method was also applied to estimate the variance and weight for each study the bias of publication was assessed by eggers regression interceptto assess the pooled id allele frequency

relationship between ace id allele frequency and the covid-19 recovery rate also this study showed that the ace id allele ratio is very diverse worldwide east asian countries such as china and japan all had a ratio of more than 1 showing a higher rate of i allele frequency in east asia there appeared to be more i-alleles than d in the population genome of the people however south korea has an allele ratio of 087 which is still much higher than in european countries these findings are consistent with studies of ace id genetic mappingsimilar to our report saab et al examined the average ace ii genotype frequency in healthy subjects in different populations of different countries 6 they disclosed that ace i allele and genotype frequencies show an association with longitude a regional analysis perpetrated a strong correlation between ii genotype frequency and longitude indicated by a decrease in the ii frequency from europe toward the middle east and an alternate east-bound rise toward asia summarily the average frequency of the ii genotype in the north of europe and denmark was 23 while the uk and spain recorded 20 and 15 whereas northern and southern italy registered 14 and 12 with china and japan averaging 35 and 45 respectively 6 also this finding was confirmed in our study as denmark had an ace id ratio of 101 which was higher than in other european countries the interesting finding of saab et als study about the lowest ii genotypes of europe in italy makes us think about a possible role of genetic factors and the tragedy of the covid-19 outbreak in italy with a high case-fatality rate 7 european countries like italy spain and the uk have been widely affected by covid-19 it is well known that ace i allele frequency in europe is lower than in east asia as seen in our study which indicated the average ace id allele ratio in europe as 055 while it was 093 in the whole of asia this finding confirms the results of wang et als study as they estimated the average ace insertion frequency in east asia to be 063 and 043 in europe 8the diversity in the mode of disease dissemination in different regions can be attributed to a large number of genetic and environmental influences and this has led researchers to investigate the possible interconnection between environmental influences such as weather with the covid-19 pandemic 9 noteworthy is the fact that whereas the synthetic temperature factor has been positively associated with d allele synthetic humidity factor and d allele are negatively linked in terms of global regional spread and interdependence between these two factors and the d allele assumes an out of africa expansion pattern in space 10 per our results regarding the ace id ratio li et al had shown that the highest frequency of d allele appears in africa europe america and the arab regions whereas the lowest frequency is located in east asia based on their study usa is located in a relative high frequency of d allele 10 which was confirmed by our study and this high d allele frequency may be associated with bad outcomes of covid-19 in this countryresearchers have suggested that the virus binds to the ace2 receptor on the surface of human cells through its envelope spike glycoprotein and enters the cell 11 on the other hand in the study of monteil et al it was found that human recombinant soluble ace2 could block sars-cov-2 cell attachment 12 a comprehensive review by fan et al underscored the close relationship between ace2 and ace through which ace2 regulates ras exhibiting a greater than 40 identity with the somatic ace catalytic domain 13 still in the perspective of ace cao et al evaluated the allele frequency of 62 variants in the coding regions of ace2 in different populations despite demonstrating the predisposition of the ace2 gene polymorphism in different populations worldwide they however could not pinpoint any specific evidence to confirm the presence of the ace2 binding-resistant coronavirus s-protein mutants in various populations 14 also not all lung tissue cells expressed ace2 and its expression was concentrated in some type ii alveolar cells 15 cao et al found specific polymorphisms associated with higher ace2 expression in the east asian population 14 in our study the highest id allele ratio was seen in china and japan in east asia this similarity reinforces the idea of the populations difference in the ras system that may predispose them to a divergent susceptibility to the diseasewhile the genetic predisposition of the ace genes in covid-19 patients has not yet been examined the relationship between other respiratory diseases and the ace genotype has been investigated in various studies in one study that investigated the relationship between the ace genotype and the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome it was found that the frequency of dd genotype of patients was significantly higher than that of healthy controls 16 this conforms with our finding which demonstrates that with the increase of the id allele ratio i allele increases or d allele decreases the recovery rate increases hence it is not surprising to see a higher recovery rate in east asian countries such as japan point estimate 118 ci 95 106 to 13 china point estimate 117 ci 95 114 to 121 and s korea point estimate 087 ci 95 081094 p  00001 due to the high id allele ratio in the population as expected the worst-hit european countries like spain point estimate 04 ci 95 037042 italy point estimate 049 ci 95 047051 and uk point estimate 066 ci 95 065 to 068 p  00001 all have low id allele ratio from the forest plot analysis also in another study the researchers found that the d allele had a role in the progression of noninfectious pulmonary dysfunction 17that notwithstanding this study is restricted by the varied known and unknown factors affecting the global recovery and death rate of covid-19 patients including demographic characteristics such as patients sex age underlying diseases and the various approaches used to treat patients in the different regions these data were not yet publicly available worldwide to be considered in our study besides the utilization of official numbers of covid-19 infected people are biased by the number of correct diagnoses that are carried out in each country and this might consequently affect the recovery and death ratesdespite the limitations cited above our result demonstrating the positive correlation of the id ace gene allele ratio with the recovery rate of covid-19 patients presents a hypothesis worth considering for further studies we suggest case-control studies to assess the role of the definitive ace gene polymorphism on treatment outcomes the importance of our finding is rooted in the possibility that these genetic variations may cause different responses to the covid-19 treatments focusing on the ras system components which are currently being investigated in experimental studiescoronaviruses have been increasingly recognised as a human public health issue following the emergence of high-impact zoonotic diseases from bats  the mammalian order that hosts the largest diversity of coronaviruses 1 examples include the coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which claimed 916 lives out of 8422 cases from november 2002 to august 2003 2 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers which has claimed 608 lives out of 1449 cases as of 31 august 2016 3 sars-like coronaviruses sl-cov are maintained in bats 4 and mers coronavirus mers-cov is assumed to have originated in bats 5 the findings that genetically diverse sl-cov strains share high similarity with sars coronavirus sars-cov and that bats harbour diverse coronaviruses which can be classified to the same coronavirus species as mers-cov suggest that recurrent coronavirus epidemics and pandemics in humans are likely 6 genetic analyses of coronaviruses in bats suggested that the diversity of coronaviruses in bats may provide further opportunities for spillover into other species 7 mitigation of spillover of the viruses is based on understanding of the maintenance mechanism of multihost viruses in reservoir hostsbats may have idiosyncratic immune responses allowing them to be infected with no signs of disease with viruses that are highly pathogenic in other species 8 this feature of bats may contribute to their ability to host zoonoses including sars mers ebola marburg nipah and hendra viruses a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this some authors suggest that bats ability to fly induces fever helping to control viruses 9 others suggest that immune system adaptation allows tolerance of intracellular pathogens 10 and that co-evolution during a long history between specific viruses and bat hosts results in no pathogenicity to bats whereas recent host shifts from bats to other mammals result in high fatality rates 11 12two conditions must be met for bats to be reservoir hosts of emerging infectious diseases first the ability to maintain pathogens in their populations and second the ability to transmit those pathogens to another species this paper concentrates on the first of these conditions features that may contribute to viral maintenance in bat populations include 1 a metapopulation structure that avoids viral extinction across the total population via sub-populations which allow reinfection through movement 13 14 2 reduced metabolism during hibernation that facilitates viral survival 15 and 3 persistent infections with chronic shedding or intermittent recrudescence 16 17 this study focuses on the feature of persistent infection persistent infections of sars-cov in vitro studies support the plausibility of persistent infections of coronaviruses in bats 18 19 in persistent infections a virus is not cleared from the host but remains associated with specific cells for a long period regardless of the mechanisms operating within hosts persistent infection contributes to viral maintenance within populations and has been considered as a mechanism of viral maintenance in reservoir hosts of other emerging infectious diseases 20this study is based on data obtained in a previously reported capturemarkrecapture cmr study 21 of a maternal roost of myotis macropus this microbat microchiroptera also known as large-footed myotis is widely distributed in australia 22 m macropus inhabits areas close to waterways in small groups 21 foraging on aquatic invertebrate and small fish 22 the bats in the study region form maternity roosts biannually in october and january and deliver single young 21 gestation and lactation periods are 12 and 8 weeks respectively 21smith undertook a cmr study of m macropus in the lifting holes of a bridge in southeast queensland australia supplementary table s1 21 full details of the methodology are described in the original study 21 briefly the cmr data of 52 australian bats m macropus were collected during nine capturing occasions over 12 weeks from 13 january to 31 march 2009 which overlapped with the january breeding season and subsequent lactation period for this species 21 coronavirus rna was detected in faecal pellets or anal swabs using rtpcr reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting a conserved region of a coronavirus gene 21 of the 52 unique individuals 42 were recaptured at least once and of these 7 16 and 19 bats respectively showed multiple detections a single detection and no detection of coronavirus rna table 1 the data from bats with multiple detections of coronavirus rna were suggestive of persistent infections 21 the cmr dataset are unusual and particularly valuable in that the data contain individual tracking records with infection states longitudinal sampling of individual bats is necessary to explore persistent infection and to test whether persistent infection is a possible viral maintenance mechanism in a bat population for many bats large population size and migratory behaviour have impeded obtaining individual data most field studies have therefore been cross-sectional 14 23 24 rather than following individuals through time limiting development of understanding the maintenance mechanism of bat-borne viruses
here we apply quantitative analyses in a bayesian framework to the cmr data from smith 21 to derive parameter estimates for epidemic models to investigate the effects of persistent infection on viral maintenance in a bat populationwe analysed the cmr data using multistate models to estimate survival rates  recapture rates p and transition rates  fig 1 the multistate models included two states infectious and non-infectious with transitions in both directions 25 each time step was a week in addition to investigate persistent infection in the bat population we explored multistate models in which bats were divided into two groups based on the frequency of coronavirus rna detection recaptured bats with a single detection were referred to as transiently infectious bats and recaptured bats with multiple detections were referred to as persistently infectious bats bats that were only captured once were excluded from analysis table 1 five bats were once captured with a single detection of coronavirus rna and those five bats were excluded from two groups
to analyse the cmr data we chose a bayesian method over a frequentist approach because the bayesian method is more appropriate in dealing with a small amount of data relying less on large sample asymptotic approximations 26 the bayesian analyses were conducted in r 27 and in openbugs using the r package r2openbugs 28 openbugs was used to run three independent chains of an mcmc markov chain monte carlo sampler for 10 000 iterations each after discarding the initial 1000 samples as a burn in the mean of each of the parameters was calculated as were the 25th and 975th percentiles of the parameter distributions 95 bayesian credible intervals cri the relevant r code is provided as supplementary material r code s1 and s2we used cmr multistate model selection to determine whether grouping of persistently and transiently infectious bats and the inclusion of infectious and non-infectious states were supported by the cmr data the grouping and the multiple states were applied to survival recapture and transition rates of the cmr data comparisons between the candidate multistate models were assessed with deviance information criterion dic 29 and the most parsimonious model was selected for subsequent simulated epidemic modelssurvival rates  were used to calculate mortality rates  transition rates  from the infectious to non-infectious state ui were used to calculate infectious period which is a reciprocal of recovery rate  table 2 failure to detect coronavirus rna in faeces or anal swabs may not necessarily imply recovery from the infection and could conceivably represent intermittent viral excretion or false-negative laboratory results however recovery from sars coronavirus infection in humans has been shown to occur when virus is no longer detected in faecal samples 30 in the absence of specific information about recovery from coronavirus infection in these bats we assumed that failure to detect coronavirus in faecal samples or anal swabs similarly corresponded to recovery
the transmission rate  could not be directly calculated from the cmr data analyses and was instead calculated from basic reproduction number r0 equations from drexler et als study 14 and from observation of the cmr data 21 smith 21 hypothesised that the initial epidemic peak was caused by the formation of a maternity roost of m macropus from weeks 1 to 6 and that a second epidemic peak after parturition was caused by newborn pups who lost their passive immunity from weeks 6 to 12 thus with an assumption that a new epidemic began from week 7 we used an equation of r0  1  d 31 where  represents the growth rate in an epidemic and d represents the average duration of the infectious period we calculated  as 03328 per week by using the cmr data from weeks 7 to 12 supplementary figure s1 we estimated mean d as 17737 weeks from the infectious period of recaptured bats 1 table 2 thus we estimated r0 to be 15903 we estimated  using r0  nd where n is the total population size 31 by assuming that n was 86 the mean estimated size of the study population 21 we could calculate  00104 a rate of waning immunity  was unable to be estimated from this cmr data and has not been estimated in other studies in the absence of data to suggest otherwise we assumed the rate of waning immunity was comparable to that in human sars-cov infections 30 uncertainty in parameter values was included by sampling mortality and recovery rates from pert distributions using the r package mc2d 32we built a deterministic density-dependent susceptibleinfectiousrecoveredsusceptible sirs model using ode ordinary differential equations we assumed that density dependence was appropriate for a coronavirus because sars-cov is transmitted in bats via a faecaloral route which is more suggestive of density-dependent transmission than frequency-dependent transmission 33 34 and that sars infection in humans has been modelled with density-dependent transmission 35 36 further the number of bats in the roost was relatively small and this would allow homogenously mixed contacts among bats 21 we used a sirs model for coronavirus infection in bats following previous authors who have used sirs models for coronavirus infection in miniopterus spp 21 additionally high sars-cov seroprevalence in bats supports the existence of a recovered class 4 in the cmr data positive detections of coronavirus rna occasionally encompassed negative detections and negative detections occasionally encompassed positive detections implying that infectiousness and non-infectiousness were not permanent 21to test effects of grouping of bats into persistently infectious and transiently infectious bats on the probability of viral persistence in the bat population we designed two alternative models a one-group model and a two-group model fig 2 the one-group model did not differentiate between persistently infectious and transiently infectious states instead assumed that all recaptured bats n  23 with multiple or single detection of coronavirus rna in the cmr data had the same recovery and mortality rates regardless of the number of coronavirus rna detections on the other hand the two-group model split bats into persistently infectious and transiently infectious groups we assumed that recaptured bats with multiple detection of coronavirus rna were persistently infectious n  7 and recaptured bats with single detection of coronavirus rna in the cmr data were transiently infectious n  16 given the multistate model selection preferred the inclusion of the multistate effect table 3 we estimated different mortality rates for infectious bats i class and non-infectious bats s and r classes

in the one-group model the mean prevalence p  02786 of coronavirus in the cmr data was used to set the initial number of infectious bats in the model with the population size n  86 and the remaining bats were considered susceptible s  1pn i  pn r  0 in the two-group model the initial number of infectious bats was set based on the proportion of persistently infectious bats in infectious bats out of recaptured bats in the cmr data f  723 s  1pn ip  fpn it  1fpn and r  0six scenarios were set up based on different infectious periods scenario 1 was developed to describe the dynamics of coronavirus infection in m macropus without grouping bats based on infectious period the one-group model scenarios 26 were two-group models scenario 2 was developed to describe the dynamics when bats were grouped into persistently infectious and transiently infectious bats and scenarios 36 were modifications of scenario 2 with extended periods of persistent infection while we used the infectious periods calculated from the cmr data analyses in scenarios 1 and 2 we assumed extended infectious period of persistently infectious bats to 5 7 9 and 11 weeks in scenario 36 respectively following a previous study in which m macropus could be identified with a putative novel alphacoronavirus infection for up to 11 weeks 21we simulated the model with 10 000 iterations sampling from the range of parameter values calculated from the cmr data and estimated the probability of viral persistence in the population of m macropus the r package desolve 37 was used to build the epidemic model time steps were weekly following the time interval of the cmr data 21 see supplementary material r code s3 we assumed that the virus persisted in the population when at least one infectious bat remained at week 12the multistate models enabled estimation of survival and recapture rates of m macropus and transition rates between infectious and non-infectious states table 2 the survival rates were relatively constant during the period whereas the recapture rates generally decreased in the first half and increased in the second half of capturing occasions fig 1a as a result the transition rates should be considered with caution when recapture rate was low for example only one bat was captured at the fifth recapturing occasion fig 1b paucity of the cmr data resulted in wide error barsthe most parsimonious model supported grouping of bats into two groups based on the detection frequency of coronavirus rna single and multiple detections for all three rates of survival recapture and transition there was little support for multistate effects on the survival rate dic  02 comparing models 1 and 2 table 3 this was in accordance with previous findings that coronavirus infection in bats showed no signs of illness 7 8 the results of model selection processes also indicated that the multistate effect should be excluded for recapture rate and should be intrinsically considered for transition ratethe sirs epidemic models were simulated to generate the probabilities of coronavirus persistence in a bat population in the six scenarios the simulated probability of viral persistence in scenario 2 two-group model 05210 was somewhat higher than the probability in scenario 1 one-group model 04094 table 4 this result showed that viruses were more likely to be maintained in the bat population when bats could either be persistently infectious or transiently infectious than when bats were not split into these groups as the period of persistent infection was lengthened to 5 weeks in scenario 3 the probability of persistence within the population reached to almost 1 in scenario 46 in which the periods of persistent infection were lengthened to 7 9 and 11 weeks respectively the virus persisted in the population in every simulation although smith 21 found that m macropus can be identified with a putative novel alphacoronavirus infection over periods of up to 11 weeks extension of the period of persistent infection from about 3 weeks scenario 2 to 5 weeks scenario 3 markedly increased the probability of viral maintenance to almost one
this study analysed cmr data of a species of australian bats m macropus with a putative novel alphacoronavirus infection in order to decide whether it is appropriate to divide bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats and to determine whether viral maintenance is improved by the differentiation of bats into these groups grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats was supported by the cmr multistate model selection processes table 3 by exploring various scenarios in epidemic models we found that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous bats were either transiently or persistently infectious table 4 in addition to a previous study that suggested persistent infection of coronavirus in bats in north america through the small number of bats sampled 23 our study provides much validity by using larger number of bats sampled 21 although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimatesfurther understanding of the potential and likelihood of within-host persistent infections is important to understand spillover of bat-borne viruses persistent infections contribute not only in maintaining viruses in a population but also in triggering pulses of virus shedding temporally synchronised stressors such as food shortage and reproduction may weaken the immune system of bats facilitating persistent infections in infectious bats 38 thus those temporally synchronised stressors can cause viral shedding from persistently infectious bats during a limited period leading to pulses of viral shedding because spillover of bat-borne viruses has been associated with pulses of viral shedding from bats 38 the finding of persistent infection in bats contributes in understanding spillover mechanisms of bat-borne virusesmaternity roosts were assumed to play an important role in maintaining coronavirus at the population level 24 in coronavirus transmission within a population of myotis an epidemic peak was observed at the formation of the maternity colony and another peak was observed as newborn pups lost their passive immunity 14 transmission of viruses during the breeding season is more readily facilitated compared with other times due to frequent contact among individuals within a maternity roost 14 21 39 fluctuating recapture rates and coronavirus prevalence are presumed to be related to the changing ethology of bats during the breeding season therefore cmr data covering both breeding seasons and non-breeding seasons are required to investigate how coronaviruses can be maintained in a bat population even if maternal roosts do not facilitate viral transmissionthese findings need to be treated with some caution because the low sample size limits our confidence in the results of modelling for example the recapture rates were markedly different from recapturing occasion to occasion fig 1a as only one bat was sampled at the fifth recapturing occasion 21 additionally the cmr data included only coronavirus rna detections without detections of coronavirus antibodies a sars coronavirus crude antigen elisa was not successful in detecting antibodies against the putative novel alphacoronavirus in these bats 21 thus the lack of seroprevalence in the cmr data limited the accuracy of the estimated duration of recovery nevertheless the cmr data deserve intensive analyses because longitudinal sampling of individual bats for infectious diseases is difficult to achieve and allows estimation of epidemiological parameters the cmr study in smiths study 21 had relatively high recapture rates thanks to finding a lifting hole of a bridge where bats infected with coronavirus roosted with a high affinity to their colony fluctuating recapture rates across capturing occasions in the cmr data which might be associated with trap-shy and adaptive methods of capturing highlighted the difficulty of recapturing specific bats during the entire sampling periodpersistent infections have been hypothesised as a mechanism for viral persistence not only in coronaviruses 23 but also in other bat-borne viruses for example filoviruses and henipaviruses despite lack of direct evidence 20 it was also hypothesised that a small portion of super-long-shedder bats with a long infectious period could maintain hendra virus in a bat population 13 although further comprehensive datasets are needed to understand the effects of persistent infection this study shows the value of longitudinal individual data from bats with viral infections to elucidate transmission dynamics of bat-borne viruses underscoring the need of individual bat tracking data with infection states to improve our understanding of infection dynamics of bat-borne viruseson 31 december 2019 the who office in china was informed of a few cases of pneumonia of unknown cause originating from the city of wuhan hubei in china1 over the next 3 months the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 illness commonly called covid-19 has affected more than four million people globally with over 14 million cases in the usa itself making it the new epicentre of the illness followed by much of western europe the mortality rates from different parts of the world show vast differences but studies have consistently shown that the presence of comorbidities specially type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly increases mortality in patients with sars-cov-2 with an or of 28525 a study from china also showed that patients in the intensive care unit with sars-cov-2 infection were more likely to have underlying diabetes 222 vs 59 than others6 certain forms of hypophysitis thyroiditis and adrenalitis have viral aetiologies changes in endocrine functions observed during the previous coronavirus outbreak with sars-cov led to considerable morbidity and were important predictors of mortality therefore it is imperative to know the endocrinopathic impact of sars-cov-2 illness the purpose of this review is to highlight the available data on endocrine changes in such patients and to recapitulate the existing knowledge from previous coronavirus outbreaks for better risk stratification and management of patients with sars-cov-2 infectionall articles reporting endocrine changes in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov patients were considered electronic database of pubmed was searched using medical subject headings mesh terms related to sars-cov-2 sars-cov and different hormones since the sars-cov outbreak occurred in 2002 search results were limited to january 2002 onwards to consider articles pertaining to the outbreaks of both the viruses a considerable number of articles were in the chinese language and were included after being translated into english this was supplemented by handsearching reference lists for additional studies and case reports similarly google scholar database was handsearched studies listing type 2 diabetes mellitus as a risk factor of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were excluded since they did not mention any biochemical changes articles about corticosteroid induced hyperglycaemia audio interviews and articles detailing the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system raas inhibitors were excluded an initial search showed 1585 articles finally 17 of them were included figure 1a detailed histopathological study on the effects of sars infection on the thyroid gland was done during the sars-cov outbreak7 there was extensive injury of the parafollicular cells and follicular epithelium with the destruction and exfoliation of epithelial cells into the follicle leading to its disruption these changes were responsible for lower levels of thyroid hormones noted in clinical studies parafollicular cells are responsible for calcitonin production and they could not be identified on he sections in the tissue sample from patients with sars damage to interfollicular tissue including parafollicular cells may adversely affect calcitonin production an interesting finding was the absence of inflammatory infiltrate and features of cellular necrosis supporting the hypothesis of extensive apoptosis responsible for thyroid injurythe pathology data of the thyroid gland in patients with sars-cov-2 infection have been published by yao et al they conducted minimally invasive autopsies from different organs in patients who had died of sars-cov-2 and investigated the pathological changes8 they reported no abnormalities in the thyroid follicular morphology but did note lymphocytic infiltration in the interstitium none of the tissue immunohistochemistry and pcr analyses detected sars-cov-2 in the thyroid gland these findings are at variance with those reported in sars-cov though the patient characteristics in the two studies were nearly the same however irrespective of pathological findings most of the studies found a similar pattern of biochemical changeslimited data suggest that the thyroid gland and the hypothalamopituitarythyroid hpt axis are directly affected in sars-cov-2 illness a study of 274 patients with sars-cov-2 showed that thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and free triiodothyronine t3 concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients 07 miuml and 28 pmoll than in recovered patients 14 miuml and 43 pmoll the difference in the thyroxine t4 levels was not statistically significant9
a study by wang et al reported that serum levels of t3 and t4 in patients with sars-cov were significantly lower than those in the control group and low t3 levels correlated with disease severity serum t3 and t4 levels were decreased respectively in 94 and 46 of 48 patients with sars-cov during the acute phase and 90 and 38 during the convalescent phase of the disease10 the authors also noted lower levels of tsh in these patients dysfunction of the hpt axis caused a diminished level of serum tsh in patients with sars-cov despite low serum t3 and t4 no significant difference in serum parathyroid hormone level was observed between patients with sars-cov and the control group during the acute or convalescent phases of the illnesschanges in thyroid hormone levels may persist after clinical recovery leow et al studied sars-cov survivors for hormonal derangements 3 months after recovery and noted that 67 of the patients had developed biochemical hypothyroidism11 the majority of these patients 75 had a central aetiology and only 25 developed primary hypothyroidism with positive antibodies and continued to receive thyroid hormone replacement at the end of the study on follow-up changes in the thyroid profile of the patients with central hypothyroidism had normalised central hypocortisolism was also present in 66 of patients who had central hypothyroidism the authors suggested a dysfunctional hpt axis as evidenced by the results of thyroid hormones and the coexistence of central hypocortisolismthese studies suggest for the monitoring of thyroid function tests during acute illness as well as during convalescence of sars-cov-2 with the possibility of replacement therapy as indicated there were reports of recovery of thyroid function in 3 6 months in sars-cov patients implying reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic11
many viruses such as enteroviruses coxsackie b virus12 retroviruses rubella mumps cytomegalovirus epstein-barr and varicella zoster virus have been implicated in the development of diabetes mellitus in humans13
coronavirus has also been reported to cause diabetes in animal and human studies in a case report of a foal it was suggested that the pancreas could have had direct viral damage due to coronavirus leading to diarrhoea and transient diabetes mellitus simultaneously14
it has been demonstrated that coronaviruses enter human lungs pancreas and other tissues by interacting with the ace2 receptor the expression of ace2 is much stronger in pancreatic endocrine tissue compared with the exocrine tissue15 the extent of tissue damage by sars-cov is a direct function of the level of expression of tissue ace2 thus sars-cov viruses may damage pancreatic islets and cause acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus but not acute pancreatitisthe pancreatic biopsy findings in sars-cov-2 patients have been identical to the previous studies in sars-cov patients yao et al reported no obvious abnormalities in the epithelial cells in the exocrine pancreas however degeneration of a few islet cells was noted8
it was observed that patients with mild sars-cov who did not receive glucocorticoid medications during the disease course had a higher level of fasting plasma glucose fpg on the first day of hospitalisation than those who had non-sars pneumonia new-onset diabetes developed in 51 of sars-cov patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment during illness15 hyperglycaemia was an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in sars-cov patients with and without a history of diabetes mellitus4 yang et al demonstrated that before steroid treatment the mean fpg level was significantly higher in sars-cov patients deceased vs survivors vs non-sars pneumonia group 9752 vs 6530 vs 5110 mmoll p001 hyperglycaemia fpg70 mmoll before steroid treatment was significantly associated with death or 33 after adjustment for age and gender there was an incremental rise in mortality with increasing fpg another interesting association noted was between hypoxaemia and higher fpg levels4 among patients with no known history of diabetes and before the commencement of steroid therapy those who had hypoxaemia arterial oxygen saturation 93 had higher fpg levels than those who did not have hypoxia in both the survivor 8749 vs 6321 mmoll and deceased 9848 vs 7215 mmoll groups it was estimated that for every 10 mmoll increase in fpg the hr increased by 108-fold for death and 107-fold for hypoxia morbidity in both survivors and deceased patients irrespective of steroid dosage elevated fpg values started falling in the third week indicating gradual recovery of islet cell functionabout half a billion people are currently living with diabetes worldwide patients with diabetes had a poorer outcome in previous epidemics of sars-cov and h1n1 epidemics16 17 the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes and without other comorbidities was recently reported by guo et al from wuhan china18 patients with diabetes may present with milder symptoms initially but they were at higher risk of rapid progression to severe pneumonia uncontrolled cytokine storm and hypercoagulable state contributing to a poorer prognosis interleukin-6 il-6 level was found to be higher in sars-cov-2 cases with diabetes than those without diabetes wang et al hypothesised that sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes might trigger stress condition and increase secretion of hyperglycaemic hormones such as glucocorticoid and catecholamines resulting in elevated blood glucose abnormal glucose variability and diabetic complications in turn leading to higher mortality and morbidity rates in these patients19
a study of 99 sars-cov-2 patients demonstrated that 52 of patients had elevated blood glucose with a mean glucose value of 74 mmoll20 wu et al

to sum up sars-cov infections damage islet cells causing acute temporary diabetes high fpg and associated metabolic changes lead to increased morbidity and mortality in these patients in addition pre-existing diabetes may be considered a risk factor for poorer outcomes of sars-cov-2 pneumonia intensive blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy to obtain optimal metabolic control may improve the outcome of these patients tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 may have a role in patients with diabetes to control overexpressed il-6 it is being used off-label currently and a randomised controlled trial is testing its utility24 the european society of endocrinology statement advises patients with diabetes to avoid physician office visits and seek telephonicelectronic consultations for optimal control of blood sugar they need to get an early referral to emergency services in case of possible symptoms of sars-cov-225
the histological changes in adrenal glands of the patients dying from sars-cov were described by ding et al from postmortem biopsy samples26 they noted that the adrenal medulla had been infiltrated by mainly the monocytes and lymphocytes another interesting finding was the focal necrosis of the gland in addition vasculitis of the small veins of the adrenal medulla was present no similar studies have been conducted in sars-cov-2 patients until date however there are reasons to believe that similar adrenal gland changes could occur given the similarity of the viral structure and mechanism of entry into human host cellssars-cov genome sequences have been detected in the cytoplasm of numerous neurons in the hypothalamus and cortex27 it might induce either hypophysitis or directly affect the hypothalamus leading to hypothalamicpituitary dysfunction leow et al
11 studied hypocortisolism in patients who had recovered from sars-cov patients with an intact hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis at the time of acquiring sars-cov were included in the study these patients also had symptoms like lethargy malaise lassitude fatigue weakness orthostatic dizziness anorexia apathy anxiety and depression after recovery three months after recovery 393 of patients had hypocortisolism of which 833 had central hypocortisolism as depicted by low adrenocorticotropic hormone acth levels it was interesting to note that the majority of these patients had not received any systemic glucocorticoids as part of the treatment for sars ruling out the possibility of hpa axis suppression by exogenous corticosteroid use the hypocortisolism was however transient and resolved in 625 of patients within a year with an average duration of 5931 months these patients also reported resolution of symptoms including orthostatic hypotension in comparison to the start of the study six patients 25 continued with residual hypocortisolism at 1-year follow-up and one of them still required hydrocortisone replacement a quarter of the patients also revealed transient biochemical thyroid changes with some patients developing both a central hypothyroid and hypoadrenal state with the hpa axis affected more frequently than the hpt axis the authors also found low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate dheas in 131 patients after adjusting for age sex and menopausal status dheas replacement could further ameliorate symptoms in those with dheas deficiencyfindings from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 patients suggest for actively monitoring biochemical changes like serum cortisol and acth shall these biochemical changes go unnoticed it may complicate post-sars recovery symptomatic patients with orthostatic hypotension may require physiological doses of hydrocortisone replacement until hpa axis recovery in addition patients with adrenal insufficiency and cushings syndrome are at increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection and should adhere to enhanced preventive stepschanges in the cells of anterior pituitary were noted in biopsy samples of sars-cov patients28 on immunohistochemical staining the number of somatotrophs thyrotrophs and corticotrophs was reduced while the number of lactotrophs and gonadotrophs was significantly increased these findings correlated with biochemical abnormalities of increased prolactin luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in sars-cov reported earlier in chinese literatureseasonal and the h1n1 influenza a virus h1n1 pandemic have been associated with increased severity and greater risk of morbidity and mortality in obese persons compared with normal weight persons being overweight and obesity both negatively impact cellular immune response to h1n1 influenza29 obesity is associated with several chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus obstructive sleep apnoea and surfactant dysfunction in the lungs which may increase the risk of complications of sars-cov-2 the intensive care management of patients with severe obesity is always very challenging and difficult30 it is likely that obesity is an independent risk factor for severe sars-cov-2 illness and should be further investigatedearly studies have linked the increased mortality rates in sars-cov-2 patients with the presence of diabetes mellitus increased glucose levels have been associated with the development of ards and worsening of sars-cov-2 illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation hyperglycaemia can be a useful predictor to assess patients and triage them effectively to provide early management strategies strict glucose management is required in such patients to reduce mortality central hypothyroidism and central hypocortisolism seem to occur commonly in patients infected with coronavirus these changes are usually transient and occur during the illness or after recovery this crucial information calls for reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic and identifying these changes early with prompt management can prevent further complications prospective randomised clinical trials cohort studies and pathology studies of sars-cov-2 patients are ongoing and may further elucidate the mechanisms of these endocrinopathies translating into better treatment of patients affected by this virusan outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has led to a serious pandemic 1 the disease in some patients progresses into life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome ards as of february 20 2020 a total of 75567 cases with laboratory confirmed covid-19 have been detected in china of whom 2239 have died and 18644 have been cured despite a fatality rate of 296 which is lower than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers rapid disease progression and complicated manifestations continue to present great challenges to effective management thus the identification of risk factors related to disease prognosis is valuable to guide treatment implementation and improve utilization of limited resources a prior study of critically ill patients with covid-19 showed that increased age comorbidities and ards were associated with increased risk of death 2 it has been reported that the majority 809 of 2019-ncov infected patients have mild disease with diverse clinical courses due to the heterogeneity of the affected population 3 however risk factors that affected the clinical course of patients with covid-19 pneumonia have yet to be further studiedcomputed tomography ct has been proven as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of covid-19 45 recent publications have characterized typical ct findings of covid-19 pneumonia during the acute progressive and recovery stages 678 ct findings such as ground glass opacities ggo and consolidation were found to correlate with the duration of infection 7 in this regard an understanding of the characteristics of initial chest ct may help to identify prognostic indicators for covid-19 9 the potential associations of age and laboratory test results ie white blood cells lymphocytes and c-reactive protein with disease progression have been demonstrated in severe patients 10 given the above the purpose of this study was to identify the initial chest ct findings and clinical characteristics that were linked to the clinical course of covid-19 pneumoniafrom january 16 to february 13 2020 a total of 72 patients 39 men 462  159 years with covid-19 confirmed by nucleic acid test were identified from three hospitals in xian shaanxi province china baseline chest ct and laboratory examination results were collected all the patients were treated based on a national standard diagnosis and treatment criteria for covid-19 which includes initiation of antivirals interferon chinese herbal medications supplemental oxygen as needed and hospitalization 11 the disease type ie uncomplicated illness mild pneumonia and severe pneumonia was evaluated by the world health organization criteria in which critical ards sepsis or septic shock were considered severe 12 as covid-19 pneumonia represents a new and rapidly developing outbreak standards were developed to assess patient recovery and readiness for discharge after treatment 11 and were set as follows 1 normal body temperature for more than 3 days 2 significant improvement of respiratory symptoms such as respiratory rate hypoxemia or spo2 values returned to normal range 3 inflammation of the lungs showed obvious findings of absorption on ct imaging and 4 two consecutive negative respiratory viral nucleic acid tests taken at least one day apartthe chest ct scans were acquired by using 16- to 64-multidetector ct scanners philips brilliant 16 philips healthcare best netherlands ge vct lightspeed 64 ge healthcare milwaukee wi usa ge optima 680 ge healthcare waukesha wi usa the ct parameters were as follows 120 kvp current intelligent control auto ma of 30300 ma and slice thickness reconstructions of 0615 mm all ct scans were performed without intravenous contrast materialthe demographic data exposure history clinical symptoms laboratory findings and the time from disease onset to hospital visit were obtained from the medical records the date of disease onset was defined as patients reported date of symptom onset the clinical course ie the time from symptom onset to discharge with recovery or the end of follow-up were collected the ct images were each independently reviewed by two experienced radiologists with 5 years of experience and if there was a disagreement the diagnosis would be made in consensus by another expert with more than 10 years of experience in respiratory imaging as previously reported 8 ct findings including the presence and distribution of ggo consolidation linear opacity pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were evaluated we also evaluated the degree of lobar involvement and total lung severity score each of the five lung lobes was assessed in detail for degree or area of involvement and assigned a score of 0 for 0 lobe involvement 1 for 125 lobe involvement 2 for 2650 lobe involvement 3 for 5175 lobe involvement or 4 for 76100 lobe involvement according to visual evaluation 8 a total severity score was calculated by summing the five lobe scores range 020the initial chest ct findings and clinical characteristics were compared among the disease severity groups uncomplicated mild and severe continuous variables were represented as means and standard deviations or median and range while categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages chi-square test was used for categorical variables t test was used for continuous variables and nonparametric rank test was used for non-conforming variables the clinical outcome event of interest in this study was patient recovery and hospital discharge data were censored in events such as death or discharge without recovery univariate cox proportional hazard regression analysis was first used to explore the association of ct findings age sex and laboratory-testing with the length of hospitalization until the occurrence of the outcome event or the end of follow-up for those who had not been discharged during the study period then variables with p values  02 in univariate analysis were used to further analyze the associations with the clinical course by multivariable cox proportional hazard regression analysis variables such as total lung severity score duration between the symptom onset and presentationct examination time and number of lung lobes affected were collapsed into binary data by grouping them by the median of each data for cox regression analysis because the outcome event for the analysis was defined as recovery and hospital discharge hazard ratio hr values  1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at 4 weeks and longer time until discharge compared with the reference category in addition the univariable unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted kaplan-meier curves were used for displaying the cumulative incidence of discharge with recovery for the identified factors all statistical analyses were performed using spss 200 ibm corp armonk ny usa and medcalc 190 medcalc software ltd ostend belgium software p  005 was considered statistically significantthree patients had uncomplicated illness 61 patients had mild disease and 8 patients had severe disease fourteen patients initially had negative nucleic acid tests that were subsequently positive patients had been admitted to the hospital for 4 to 27 days median 17 days thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period and the median length of the clinical course was 155 days range 9 to 25 days for those who remained hospitalized at the end of this investigation the median length of hospitalization was 175 days range 4 to 27 days no patient died during the study period among those with covid-19 the severe patients were older than patients with mild and uncomplicated illness p  0001 laboratory testing at initial hospital-visit indicated that 306 of patients had low lymphocyte counts table 1the median interval time between the initial ct and the symptom onset was 3 days range 112 days among all patients 222 had ggo 236 had ggo and consolidation 83 exhibited consolidation 42 had ggo and linear opacities 56 had consolidation and linear opacities and 319 had all three signs 611 of patients had involvement of three or more lobes and 750 of patients had bilateral abnormalities in addition three patients had a negative initial ct but positive nucleic acid tests with fever or sore throat as the only clinical manifestation the ct findings are detailed in table 2 figure 1 shows the serial ct images of three patients with 41 47 and 66 years of age respectively on follow-up ct the 66-year-old patient had a higher total severity score than that of the two younger patients  5 score vs 1 score and did not meet the guideline criteria to be dischargedunivariable cox regression analysis indicated that seven variables ie age onset time lesion characteristics number of lung lobes affected bilateral involvement lung severity score and lymphocyte count correlated with the length of hospitalization with a p value  020 table 3 multivariable cox regression further found that the lung severity score and lymphocyte count were independently correlated with the event of discharge with recovery table 3 the adjusted hr value of the lung severity score  4 vs  4 as the reference category and lymphocyte count reduced vs normal or elevated as the reference category were 041 95 confidence interval ci 018092 p  0031 and 014 95 ci 003060 p  0008 respectively in addition the unadjusted kaplan-meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidences of discharge with recovery in the groups with lung severity score  4 and in the group with lung severity score  4 on day 24 were 733 and 418 respectively fig 2a the cumulative incidence of discharge with recovery on day 25 in the group with normal or elevated lymphocyte count and in the group with reduced lymphocyte was 874 and 163 respectively fig 2bin this paper we used the baseline ct and clinical features to explore which factors related to the clinical course in patients with covid-19 pneumonia results indicated that older patients may have more severe disease higher lung severity score and lower lymphocyte count were found to be independently associated with a significantly lower rate of discharge these findings support the role of ct imaging and clinical indices at initial hospital-visit for potentially predicting the hospitalization time of patients with covid-19 pneumoniaduring the observation time there were 8 patients with severe disease who were older than patients with mild and uncomplicated illness this result was consistent with previous data 8 similar to the sars-cov and the mers-cov the 2019-ncov appears to cause more severe disease in older patients 1314 therefore elderly patients should be closely monitored meanwhile it has been observed that the main manifestations of initial ct in covid-19 patients were ggo ggo with consolidation and bilateral lung involvement consistent with prior studies 681516 these findings likely correlate pathologically with edema inflammatory infiltrates pneumocyte hyperplasia and organization during an exudative and proliferative acute-phase of covid-19 pneumonia 17 among the ct findings lung injury severity score was found to correlate with the length of clinical course results indicated that the cumulative incidence of recovery and hospital discharge in group with lung severity scores  4 733 was significantly higher than in those with scores  4 612 within the four weeks one study regarding covid-19 related acute respiratory disease suggested that interstitial abnormalities seen on ct on admission were significantly correlated with the patients endpoints such as discharge intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation 10 our study also shows that initial ct findings correlate with the clinical course in patients with covid-19 pneumoniain addition to the imaging findings laboratory findings are also important factors to consider 10 this study found that lymphocyte counts correlate with the clinical course of covid-19 the cumulative incidence of recovery and hospital discharge in patients with normal or elevated lymphocyte count was 874 within four weeks which was significantly higher than that in patients with decreased lymphocyte count 163 these results were consistent with previous reports 1018 as lymphopenia is an essential characteristic of impaired immunity 19 huang et al 20 found lymphopenia in 63 patients and a cytokine storm profile in those who were critically ill the combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response may have an impact on the severity of illness similar to what has been proven in sars and mers 20 therefore this study suggests that regular observation of lymphocyte counts in patients with covid-19 is beneficial for the detection of disease progression and guiding clinical decision-making and adjustment of treatmentit is worth noting that among the patients who were discharged 3 had a negative ct but positive nucleic acid tests at presentation and all had uncomplicated illness these patients initially had fever or sore throat as the only clinical manifestation interestingly all patients had positive findings on their second ct all three patients were recovered and discharged at the end of follow-up it is speculated that for these patients the virus primarily affected the upper respiratory tract instead of the lower respiratory tract and with treatment their symptoms improved quickly therefore ct scan may correlate with the clinical course by identifying the different patterns and characteristics of the infectionthis paper has some limitations firstly the sample size of the study is small and larger samples are needed to further clarify the findings second we did not analyze the occurrence of adverse events such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the current study because there was such a small number of adverse events it was not possible to analyze them thus a follow-up study with more patients may allow for analysis of such events third further follow-up is required to evaluate the outcomes of patients with continued hospitalization status fourth the clinical course may be affected by multiple other factors than the disease course or prognosis itself such as administrative and logistical factors given the fact that covid-19 is spreading worldwide the treatment status for patients in epidemic foci may be affected by the administrative and logistical factors due to the large number of patients however in non-epidemic areas the number of patients are far less than that of patients in epidemic areas the government and hospitals have reliable administrative and logistical support therefore in non-focus areas the results may have fewer confounding variables and be a better reference for researchin conclusion lung severity score  4 and reduced lymphocyte count at initial evaluation were independently associated with a substantially lower rate of recovery and hospital discharge at four weeks and more extended hospitalization in patients admitted for covid-19 pneumoniathe pathogen responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this novel coronavirus was first detected in wuhan china in late december 2019 1 since initial detection of the virus more than 1800000 cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide and over 400000 persons have recovered the first case in israel was reported on february 27 2020 to date over 13500 have been diagnosed and more than 4000 have recovered 2initially during the outbreak of covid-19 in israel all persons who tested positive were admitted to hospitals nowadays all those with mild disease are isolated in designated hotels whereas those with moderate and severe disease are admitted to designated internal medicine or intensive care unit departments within hospitals the criterion for discharge from isolation is two consecutive negative tests of sars-cov-2 rna detection one difficulty faced by clinicians as well as by patients is the unknown time-frame of hospitalization until discharge of symptomatic patientsthe aims of our report are to offer a time-frame for ending the isolation of patients affected by covid-19 and to describe the time to recovery according to demographic characteristics sex differences and coexisting conditions we describe the dynamics of the disease that paralleled changes in the viral load based on sars-cov-2 rna detection during february and march 2020we followed the 20 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection who were treated following a diagnosis of covid-19 and who recovered from the infection during march 2020 all the diagnoses were by semi-quantitative rt-pcr on nasopharyngeal swabswe assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from nasopharyngeal samples that were obtained once daily for the first 3 days following hospital admission and once every 2 or 3 days until discharge clinical specimens for covid-19 diagnostic testing were obtained in accordance with us centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines nasopharyngeal samples were tested with the assay developed by the cdc 3 and based on the world health organization standard all the samples were refrigerated and shipped to rabin medical center where rna extraction rt-pcr and the virus isolation and titration procedures were performed envelope protein gene e rna-dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp and nucleocapsid n gene were measured by the rt-pcr allplextm 2019-ncov 45 if one target was detected the assay was reported as positive recovery was defined as two negative measurements for all three genes here we describe the days to recovery from the first day of appearance of symptoms local ethical board approval and informed consent for analyzing routine procedures during the outbreak was waved at the time by the director-general of the israel ministry of healthdescriptive statistics were used to summarize the data the results are reported as means and standard deviations or ranges categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages we used chi square and fishers exact test to study differences between men and women between persons older and younger than the median age and between those with and without elevated body temperature 38 during hospitalization we calculated a morbidity score for each patient according to the number of chronic diseases at the time of admission according to this score we examined the association between morbidity and time to recovery the kruskal-wallis test was used to compare those with and without comorbidities upon admission no imputation was made for missing data all the analyses were performed with ibm spss statisticsthe population consisted of 8 women and 12 men the mean age was 490 171 years range 18-75 years yet women were older 602 vs 414 p0012 thirteen 65 had a body temperature above 38c at admission 6 30 had hypertension 3 15 type 2 diabetes 9 45 dyslipidemia and three were current smokers only one patient was treated by chloroquine zinc and azithromycin during hospitalization the mean time to discharge was 17 days the range was 13-21 days the mean length of hospital stay was longer for patients who presented with a body temperature above 38c during hospitalization n13 than for those who did not have an elevated body temperature 175 vs 167 days p06 accordingly the number of days to negative detection of each gene was longer among those with an elevated body temperature than among those without gene e 155 vs 153 gene n 175 vs 167 and gene rdrp 158 vs 156 p005 for all stratifying our population by median age above and below 44 years the time to full recovery was shorter for the younger than the older patients 170 vs 173 days the time to negative detection of each gene was also shorter among the younger than the older patients for example 144 vs 167 days p008 for gene e elevated body temperature presented in 78 79 of the older patients and 54 611 of the younger patients
figure 1
a describes the time in days until a complete negative result negative detection of all three genes according to patient sex although older the women exhibited a shorter time to recovery than did the men 167 vs 175 days p06 we further examined the time from admission until negative detection of each gene figure 1b shows the time to recovery in all three detected genes by hospitalization day from the first day of symptoms all genes e rdrp and n correlated with the sum of days leading to discharge the strongest correlation was for gene n r078 r082 r10 respectively p0001 for all the time to recovery was longer for patients with hypertension or lung disease compared to those without hypertension for those with hypertension n6 the number of days to recovery was 185 vs 166 p013 and for each of the genes e rdrp and n 178 vs 144 p003 177 vs 149 p005 and 185 vs 166 p013 respectively in patients with no chronic illnesses at the time of admission n11 negative detections of gene e and rdrp were after 145 and 149 days respectively this contrasts to 164 and 167 days respectively for those with comorbidities upon admission full recovery was determined in those without comorbidities after 170 days when gene n was also not detected and for those with comorbidities after 174 daysthe time to discharge after the onset of covid-19 symptoms is two weeks minimum recovery was longer for patients with comorbidities especially hypertension or those with elevated body temperature during hospitalization women seem to recover faster than mensome studies have reported sex-differences in patients with covid-19 6 suggesting that men might be affected at a higher rate and more severely than women in italy 82 of 1591 patients were men 7 moreover among critically ill patients in china 67 were men 8 although the reasons for a possibly lower rate of infection among women are not fully understood we suggest that women once affected might recover more quicklyin our cohort patients with comorbidities and specifically those with hypertension were more likely to present a longer recovery whether patients with hypertension are at increased risk for covid-19 infection has been recently debated 9 among 1043 patients in italy 49 had hypertension 7of the three genes measured by the rt-pcr gene n was most correlated with full recovery from covid-19 in a recent study of 9 patients 10 seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50 of the patients and in 14 days in all of them but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load this emphasizes the need for a method that correlates between serological and rt-pcr teststo our knowledge this is the first report to offer a time-frame for recovery from covid-19 and the end of isolation depending on baseline and hospitalization conditions of the patientsall authors have no conflict of interestthe coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the global economy and on behavioral practices of people worldwide until its early detection in wuhan china in 2019 the virus was unknown to the scientific world and the extent of its damage was unmeasurable however upon its outbreak various research including but not limited to victor 1 and batista 2 began to predict the scale that the virus would hit the world the ratio of the death to recovery rate has seemingly been a positive proportion with the slow but deliberate efforts by governments of developed and developing countries to control slow and possibly halt the further spread of the virus contact tracing and testing has reached millions of people with the sensitivity of the testing approach the polymerase chain reaction pcr the infected and exposed populations were easily identified for isolation and quarantine respectively in a bid to slow the curve of secondary infections and manage the critically affected infected group meanwhile a common trend that seems to show a ray of hope in the fight against the coronavirus was the unattended recovery of infected and exposed patients and despite the absence of a food and drug administration-approved vaccine this recovery rate seems to be encouraging however as the recovery rate and infection rate continues to increase the question that has eluded health care workers the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization who is if there will be reinfection after a patient with covid-19 has recovered clinicallyin the literature victor 1 nesteruk 3 and ming et al 4 focus has been placed on the outbreak exposure and the rate of infection for covid-19 by the use of various models to study the trend of the pandemic in their studies nesteruk 3 and ming et al 4 used the popular susceptible-infectious-removed sir model to obtain optimal values for the model parameters for use with a statistical approach and hence predicted the number of infected susceptible and removed persons over time this model approach by nesteruk 3 has been a major breakthrough in modelling disease control and has been used by several authors eg ming et al 4 and victor 1 however although there exists a worldwide interest in contact tracing testing isolating those that are exposed to covid-19 and estimating and projecting the rate of worldwide infections what is more interesting is an estimation that could evaluate the probability of reinfection by those who have recovered from covid-19 therefore in this study the approach developed by victor 1 based on an age-structured model developed and used by victor and oduwole 5 for hivaids transmission in africa was adopted which is a deterministic endemic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed-undetectable-susceptible seirus modelthe seirus model was used due to the resulting solutions that captured the relevant parameters for the exposed and untransmitable classes which are not present in the sir model as used by nesteruk 3 and batista 2the resulting equations from the seirus model are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations used to capture the susceptible rate rate of exposure infectious rate and the rate of recovery in addition the equations capture the rate of reinfection which is captured in the undetectable class that is clinically ascertained by the pcr testing approach for the recovered populationnumerical experiments with relevant simulation showing how the variation of the reproductive number r0 affects the number of infected individuals were carried out as well as a projection for the rate of reinfection by the recovered class conscious effort to evaluate the new deterministic seirus model was done to reduce the r0 to zero and possibly halt the spread of the disease thereby leading to an endemic equilibrium and eradication of the disease in the futurethe worldwide covid-19 pandemic and the lack or inefficiency of purposeful and result-based interventions are great calls for other empirical and scientific interventions that seek to review strategic models and recommendations of social and scientific research for disease control although previous studies have been tailored toward the epidemiology and the disease-free equilibrium dfe where the r0 of the infectious population is at its bare minimum this study seeks to evaluate the impact of a new endemic deterministic model on the endemic equilibrium while taking into consideration the possibility of the recovered population being undetectable and fit to be moved to the susceptible class which will therefore imply zero secondary infection of the disease worldwidein summary this study aims to use the new deterministic endemic seirus compartmental model for covid-19 dynamics which combines quarantine and observation procedures and behavioral change and social distancing in the control and eradication of the disease in the most exposed subpopulations to predict the chances of reinfection by the recovered classas suggested in victor 1 and victor and oduwole 5 the variables and parameters for the investigation of the stability analysis of the equilibrium state for the new deterministic endemic model are given in tables 1 and 2the following assumptions as suggested in victor 1 and victor and oduwole 5 help in the derivation of the modelthis study uses the deterministic endemic model where a susceptible class is a class that is yet to be infected but is open to infection as interactions with members of the i class continue an infected individual is one who has contracted the coronavirus and is at some stage of infection a removed individual is one that is confirmed to have the virus with its expected symptoms and is under quarantine while following relevant observation procedures a member of the undetectable class is one that has been removed does not secrete the virus anymore and has satisfied the who standard to be in the undetectable classthe following diagram 1 describes the dynamic of the seirus framework and will be useful in the formulation of model equations

the following equations are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations for projecting the detection rate of the presence of the virus in the clinically prescribed recovered population based on the assumptions and the flow diagram previously mentioned

the incidence rate or force of infection at time t denoted by bt in the populationis given by

the model equations in proportion according to victor 1 was adopted for this study as follows

however s  e  i  r  u  1equations 10-14 are the model equations in proportions which define the prevalence of infectionthe dfe state of the endemic seirus model is obtained by setting the left-hand sides of equations 10-14 to zero while setting the disease components e  i  r  u  0 leading to equations 15 and 16

0s
16after substituting equation 16 into 15 we have  which makes 0we then take 15 where s0 or0    s  s2
17simplifying this further gives usas2  bs  c  0 18in equation 18 a1 b and c

therefore the solution for the equations in 18 are given by

ignoring the native values of  and other stringent conditions there exists a unique trivial and dfe state at  given by 00 the solution of equation 19 satisfies equation 18 identicallyin the event that patients recover from covid-19 it is assumed that they are disease free for at least 14 days after their last clinical test shows that they have clinically recovered from the virus hence to study the behavior of the equations 10-14 around the dfe state e000000 we resort to the linearized stability approach from victor 1 which gives us a jacobian  transformation of the form

hence according to gerald 6 the determinant of the jacobian matrix  is given by the recursive definition of a 5 x 5 matrix defined as

from equation 20det0 22similarly from the trace of the jacobian matrix  given in equation 20 we have

hence since def0 and trace0 which does satisfy the prescribed threshold criteria based on gerald 6 then the dfe e0 for covid-19 does satisfy the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability for the recovered population this implies that the pandemic of covid-19 as declared by who 7 does not have a curative vaccine so far and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observation procedures therefore for the recovered population the chances of reinfection appear to be uncertain though nearly impossible unless regular clinical tests are not accurately administeredthe basic r0 is defined as the number of secondary infections that one infectious individual would create over the duration of the infectious period provided that everyone else is susceptible r01 is a threshold and if the number is below it the generation of secondary cases is insucient to maintain the infection in human communities if r01 the number of infected individuals will decrease from one generation to the next and the disease dies out if r01 the number of infected individuals will increase from one generation to the next and the disease will persistto compute the basic reproductive number r0 of the model with the incidence rate for the recovered population assumed to vanish such that b0 we employed the next generation method as applied by deikmann et al 8 and van den driessche and watmough 9

fi and vi are the rate of appearances of new infections in compartment i and the transfer of individuals into and out of compartment i by all means respectively using the linearization method the associated matrices at dfe e0 and after taking partial derivatives as defined by

we find the eigenvalues of fv1 by setting the determinant fv1  i  0

the characteristics polynomial is2the characteristics equation is given as20we solve the characteristics equation for the eigenvalues 12 where r0 is the maximum of the two eigenvalues 12 hence the basic r0 is the dominant eigenvalues of fv1 thus we have thatr00 26the basic reproductive number r00 of equation 26 shows that with no incidence rate in the recovered population there is no chance of a secondary infection by patients with covid-19 who have been clinically declared negative and free from the virus ie the virus is completely cleared from their system hence although there currently exists no clinical vaccine for the cure of covid-19 with equation 26 there is a high chance of zero cases of reinfection after clinical recovery from the virus according to the who 10 the total cases of covid-19 worldwide stands at about 900000 with a total of about 190000 recovered and the current total deaths is about 44000 from about 172 countries figures 1 and 2 show the cumulative case count per country 11 and worldwide 11 respectivelythe age-structured deterministic model in equations 10-14 was solved numerically using the runge-kutta-fehllberg fourth to fifth order method and implemented using maple software maplesoft the model equations were first transformed into proportions thus reducing the model equations to 10 differential equations the parameters used in the implementation of the model are shown in table 3 parameters were chosen in consonance with the threshold values obtained in the stability analysis of the dfe state of the modelhence from equation 26 the reproductive number r00 means there is a 100 chance of zero secondary reinfections from the recovered compartment of the covid-19 patient group when a reinfected population interacts by contact with the susceptible population figure 3 shows the rate of recovery and rate of infection for covid-19 and figure 4 shows the rate of reinfectionthe analysis clearly shows that the secondary infection rate satisfies the local and worldwide stability criteria and the dfe for an endemic situation unlike the respiratory syncytial virus which causes a significant respiratory disease often in those 5 years or younger covid-19 is estimated to burden more than 10000 people worldwide although the stability analysis shows that there is no chances of secondary reinfection by the recovered class the rate of the infectious will continue to rise asymptotically over a long period of time and there after begin to slide in a normal trajectory if no vaccine is available batista 2 and nesteruk 3 focused their study on the impact of the infectious class in the subpopulation with the sir model and forecasted a rapid geometric growth in the spread of the virus worldwide and a subsequent progression in the rate of recovery among the exposed and infectious groupsaccording to victor 1 the model equations that exhibit the dfe e0 state for covid-19 satisfies the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability when the basic r00 for an endemic situation this implies that the covid-19 pandemic as declared by who 7 does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observation procedureshowever with the various make shift treatments social distancing measures and quarantine strategies being adopted the recovery rate will keep rising slowly but steadily over a long period of time therefore as the recovery rate continues to grow steadily the number of recovered patients who have been clinically declared free of the virus by the pcr test are also declared uninfectious as long as the virus is completely cleared from their system and the rate of detection will vanish making the rate of secondary infection r00 as long as the incidence rate b0there is a need for a dedicated effort from individual populations governments health organizations policy makers and stakeholders the world is hardly rid of covid-19 and further spread is eminent the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery until a curative vaccine is developedwith the worldwide health sector in a bid to tackle covid-19 this study gives encouragement to the policy makers and public health care sectors as there is zero secondary reinfections by the recovered population therefore the policy makers and public health sectors can enhance contact tracking tracing and testing to improve the isolation and quarantine of the infected and exposed classes in addition the health sector could use covid-19 antibodies from the samples of the recovered class to develop effective vaccines for the virus however since the hypothesis of zero reinfections has not been clinically proven further observations should be carried out on the recovered class in clusters to study the progression of the exposed with the re-exposed subpopulations to see by clinical examination the possibilities of reinfection and thereby promote the use of these antibodies for vaccine creationthis study was limited by the variability of data available at the time of developing this paper meanwhile from the statistics the infected cases and fatalities were projected to increase geometrically therefore the findings of this study are based on sample data taken at the time of the studyin addition with the seirus model and the discovery that the r00 we concluded that there are no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes however reports from worldwide public health data have shown that there has been a few rare cases of reinfection of some from the recovered class and they are suspected to be reinfected by a rare type of the coronavirus but not covid-19a novel coronavirus named covid-19 was identified in december 2019 in wuhan china which caused infectious pneumonia and spread rapidly however there has been no consensus on the nomenclature of novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp from the perspective of traditional chines medicine tcm so far academician tong xiaolin suggested that the disease should be named as cold-dampness pestilence  1 and academician wang qi called the disease pulmonary pestilence  in the manual for traditional chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment of ncp 2 in general there is an agreement on the opinion that ncp belongs to the category of epidemic disease  in tcm as the special climate of wuhan where the local temperature in last winter was higher than that in previous winter and the rainfall was more frequent than snowfall the syndromes of ncp patients often presented the characteristics of dampness pathogen  in tcm integrating the analysis resulted from professor liu qingquan and dr xiang qiong 3 4 we consider that ncp covid-19 should be defined as dampness toxin pestilence  dampness toxin  runs through the comprehensive pathology of ncp even in gansu a region with dry climate the researchers found that the characteristics of dampness pathogen from ncp patients were similar to those in wuhan 5chinese medicine cm has accumulated abundant clinical experiences and effective formulas on the prevention and treatment of epidemic diseases in ming dynasty wu youke a famous chinese medicine doctor believed that the pathogen of epidemic disease was different from the six excesses  but was a kind of pestilent qi  that had high contagious and powerful toxic features pestilent qi is prone to encroaching specific organs and involving multiple organs failure and commonly breaks out in populated large cities in 2004 a clinical study including 524 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars showed that the duration of major symptoms in the group of patients treated by integrated chinese and western medicines was significantly shorter than those in the group treated by western medicine alone 6 the satisfied therapeutic effects of tcm in preventing and treating sars suggested the superiority of tcm on severe infectious diseasesin march 2020 the diagnosis and treatment guideline of novel coronavirus pneumonia edition 7 was released by the national health commission nhc of peoples republic of china 7 in which qingfei paidu decoction qfpdd and other tcm formulas were recommended to treat ncp although it is necessary to consider the real pathological evolutions of patients based on local climatic features and individual physical characteristics of patients the inconsistency of syndrome types  is prone to producing cluttered chinese medicine formulas in the view of this the tcm symptom types in this study complied with those in the guideline from treatment to recovery periodtherefore this study aimed to figure out efficacy of tcm in treating ncp to explore the relationship of the tcms influence factors with patients individual characteristics and to optimize qfpdd and nhc-recommended formulas corresponding to the treatment and recovery period of ncpby using both statistics analysis and network pharmacological technology this study can not only partially reveal the therapeutic mechanisms of tcm through the corresponding relationships among formula medicine and syndrome but also provide scientific evidence for screening and optimizing tcm formulas for the treatment of ncpdata of 54 patients with ncp namely sars-cov-2 pneumonia covid-19 undergoing cms treatment originated from the department of infectious disease in jihe hospital from wuhan during january 24 to february 17 the information about patients age gender symptoms temperature use of tcms and results of laboratory examinations during hospitalization were collected through hospital information system histhe clinical characteristics of patients and frequency of cms use were described independent t test was used to measure the differences of clinical characteristics among patients in varied demographic groups and paired t test was used to measure the differences of patients blood test results between admission and discharge of hospital which could indicate the effect of cms correlation analysis was applied to investigate the relevance among various symptoms and tcm clinical features multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital staythe compound information of all the 21 chinese medicines in qfpdd were collected there were one to three herbs selected as the sovereign medicinal  to represent the main effect of the recommended formulas of five disease stages mild moderate severe critical and recovery stagesfor target prediction and active compound ctarget t network construction we input the smiles of the compounds into online tools similarity ensemble approach sea to predict the putative targets the software cytoscape version 370 was used to construct active compounds-targets network and the network parameters of each element were analysed based on the plug-in network analyzer for further analysisa web-based gene set analysis toolkit was applied for the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway enrichment analysis of putative targets parameter settings were as follows homo sapiens in organism of interest over-representation analysis ora in method of interest and kegg in functional databasetcm comprehension on pathological evolution of ncp and medication paradigm were analyzed based on syndrome differentiation as ncp belongs to the category of epidemic disease the pathogen is generally attributed to dampness toxin according to the main symptom characteristics of this disease tcm believes that ncp locates in lung and is closely related to spleen and stomach and its pathological changes involve in heart liver and kidney in the later stages dampness pathogen can change into cold-dampness  pathogen following the yin body constitution  and also become the dampness-heat  pathogen following the yang body constitution  clinical observation shows that dampness toxin can directly invade into middle energizer  in partly ncp patients and leads to the dysfunction of qi movement if the treatment method is appropriate and sufficient healthy qi  gradually recovers the pathogen will be driven out consequently the patient will enter into the recovery period at the same time clinical manifestations appear some symptoms of qi and yin deficiency  thus the pathological evolution of ncp in tcm can be summarized as dampness toxin invading defense exterior  in early stage and then enters the lungs and influences spleen function eventually involves heart liver and kidney which causes yang qi collapse  by excess pathogen and yin and yang separates from each other  if the treatment is timely and suitable sufficient healthy qi can eliminate the pathogen syndromes with deficiency of qi and yin in lung and spleen will be manifested fig 1although the pathogen between ncp and sars have certain similarities in virus origination the tcm pathogenesis of ncp and sars appear to be different table 1except using cms treatment according to tcm different syndromes the application of achievements from modern pharmacological research on cms targeting the pathological changes of ncp at different periods will also improve therapeutic effects for example ephedra sinica stapf schizonepeta tenuifolia briq perillae folium and lonicerae japonicae flos have antipyretic and analgesic actions and ma xing shi gan decoction  arctium lappa l and poria cocos schw wolf are able to regulate immune function and suppress inflammatory cytokine storm suggesting that tcm plays a comprehensive beneficial regulating role in the treatment of ncp through multi-level and multi-pathwaysdemographic characteristics of

patientsthe five disease stages consist of nine syndromes and nine formulas the sovereign medicinal of mild disease stage contained pogostemon cablin blanco atractylodes lancea thunbdc scutellariae radix chaihu radix bupleuri forsythiae fructus the moderate stage contained gypsum atractylodes lancea thunbdc polygoni cuspidati rhizoma et radix pogostemon cablin blanco verbenae herb the severe

contained hedysarum multijugum maxim ophiopogon japonicus linn f ker-gawl panacis quinquefolii radixthere are 21 cms in the qfpdd and 16 cms in recommended formulas of five disease stages after deleting duplication 32 different cms were selected in total as the ophiopogon japonicus linn f ker-gawl gypsum and buffalo horn were not found in tcmsp database finally 29 cms were picked in this study there are 201 compounds in recommended formulas of five disease stages and 288 compounds in the qfpdd after screening comparing with the compound in sovereign medicinal we discovered kaempferol beta-sitosterol stigmasterol quercetin luteolin genkwanin diop isorhamnetin participated in three or more disease stages at the same time these compounds were not unique to a single chinese herbal medicine but many common cms comparing the compounds in qfpdd with those in recommended formulas of the first four disease stages seven of the eight compounds except isorhamnetin were found to be representative in qfpdd and in recommended formulas of three or four disease stagesthe recommended formulas included 164 types of putative targets in mild disease stage 147 types in moderate stage 150 types in severe stage 88 types in critical stage and 112 types in recovery stage totally there were 204 types of different targets in recommended formulas and 240 targets in qfpdd after comparing the putative targets of five disease stage it was found that 169 of the 204 targets were common targets among which 58 were involved in the treatment of all five disease stages by comparing qfpdd with recommended formulas of the first four stages it was found that only 9 of 248 targets have nothing to do with qfpdd and 60 targets were common targetsaccording to the compounds c-putative targets t network c-t network related to the five stages the degree value of quercetin luteolin kaempferol acacetin and genkwanin were all greater than 30 and exist in a variety of cms which acted on different disease stages fig 2 and the degree value of a total of 25 targets was greater than 30 among which the first five were cyp1b1 esr1 esr2 ar and abcg2 respectivelythen a c-t network of qrpdd was constructed similarly by considering the large number of targets only 60 common targets in qfpdd and recommended formulas of the first four disease stages were selected for visualization fig 3 for the compounds kaempferol quercetin luteolin galangin luteolin isorhamnetin and the degree value were all greater than 30 for the targets the first five were cyp1b1 abcg2 ca7 ca4 and esr2 respectivelythe

to the enrichment results of pathways corresponding to the five disease stages figure b c and d show a large number of enrichment pathways while e and f are more concentrated nitrogen metabolism is presented in the first four diseases stages with a high enrichment rate as well as a low p value and the expression of arachidonic acid metabolism in the critical disease stages was the most obvious indicating that formulas were more inclined to inhibit pathogens in the critical diseases stage ovarian steroidogenesis exists mainly in severe and critical disease stages for qfpdd nitrogen metabolism linoic acid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis have high enrichment rate figure a which is roughly consistent with the results of mild and moderate stagesfigure a represents qfpdd and figure b-f represent recommended formulas of mild moderate severe critical and recovery stages of the disease respectively the x axis means enrichment ratio and the y axis means the name of kegg pathwaysgenerally the clinical results of our study showed that 54 ncp patients enhanced immune ability against covid-19 by detecting blood samples after tcm treatment and category of isrd appears to shorten patients hospitalization daysfirstly the hemogram changes of patients in this study can reflect the efficacy of tcm treatment on ncp in a certain extent as a common symptom among ncp patients the lymphocytopenia was observed in this study though it was not severe according to recent studies on clinical characteristics of ncp lymphocytopenia was one of the most common laboratory abnormalities observed in ncp patients and occurred in 703832 of patients 8 9 the abnormalities like lymphocytopenia suggested that covid-19 infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency 9 thus the increase of lymphocyte during the tcm treatment in this study could be regarded as a result of tcm improving patients hemogram by adjusting immune system 10in this study the average hospitalization time of 54 ncp patients in moderate type was 896 days under the treatment of tcm and the length of hospital stay was related to the tcm in category of isrd suggesting that chinese medicines could effectively shorten the pathological evolution of ncp as the pathogenesis of ncp in chinese medicine theory belongs to dampness and toxin and dampness pathogen mainly influence the digestive function of spleen stomach and intestine the primary therapeutic strategy focuses on improving digestive function for dispelling dampness pathogenadditionally our study also found that abnormal digestion was associated with the clinical symptoms of fever and cough by correlation analysis which powerfully illustrated the relationship of the pathogenesis of ncp with the dysfunction of digestive system eg spleen stomach and intestine therefore our study demonstrates that chinese medicines with an effect of isrd should be beneficial to attenuate the pathological evolution of ncpinterestingly the category of removing toxin did not account for the predominant relation with the length of hospital stay from the result of multiple linear regression analysis showing the therapeutic methods were primarily attributed to isrd rather than removing toxin the results indicated the function of chinese medicines on ncp treatment focus on strengthening sufficient healthy qi enhancing body immune ability instead of dispelling pathogen targeting against covid-19 one of supported evidences was that the number of leukocytes neutrophil lymphocyte and platelet significantly increased at the end of integrated treatmentduring rescuing critical ncp patients in wuhan academician li lanjuans team mentioned that it was important to maintain patients intestinal microenvironment balance and tcm had advantages on reducing intestinal bacterial migration to lung and secondary infection this view has been included into the diagnosis and treatment guideline of ncp edition 7 7 as the development of intestine and lung originate from the same source in embryonic stage studies indicate that bacterial and viral infections in lung can affect intestinal microenvironment through the gut-lung axis and vice versa in animal model of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome the intestinal specific bacteria such as bacteroides spp can directly transfer to lung through damaged intestinal barrier revealing that these two critical and high mortality diseases have a common pathogenesis mechanism 11 sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome are also the pathological results of severe and critical ncp patients suffering from cytokine storm which are the main death cause for patient 12 13 previous studies have confirmed that intestinal microenvironmental disorders and imbalance of intestinal flora can cause the occurrence and development of respiratory diseases through the gut-lung axis therefore lung diseases can be treated by adjusting intestinal microbiota 14 15in the theoretical system of tcm there is a doctrine of lung and large intestine in pair  some scholars have suggested that tcm pathogenesis of ncp is related to the lung-spleen-large intestine dysfunction 10 16 17 it has been discovered that houttuynia cordata polysaccharide hcp a chinese herbal medicine extract from houttuynia cordata thunb can keep the intestinal homeostasis in h1n1 virus-infected mice and protect the intestinal wall barrier inhibit il-1 production mediated by toll receptors and improve the expression of il-10 suggesting that the effect of anti-inflammatory damage is related to regulation of intestinal microbiota as a main active ingredient of scutellaria baicalensis georgi and coptis chinensis franch berberines bioavailability and in vivo metabolism are found to have close relationship with intestinal organic acids and microbiota 18 19 the doctrine of lung and large intestine in pair in tcm theory is similar to the gut-lung axis in the theory of modern medicine the most frequently used cms for ncp patients in our study also suggests channel tropism  of numerous cms belongs to lung spleen stomach and intestine therefore cms can achieve the purpose of relieving and curing lung diseases by adjusting the intestinal microenvironment balance moreover it is not only one of the mechanisms of chinese medicine treatment for ncp but also one important approach to screen novel chinese medicines for treating ncp in the futurethe network pharmacology results in this study indicated that the recommended formulas in five disease stages have both generality and individuality in the compound level in which compound quercetin luteolin kaempferol acacetin etc all are involved in the treatment of multi-stages of the disease the target and kegg pathway enrichment results also show the certain integrity and the different tendency of formulas meanwhile by comparing the qfpdd with the recommended formula of the first four stages 20 21 we discover that the qfpdd has a certain integrity on the compound level however on the target level the qfpdd has covered most of the predicted target of the recommended formula of the first four disease stages and the mutual target from both two sources have a higher network parameter the kegg pathways enrichment results about qfpdd are consist with the effects of recommended formulas of mild and moderate stages as well all these results confirmed the consistency of qfpdd with the recommended formulas of the first four disease stages from the perspective of network pharmacologyin summary this study suggests tcm has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution of ncp covid-19 and the symptom positive correlation between fever and abnormal digestion indicates that researchers should pay more attention on intestinal functional recovery and microenvironmental balance in the treatment of ncp additionally the network pharmacology results demonstrate the appropriateness of theatrical formulas for qfpdd and other recommended formulas in guideline for the compounds corresponding to targets can cover various stages of the diseaseas there has been no effective targeted drugs for ncp up to now the early intervention to ncp is important in controlling the spread of covid-19 according to the protocol for prevention and control of covid-19 edition 6 by chinese center for disease control and prevention the use of tcm in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases was encouraged and supported and tcm was applied in the whole process of disease 7 22numerous data have showed that the early intervention of tcm and modern medicine have positive effects on shortening time of hospitalization and ameliorating symptoms reducing the development of mild and moderate case to severe case and the mortality rate improving the cure rate and the rehabilitation of the recovery population of ncp patients 23 a report from hunan province suggested that due to the increasing the use of tcm for ncp the patients average hospitalization day was shortened for 2 days and none of the patients turned to critical stage 15 a study about 34 ncp patients mostly moderate type from wuhan found satisfied efficacy of integrated use of cm and western medicine on protecting heart liver kidney and other organ functions as well as reducing inflammatory response and improving immune function through the observation of patients treated with conventional western medicine cm decoctions traditional chinese patent medicines and cm injections 24 25 in a study on 6 cases of severe and critical ncp the results showed that qufeidu no1 formulae  combined with conventional western medicine treatment as well as integrating xuebijing injection  andor lianhua qingwen capsule  significantly improved pathological evolution of critical patients consequently all of patients recovered 26 27however there were still deficiencies of the clinical research evidence on the integration of traditional chinese and western medicine treatment for ncp mainly embodying small sample size the absence of control group and the diversification of treatment programs therefore constantly expanding the sample size and employing standardized randomized controlled trial rct design will give more convincing scientific evidence to demonstrate the superiority of tcm for ncp treatmentat present ncp has been nearly controlled in china by the end of april 1st 2020 up to 9244 of ncp patients have recovered in china on march 23 the state council information office of china reported that 74187 confirmed covid-19 patients 915 of total confirmed cases accepted the combined treatment with tcm and modern medicine and the clinical efficacy observations showed that the total effective rate reached more than 90 28as tong xiaolin said practice proved the importance of sticking to both tcm and modern approaches and chinese medicine had the unique advantage in establishing a collaboration mechanism between them 29 in summary tcm had a definite effect on mild and moderate ncp mainly manifested in relieving symptoms and shortening the time of virus nucleic acid turning negative fig 5 moreover tcm not only played a role in controlling the progression of disease in the early stage but also comforted patients psychologically 30 in addition tcm reduced the proportion of mild to severe cases which could contribute to save medical resources from the perspective of public healththe utilization of tcm has implications for the development of medicines in the future as the ncp virus has some mutations when compared to sars or mers coronavirus the natural compounds effectiveness against the two previous coronaviruses might not be present in the new virus which urges updated tcm formulas in this study the anti-ncp effects of the natural compounds have been mainly confirmed by the screening method and the treatment effect of dampness pathogen results in the shortening of hospital stay for patients of mild type thus tcm treatment was not only effective for the ncp patients but also advantageous to the clinical development of medicines to dampness pathogen and lung infection diseases which have high incidence rate of respiratory system syndrome therefore chinese medicine treatment has positive impact on infectious lung diseases as well as the development of new medicinestraditional chinese medicine has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution of novel coronavirus pneumonia and plays a positive role in ncp treatment according to the clinical data from wuhan in this study multiple linear regression analysis shows that the tcm category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness improved patients recovery suggesting the vitalness of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in the tcm treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia the network pharmacology results demonstrate active compounds from qfpdd and recommended formulas by national health commission contribute to recovery of different disease progresses during tcm treating novel coronavirus pneumonia chinese medicine treatment is advantageous in treating ncp as well as the development of new medicines for infectious lung diseasescommitting to rigid shutdown measures to contain the spreading of the corona virus has been undertaken on the tacit assumption that these measures will be temporary and can be loosened when the covid-19 infection rates decrease and discontinued altogether once vaccines are available mitigating climate change and achieving ambitious temperature targets as set out in the paris agreement requires a long-term structural change taking us away from our current carbon-intensive economy to a zero-carbon and then net-negative carbon economy as current research holds out little hope that a perfect vaccine in the form of solar climate engineering will be available in the future the measures and efforts required must translate into a permanent ongoing form of commitment while progressive climate change and the spread of the coronavirus operate on very different time scales impatience about the duration of corona lockdown has indicated once more a fundamental problem for long-term environmental concerns clearly the economic and social costs associated with the emergence of the virus and the shutdown are significant helm 2020 oecd 2020 but any serious costbenefit analysis would need to take into account not only the fact that different degrees of lockdown are available but also that the overall cost is affected by the expectations of agents regarding possible future re-lockdowns due to insufficient containment of the virus seen thus it is anything but clear at which point in time the actual cost of lockdown would have exceeded the economic cost of the virus spreading in an unmitigated or insufficiently mitigated wayduring the course of lock-down measures voices calling for a green recovery stimulus package centering around low-carbon investments in the aftermath of the corona crisis have make themselves heard by contrast advocates of postponing climate mitigation-related taxes levies and regulations have also entered the fray claiming that timely recovery should not be jeopardized by any additional economic burdens the debate on the relation between economic recovery and climate policies has been conducted from three major perspectives the first of these is largely notable for general statements of intent recommending that the recovery should be green and sustainable that eu climate targets should be supported and that other environmental targets maintaining biodiversity etc need to be taken into account when designing recovery measures such well-meant counsels as the statement issued by the german national academy of sciences leopoldina 2020 are useful in reminding us that recovery from the corona crisis should not come at the expense of neglecting other objectives and that climate policy should not be back-burnered as was the case after the financial crisis in 2009 otherwise they are of little practical valuethe second approach has involved rather detailed proposals calling either for a greening of recovery by foregrounding measures to support renewable energies public transport energy efficiency etc or for a blackening of recovery by postponing andor abandoning climate measures and environmental regulations predominantly these proposals are representing the positions of the various interest groups involved for example representatives of the aviation industry try to prevent the harmonization of carbon prices on fuels with respect to kerosene and argue against the introduction of kerosene taxes this idea resurfaces in the discussion on recovery measures by say the austrian aviation association 2020 on the other hand in its comprehensive list of recovery demands the ngo german environment action 2020 urges for example for the abandonment of blue hydrogen projects though not explaining why this is likely to stimulate economic recovery various other interest groups are in favor of postponing suspending or even abandoning existing environmental and climate regulations for example janusz kowlaski the polish deputy minister of state assets urges that the ets european emissions trading scheme should be removed from january 1 2021 or at least poland should be excluded from the system1 clearly there is no point in discussing nonsensical ideas of this kind but some of these proposals also make sensible suggestions like adjusting the german cap on renewable energy installations or abandoning the eu average fleet-consumption regulation because the former contradicts german renewable-energy targets and the latter is an inefficient instrument for regulating vehicle emissions however these suggestions do nothing to provide stimulus for a quick recovery while specific processes and regulation timelines for regulations may need to be adjusted in the context of the corona crisis sensible measures of this kind should be discussed and decided upon in the regular political process confining potential stimulus and recovery measures to their proper purpose does not mean imposing a ban on meaningful climate or environmental policies that are not associated with the corona crisisthe third and most sensible perspective replaces specific proposals with sustainability assessment guidelines like those suggested by the world bank 2020 while hardly any possible recovery measure would perform well against the comprehensive list of criteria provided by the world bank such guidelines are helpful in arguing against interest group driven proposals the world bank has suggested that potential measures up for consideration as part of a recovery strategy need to be assessed against both short- and long-term criteria an example for the former being the expected economic multiplier associated with certain measures bayer et al 2020 suggest that income transfers as planned under the us cares package perform well against this specific short-term criteria they could help to stabilize private-sector spending and the multiplier could increase to 2 in the case of transfers being conditionalbut not related to emissions but to the propensity to consume ie conditional on being unemployed however private-sector spending like this should not imply any unintended adverse effects on essential long-term structural change that might arise from such things as temporarily adjusted risk preferences once postponed or stimulated demand and investment take place during the recovery process carbon-price signals are vital in providing technology-neutral incentives for low-co2 purchasing and production decisionsoverloading stimulus or recovery packages with too many emission-related conditions performs poorly against the short-term criteria with respect to a timely recovery even worse the inclusion in recovery packages of various detailed suggestions from the various interest groups usually results in a non-transparent rent-seeking and political bargaining process in which it remains unclear whether sensible individual emission-related decisions are being prioritized at the expense of a more challenging long-term climate policy accordingly accounting for the long-term criteria requires that existing or planned climate policies providing incentives for emission reductions and technological innovation should remain in place and not be postponed let alone weakened otherwise uncertain short-term recovery impulses most likely come at the cost of less efficient emission-reduction paths in the long termcovid-19 infection has become pandemic after its first outbreak in wuhan china in 2019 this infection is caused by novel sars-cov-2 virus which is distinct from its related type sars-cov the world health organization who has termed this disease as covid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 upto 09thapril 2020 1496055 cases have been confirmed globally with 89435 deaths while 336780 people got recovered across the world the most number of infected cases were from united states 432438 confirmed cases 14808 deaths and 24125 recovery of the patients followed by spain 152446 confirmed cases 15238 deaths and 52165 recovery of the patients italy 139422 confirmed cases 17669 deaths and 26491 recovery of the patients germany 113296 confirmed cases 2349 deaths and 46300 recovery of the patients france 83080 confirmed cases 10887 deaths and 21461 recovery of the patients and china 82883 confirmed cases 3339 deaths and 77678 recovery of the patients fig 1
 latter being the first epicentre of this disease this data suggests that infection due to covid-19 is spreading exponentially in new hotspots as compared to the first epicentre wuhan where new cases are in constant decline 1 at this point of time there is an urgent need of therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of covid-19 as a disease numerous researchers across the world are working on finding the cure and chemoprophylaxis of this disease with many of them are even putting their efforts to develop the vaccine recently some of the reports on hydroxychloroquine 2 3 4 ivermectin 5 and azithromycin 6 have shown therapeutic effects against novel coronavirus infection however it was not reported that which drug has better efficacy in comparison to other or a combination of them can give life saving results therefore the present report has been able to provide the comprehensive view of combining the knowledge of these drugs altogether in the context of current health emergency around the worldthe first category of drug was chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine which may act as a therapeutic agent against covid-19 infection earlier both have been used widely for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus chloroquine was initially used for the treatment of malaria but plasmodium falciparum substantially developed resistance against it with the subsequent development of new antimalarials this drug is now being used for the prophylaxis of malaria in 1946 by the introduction of hydroxyl group into chloroquine a derivative was produced known as hydroxychloroquine and was found to have less acute poisoning than the former one 7 both the drugs otherwise share a similar mechanism of action and structure these drugs tend to increase the ph within intracellular vacuoles and act as weak base in addition they are known to alter processes such as protein degradation by acidic hydrolases in the lysosome assembly of macromolecules in the endosomes and post translation modification of proteins in the golgi apparatus 8 over the past few decades this drug has received wider attention as a potential antiviral drug chang and his colleagues in 2014 revealed that hydroxychloroquine activates the host anti-viral innate immunity 9 this drug accumulates in the cellular organelles creating acidic environment to inhibit the replication of different viruses by interfering with endosomelysosome trafficking or viral protein maturation during virions maturation fig 2
 during the recent pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 hydroxychloroquine was found to act as a potential drug in fighting against covid-19 some of the in vitro and poorly controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials revealed that this drug has activity against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sarscov-2 2 3 4 in china clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine are further in-progress for the treatment and management of covid-19 disease nct04261517 and nct04307693another study revealed that ivermectin which is a broad spectrum anti-parasitic drug demonstrated its efficacy against covid-19 which comes as a second line of drug 5 ivermectin is fda approved drug known to have wide-spectrum antiviral activity against number of viruses under in vitro conditions 10 11 12 13 sars-cov-2 causative agent of covid-19 is a single stranded rna virus positive sense which is closely related to sars coronavirus sars-cov recent study on ivermectin against sars-cov-2 under in vitro conditions revealed that it can inhibit the viral replication the single treatment of this drug was able to reduce the virus up to 5000-fold in culture within 48h however no further reduction was reported with further increase in time period ie up to 72h moreover no toxicity was seen with the drug at any point of time 5 mechanism by which ivermectin responded against the cov-19 virus is not known and was believed to be working similarly as it acted on other viruses it was known to inhibit the nuclear import of viral and host proteins integrase protein of viruses and the importin imp 1 heterodimer was responsible for in nuclear import which further increases the infection fig 2 as most of the rna viruses are dependent upon imp1 during infection ivermectin acts on it and inhibits the import with the increase in antiviral response 5 14third category of therapeutic drug is azithromycin which is a class of antibiotics known as macrolide used to treat infections like bronchitis pneumonia and mac mycobacterium avium complex infection with the spread of the sars-cov-2 viral pneumonia which started in wuhan china many countries of the world started developing countermeasures in order to decrease the spread of the disease researchers found that apart from hydroxychloroquine another fda approved drug known as azithromycin was shown to have therapeutic effects against covid-19 in a study done by a research group at new mexico university the researchers were able to prove that azithromycin acted as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base which modulate the ph of endosomes and trans-golgi network fig 2 this further led to in vitro effects on intracellular organelles similar to the one as conferred by hydroxychloroquine 6 this further indicates that this antimicrobial drug has an immense therapeutic value as far as the treatment of covid-19 patients is concerned clinical trials need to be carried out with this drug as it can act as a prophylaxis for declining the infection ratethese drugs have been shown to have a potential broad-spectrum antiviral response in vitro against many viruses including coronaviruses however hydroxychloroquine has been found to be associated with dangerous side-effects in the past if the dosage is not carefully controlled there have been many cases of chloroquine poisoning reported in nigeria and the usa as well due to sudden rapid increase in demand of the above broad-spectrum drugs may lead to significant shortage for patients who rely on these drugs to treat their other disorders like malaria rheumatoid arthritis among others therefore adequate buffer stocks should be maintained for these drugs to overcome potential scarcity of the above-mentioned drugsall three categories of drugs seem to act against novel coronavirus infection however further research using large cohort of samples with randomized controlled clinical trials are urgently required for each drug alone and in-combination in order to find a concrete solution against covid-19 infectionthe author has no conflict of interest to declarethe source of origin of coronavirus is still a mystery however early investigations have reported its possible origin from the wuhan seafood wholesale market most of the early patient history associated with their movement to that seafood market whereas there were numerous other patients who have not gone to that market in those days that association indicated its human to human transmission in spreading the outbreak few environmental samples taken from the market have been reported positive but no specific animal was identified as its origin7 an initial investigation based on codon claimed snake as an origin8 it has also been proposed that 2019-ncov naturally propagates in bats9 previous study revealed that wet markets of southern china including wuhan and guangzhou cities have the greater risk of spreading novel corona viruses because of wild animal trading and the absence of biosecurity measures10 the other possibility is that bats and their excrements are commonly used in traditional chinese medicine which may also be a source of infection11 it is also possible that the virus had infected other mammal that was traded at the market and served as the source of the infection to peopletwo already highly pathogenic coronaviruses were reported to be originated from the animals the transmission of the first highly pathogenic virus sars-cov occurred from animal to human in wet markets the source of sars-cov was bat which transferred this virus to human via civet cat as an intermediate host12 the bats were also reported to be the possible origin of mers-cov which is also a zoonotic virus13 however mers-cov was reported in the patients having frequent contact with the camels in the middle east dromedary camel was considered as traditional household animal to avoid contact with camel is not possible due to which they suffered from the periodic outbreak of mers-cov14 in this context the identification of source animals responsible for the transmission of covid-19 virus is extremely essential in order to control and prevent any future outbreak the possible transmission cycle of covid-19 is presented in fig1covid-19 is a great public health and safety concern all across the globe and the chinese government international agencies and who is aware of the consequences of the outbreak the first case of covid-19 outside china was reported in thailand15due to rise in infected and suspected cases of covid-19 in china by the end of the third week of january 2020 the chinese government had completely lockdown the wuhan city hubei province they partially lockdown other cities at higher risk to stop its further spreading since the public health emergency declared by who much more attention at national and international levels has been focused on covid-19 the concept of one health which means that the health of people is linked with the animal and connected environment has gained great importance in this current scenario1617the super-spreaders infected person who travels and infect others are mostly responsible for large outbreaks for example traveling of one infected person with sars-cov from hong kong to toronto infected 128 people in a local health care facility where he visited for treatment the same situation was with mers-cov where a single patient from saudi arabia traveled to south korea infected 186 patients with mers-cov18the epidemiological characteristics observed in the case of covid-19 varied to a great extent as compared to the sars-cov the 2019-ncov replicates efficiently in the upper respiratory tract but the onset of symptoms appears to be slow although the infected individual carries a huge number of virus still heshe can perform hisher normal activities which leads to the spread of this infection to other individuals whereas in the sars-cov patients the transmission of infection is not reported during the prodromal period and transmission occurs when the patient becomes severely ill7various factors affect and determine the spread of disease in an outbreak including transmissibility and severity morbidity and mortality will rely on the combination of transmissibility and severity and a rapid person to person transmission occurred in this outbreak the epidemiologists estimated the ro the basic reproduction number to measure the transmissibility value would be 22 for covid-1919the severity and the case-fatality rate could be underestimated because many infected people have not yet recovered and may deceasedafter the onset of the covid-19 outbreak the potential risk of vertical transmission was a question mark control and prevention of this novel emerging infection among pregnant women have become a primary concern regarding vertical transmissibility the latest study published in the lancet gives some insight into the clinical features during pregnancy and potential of vertical transmission covid-19 infection in pregnant women20 although the research manipulates only a small number of nine pregnant women with confirmed covid-2019 no evidence for intrauterine infection was reported in late pregnancy in these cases21a sars-cov-2 genomic study suggested that this virus has 88 genetic similarity with two sars-like coronaviruses isolated from a bat sbat-sl-covzc45 and bat- sl-covzxc21 while in case of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov bats genome similarities were 79 and 50 respectively homology studies have shown that sars-cov-2 has a similar receptor binding structure to that of sars-cov-1 so the ability of vertical transmission of corona-19 could be as low as that of sars-cov-122although 2019-ncov has adverse effects on newborn including shortening of breathing premature birth and liver disorder but its vertical transmission has not proved23 the clinical findings of covid-19 infected pregnant women were same as non-pregnant women infected with covid-19 infection24in accordance with sars-cov and mers cov this new virus was observed to affect more males than female individuals the reduced susceptibility of women can be explained by the fact that the sex hormone and x chromosome play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity moreover almost half of the population infected by covid-19 has underlying problems mainly diabetes cerebrovascular and cardiovascular problems similar to mers-cov the older people with the weak or compromised immune system are more susceptible to this disease 24among the clinical signs fever dry cough dyspnea and fatigue were common in all cases upper respiratory tract infection ie rhinorrhea sneezing or sore throat were also uncommon in covid-19 the laboratory reports of covid-19 patients indicates lymphopenia decrease in white blood cells which suggested the destruction of lymphocyte and other immune cells by coronavirus leading to the weakening of cellular immune system25 some patients suffer from acute respiratory distress and septic shock which lead to the failure of multiple organs24-26 these cases are of crucial importance to be treated at earlier stages ct scan indicated ground-glass opacification and occasional consolidation in the patients27most of the deaths have been reported in the patients who have the characteristic of warning signs described by the multi logistic binary search tree analysis mulbsta model these six signs which are included in the mulbsta model are multinodular infiltration lymphopenia bacterial co-infection smoking history hypertension and age28few or no options are available for treating a viral disease that emerged suddenly no vaccine has been developed yet for the prevention of covid-19 infection26 a combination of antiviral drugs lopinavirritonavir pegylated interferon and ribavirin has been used in a mers-cov case reported in south korea that helped in the successful clearance of the virus29 another viral drug remdesivir has been reported to be effective against the viral infection in-vitro studies indicated that remdesivir has been successful in the termination of viral rna replication3032 and showed effectiveness against the mers-cov sars-cov and other bat originated coronaviruses3133qamar et al 2020 screened the database of 32297 chinese medicinal plants for their antiviral activity they suggested 9 medicinal plants that might help in the prevention of viral replication34 further studies are necessary to figure out the effectiveness of these plants in this infection another study on virtual screening of a database of more than 3000 food and drug administration fda approved drugs was carried out in order to find the possible best available drug the results suggested that protein inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus hiv drugs might be helpful against the covid-1935 recently fda have authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine due to emergency situation without double blind and clinical trial for the treatment of covid-1936since the discovery of the virus the covid-19 spread very rapidly all across the countries and cases have been reported in 210 countries around the globe till 1039 gmt on april 26 2020 the data obtained showed over 24 million confirmed cases of covid-1937 higher mortality rate 15 was found in algeria belgium 1395 italy and united kingdom 13 and netherland 1135 lower mortality rate was found in countries qatar 017 singapore 02 united arab emirate 06 and australia 097  the who keeps on updating and sharing these figures on daily basis and till april 28th it had iussued ninety seven reports giving countrywise details of number of caseshigher mortality rate is related with the total number of infected cases as significant positive correlation r09 n56 was found between confirmed cases and deaths which showed that disease spread increases the risk of death due to overcrowded hospitals lower availability of medical facility and other environmental factors before mitigation measures were taken place covid-19 was already spread in the early stages38 countries showed early response suffered less than the countries that did not care in the early stage of this pandemic yet another reason of this pandemic was as 80 of covid-19 cases are mild or asymptomatic so the symptom base control of this disease is very difficult and less effectiverecovery versus deceased ratio was calculated and the data showed that recovery was 68 59 and 35 times higher than the death in singapore qatar and thailand respectively lower value of deceased over recovery ratio was found in united kingdom 003 netherland 008 ireland 016 and norway 02137 in contrast to covid-19 prevalence previous study shows that community acquired pneumonia cases were high in male who belonged to lower socio-economic group illiterate people living in rural areas39 patients recoveries are significantly correlated with the number of cases r  063 n  56 showed that recoveries are increasing with increase in number of cases the potential factors involved in the recovery might be strong immune system among the population good dietry habits and early treatment and bacillus calmette-gurin bcg vaccination policy in some country showed less cases than without bcg vaccinated nations 40according to reuter the global death due to covid19 disease passed two hundred thousand on april 25th 2020 and it is expected that the total number of infected cases will cross three million people by the end of april 2020 more than 50 of these deaths have occurred in united states spain and italy the worst hit countries till april 25th united states had reported fifty two thousand four hundred deaths while italy spain and france have reported between 22000 and 26000 fatalities each of the top twenty most severely affected countires belgium has reported highest number of fatalities per capita with six deaths per ten thousand people compared to 49 in spain and 16 in the united states the overall mortality rate of cases reported in united states has been 8 while more than 10 cases reported in spain and italy have resulted in deaths asia and latin america have each reported more than seven thousand deaths while middle east has reported more than eight thousand

this drug combination found that the effect of lopinavirritonavir on covid-19 was unsatisfactory as it only helps to improve the minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results 315chloroquine is not only used as an antimalarial drug but is also used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases due to its immunomodulatory activity 5previous studies have shown that chloroquine exerts antiviral effects through the following mechanisms
it can change the ph of acidic organelles 6 such as endosomes so inhibits infections such as borna disease virus 7 avian leukemia virus 8 and zika virus 9it can change the glycosylation pattern of the hiv virus gp120 envelope which inhibits the replication of hiv human immunodeficiency virus virus in cd4  t cells 10it can effectively inhibit autophagy in the lungs of avian influenza h5n1 mice and reduce the damage to the alveolar epithelium 11it inhibits viral replication by blocking the autophagy phenomenon induced by the zika virus and can cut off vertical infection of the zika virus from the maternal-fetal pathway 12multiple studies have found that chloroquine has anti-sars-cov activity
chloroquine can inhibit viral replication by reducing the terminal glycosylation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on vero e6 cells and interfering with the binding of sars-cov to the ace2 receptor 13 14chloroquine inhibits the replication of hcov-229e and sars-cov both belong to the -group hcovs by inhibiting the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk in the l132 human embryonic-lung-cell line 15the spike protein s protein of sars-cov-2 is similar in structure to that of sars-cov and can bind to the ace2 receptor on the host-cell surface to infect the host epithelial cells 16remdesivir gs-5734 and chloroquine sigma-c6628 can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 infection 17this study will compare the efficacy safety and impact on patient compliance between the chloroquine phosphate regimen with the lopinavirritonavir regimen in mildgeneral covid-19 infectionthis randomized controlled trial is to be conducted at the fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university the ninth peoples hospital of dongguan zhongshan second peoples hospital and jiangmen central hospitalthese hospitals are located in guangdong china the clinical research flowchart crf of the research process is shown in fig 1

software to set the number of centers at four the block size will be four the number of blocks will be 28 using a 1 1 ratio between the experimental group and the control group will generate 112 random numbers and corresponding grouping information according to the haphazard allocation table used in advance the statistical expert gives random numbers 1112 in ascending order each random number and grouping information correspond to an envelope the envelope is sealed and given to the researchers responsible for screening qualified subjects are selected and the envelopes are received in the order of enrollment after the envelopes are opened the random-number and grouping information is removed so that the subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group and the corresponding treatment and observations performed each subjects random number is unique and remains the same throughout the trialthe hypothesis of this study is that the use of chloroquine phosphate instead of lopinavirritonavir will increase the rate of throat-swab sars-cov-2 nucleic-acid negative conversionthe main therapeutic index of this study is the clinical recovery time after no more than 28 days which is from the beginning of the study drug intervention treatment to the normalization of body temperature respiratory symptoms respiratory rate and blood-oxygen saturation in the later analysis the log-rank method is used to compare the differences in clinical recovery time between the two groups of patients the sample size of this study is calculated based on the log-rank method by using the log-rank test lakatos median survival time module in the pass 110 statistical software see additional file sample size report for detailsbased on clinical experience 4 18 the median clinical recovery time of the patients in the control group is expected to be 8 days and the median clinical recovery time of patients in the experimental group can be shortened to 4 days corresponding hazard ratio hr  20 112 patients 56 in each group will be required to detect this difference with a significant level of   005 both sides with 85 confidence intervalthe trial is planned to be enrolled for 90 days followed up for 28 days and a final analysis is performed after 78 clinical recovery events occur it is estimated that the drop-out rate of the experimental group and the control group is 5the results of this study for efficacy outcomes will be analyzed based on both intention-to-treat itt and per-protocol pp approaches with a primary consideration for itt results a pp

affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university zdwy2020 lunzi no k151randomized controlled studies still have some design limitations first the sample size we use is relatively small and the 28-day treatment period is short therefore we will not be able to estimate possible relapses of pneumonia after long-term treatment second the pathophysiology of novel coronavirus pneumonia has not been elucidated as only clinician assessment is used including lung computed tomography ct results and count of viral load there is no objective indicator to judge the effect of treatment on covid-19 infection finally the follow-up period in this study was relatively short in light of these limitations we will develop a more reasonable treatment cycle and follow-up period to explore the efficacy of chloroquine in patients with covid-19we also know that there will be many biases in the open trial and we have taken a number of measures to control the possible bias in the trial as follows1 strict exclusion criteria are formulated to effectively control other confounding factors that may affect the efficacy 2 the trial uses random grouping to ensure that the two groups of patients are comparable 3 before the patient signs the informed consent form the researchers and the patients make full communication to ensure that the patients understand the entire trial content and try to eliminate the impact of the patients psychological state on the trial effect 4 the main and secondary indicators for evaluating the efficacy are objective indicators to avoid the influence of subjective factors 5 before the start of the trial the researchers will conduct unified system training to ensure the uniformity and correctness of data collection and index evaluationthe trial was

associated with a poor prognosis in laboratoryconfirmed merscov2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and nonmerscov9 10 11 patients a high mortality rate was systematically recognized in merscov patients of old age2 12 13 14 15 severe illness2 12 13 14 underlying condition2 12 13 14 and respiratorygastrointestinal symptoms2 however successful management of merscov such as clinical recovery and its predictors has not been given sufficient attention despite the virus having been in circulation since 2012as per the authors knowledge two studies have so far addressed clinical improvement on laboratoryconfirmed merscov patients16 17 the first study shalhoub et al16 was based on a case report in which their observations may not be generalized to a wider merscov population the second study alturaiki et al17 utilized publicly available data from the saudi ministry of health the major shortcomings in their study were several potential confounding factors such as underlying medical conditions and a primary or secondary mode of merscov transmission that had not been included in the analysis in addition the recovery delay was not reported in their study and thus factors related to the recovery delay were not examinedas of october 4 2017 there was no available detailed data on recovery delay of laboratoryconfirmed merscov and nonmerscov patients data on the time intervals between a patients presentation or admission to a healthcare facility and the first specimen sample have been limited in patients suspected and screened for merscov by a realtime reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction rrtpcr test as it might correlate with recovery delay intervalsearly screening and diagnosis of merscov could greatly promote proper control and clinical management of cases which may reduce the risk of transmission and increase the chance of successful outcomes18 19 20 this study provides more understanding of how long a period in days it may take to recover from merscov infection the authors have studied retrospectively a cohort of survivorslaboratoryconfirmed merscov and nonmerscov patientsto estimate recovery delay intervals and identify possible associated factors in saudi arabia the authors assessed whether the time interval between presentation and the initial rrtpcr diagnosis diagnosis delay correlates with the time interval between initial rrtpcr diagnosis and recovery recovery delay we hypothesized that older age merscov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings might be associated with longer recovery delay we hypothesized that diagnosis delay might positively correlate with a recovery delaythe analysis was conducted using ibm statistical package for social sciences spss 24 spss chicago il patients characteristics were described by count and percent and mean  standard deviation or median where appropriate time intervals in days from presentation to initial rrtpcr diagnosis diagnosis delay and from initial rrtpcr diagnosis to recovery recovery delay were analyzed by spearmans correlation coefficientthe poisson and negative binomial models were used to model the frequency of recovery delay in days and identify unadjusted and adjusted factors associated with longer recovery delay goodnessoffit measures were used to compare and identify the best model the model with the smaller deviance larger log likelihood smaller akaike information criterion and smaller bayesian information criterion was considered the better model in all analyses a pvalue of less than 5 was considered significant relative risk rr and 95 confidence intervals ci were used to assess the strength of association between patients characteristics and longershorter recovery delaya total of 396 patients suspected and screened for merscov by

recovery delay in days in a large sample of laboratoryconfirmed merscov and nonmerscov patients despite recovery delay being an important indicator of merscov infection progression it remains poorly understood in this population the data were collected from two of the largest tertiary hospitals in saudi arabia kamcr and kfghjed from september 2012 to june 2016according to our research evidence suggests that there are a number of factors that affect the course of recovery delay in suspected merscov patients whose clinical samples were evaluated by the rrtpcr test older age 65 years or over was a major predictor of longer recovery delay in our sample this was noted by alturaiki et al as well17 in other recent studies being of older age was a factor for worse clinical outcomes such as infection severity13 and death2 13 14 in merscov patients this age group has been linked to a number of preexisting medical conditions and other health risks which can also increase the risk of longer recovery delay in this population it is essential that the healthcare practitioners who provide direct medical care to suspected merscov patients most carefully monitor infection development to avoid poor outcomes in elderly patientsas expected the risk of longer recovery delay was twice as high in patients with merscov infection than patients without merscov infection this finding could be attributed to several factors merscov is a serious illness and is very common in patients in the older age group2 12 13 14 15 and patients with preexisting medical conditions2 11 12 13 14 and these seem to increase the risk of early mortality after diagnosis2 furthermore most merscov patients develop severe pneumonia22 and necessitate mechanical ventilation11 which is a risk factor for hospital mortality23
patients admitted to icu admission were at higher risk for longer recovery delay a previous report showing similar findings longer icu stay and high mortality rate was reported in merscov patients who were admitted to the icu24 such patients would benefit from monitoring their responses to medical support and recognizing potential complications at an early stagewe found that camel contact was associated with shorter recovery delay studies on recovery delay in patients with camel contact as compared to close contact exposure of a confirmed case or other exposure are lacking however camel contact has also been linked to lower 3 and 30day mortality rates in merscov patients2 this important association requires more studies to identify whether camel contact is an independent protective factor of shorter recovery delayin our study patients with respiratory symptoms are more likely to experience shorter recovery delay than patients without respiratory symptoms this finding is probably related to the shorter lag time between symptom onset and diagnosis in which patients with presence of symptoms could be positively affected by an early diagnosis18 and thus prompt medical support is deemed necessarythe time interval from presentation to initial rrtpcr diagnosis diagnosis delay was positively correlated with the time interval from initial rrtpcr diagnosis to recovery recovery delay early diagnosis is likely to improve clinical outcomes18 and reduce the economic and physical burden of a disease25 26 early diagnosis requires full utilization of hospital resources individuals at high risk of merscov infection should be promptly screened after arrival at the healthcare facility monitored for progression and then having a prompt decision made for whether further rrtpcr testing is neededthe authors noticed the following limitations first the study was based on chart reviews and findings should be interpreted with caution second we did not collect information on the type of antiviral treatment or other supportive treatments given after diagnosis which may have affected clinical outcomes27 28 third despite this being the first investigation in this population including a number of potential predictors for recovery delay additional relevant predictors should be explored such as the level of camel exposure for example hospitalacquired infections fourth patients with clinical recovery were identified by reviewing the medical records of the study sample within 60 days after the initial rrtpcr diagnosis studies with longer periods of followup in a larger population recovering from merscov are warranted to assess the longterm successful clinical outcomesdespite the mentioned limitations data were aggregated directly from medical charts rather than public source databases this chart review study was based on information from multicenters and a large sample size and it provides valuable information on factors associated with prolonged or shorter recovery delay of patients suspected and screened for merscov by the rrtpcr test it is essential to develop interventional programs or guidelines to ensure early diagnosis as this may reduce recovery delay intervals as well as improve patients clinical outcomes this research may enable identification of patients who require receiving appropriate medical support and care according to their illness progression this also may prevent spread and transmission of the infection as individuals who are still severely ill can be appropriately isolated and managed apart from others who are responding to medical carethe study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients with older age merscov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings in a sample of patients diagnosed by rrtpcr recovery delay was significantly shorter in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation a prospective study is needed to evaluate the impact of camel exposure on recovery evidence was found of an increasing recovery delay with a longer diagnosis delay the findings may help understand clinical decision making as it directs hospital resources toward prompt screening monitoring and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategiesthere are no conflict of interestssevere acute respiratory syndrome sars has affected more than 8 thousand patients in 22 countries causing 774 deaths between july 2002 and september 2003 1 sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov has been identified as the causative agent 2 typical clinical manifestations include fever cough dyspnea and rapid progression of pulmonary infiltration or consolidation 3 the mean mortality rate is 96 1 mostly attributed to hypoxemic respiratory failure in the acute phase typical pathological findings in the lungs include mononuclear cells infiltration alveolar cell desquamation and hyaline membrane formation 4 those mononuclear cells may develop into multinucleated giant cells 4 proinflammatory cytokines released by alveolar macrophages may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis in sars 5 marked elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and il-12 of the th1 cytokine ifn- and of chemokines il-8 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 and ifn--induced protein-10 ip-10 have been reported 6 high resolution computed tomography hrct findings at presentation include as unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral or bilateral areas of consolidation 7-9 such residual abnormalities have been described also after discharge from hospital at 365 days and at 6-months 1011 however limited information is available on recovery of inflammatory abnormalities during recovery from sars particularly at 60 days and beyondin the current study we conducted a study to examine hrct changes in patients who recovered from the acute phase of sars at days 60 and 90 and measured the associated inflammatory profiles directly by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf we also examined the presence of coronavirus in balf we found persistence of hrct abnormalities and of lung inflammation at day 60 and determined retrospectively the potential influence of pulse corticosteroid therapy in this processtwelve 9 women and 3 men aged 18 to 51 years of 28 confirmed sars patients who were treated in chang gung

current or past history of pulmonary diseases based on history as well as physical chest radiographic and bronchoscopic examinations were selected as controls for this study none of them had any upper respiratory tract infection within the last 6 weeks or was on antibiotics or other medications at the time of evaluationthe study protocol was approved by chang gung memorial hospital ethical committee informed consent was obtained from all the subjects treatment of sars patients on admission to our unit included broad spectrum antibiotics to target common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia according to current recommendations 1314 these patients received variable therapy regimens including oral ribavirin 1 g twice a day for 57 days or intravenous

corticosteroid therapy prednisolone 10 mg twice a day for more than 3 weeks pulse steroid therapy was administered within 3 days of the onset of fever in some patients depending on the attending physicians decision irrespective of severity of presentation some patients who did not receive pulse steroid therapy were given a short course of corticosteroid therapy hydrocortisone 100 mg 3 timesday for 3 days if there was rapid deterioration of pulmonary infiltration or hypoxemia maintenance steroid therapy prednisolone 10 mg per day for one week was given after pulse or short course corticosteroid therapy in all patients two patients were intubated with ventilator support because of hypoxemic respiratory failurepatients underwent hrct and bal on the 60th and 90th day after the onset of disease hrct was performed with 1- to 2-mm collimation sections reconstructed by the use of a high spatial frequency algorithm using a general electric medical systems milwaukee wi the hrct

period sixteen patients received intubation and ventilatory support for respiratory failure three died of intractable hypoxemic respiratory failure twenty-five patients recovered subsequently and were discharged from the hospital no patient relapsed with either fever or new pulmonary infiltrates after discharge from the hospital twenty of the 25 patients were randomly selected into the protocol and twelve agreed to participate these patients complied with the protocol at 60 days but at 90 days only 10 of 12 patients agreed to have a repeat hrct and 6 of 12 patients had a follow-up bronchoscopyat 60 days the commonest symptoms in sars patients were general weakness 8 of 12 patients exertional dyspnea 6 of 12 patients joint pains 4 of 12 patients and partial hair loss 11 of 12 patients at 90 days all the 12 sars patients were well without any of the above-described symptoms there was no detectable sars-cov antibody in the sera of close contact relatives of the study patients even though sars patients were not isolated after discharge from hospital from their close relativesat 60 days 5 sars patients were found with an hrct abnormality of 10  of the total lung field in 3 the score was

patients were found normal on their follow-up hrct at 90 days table 2 figure 1 two of the patients had persistently high hrct scores table 1 one with very high hrct score at 60 days refused a follow-up hrctthe residual abnormality on hrct at 60 days was related to the clinical course univariate analysis identified 3 factors associated with the residual abnormality on hrct there were a greater proportion of patients receiving pulse steroid therapy 4 of 7 in patients with high hrct score table 2 in contrast none of the patients with low hrct score received pulse steroid therapy table 2 there was no significant difference in other therapy including maintenance or short course corticosteroid therapy ivig or ribavirin between patients with high hrct score and those with low hrct score table 2 patients with high hrct score had significantly longer course of fever and higher serum sars-cov antibody titer when compared to those in patients with low hrct score table 2at 60 days compared to normal subjects there was a significant increase in total cell counts in bal fluid from sars patients table 3 with a significant increase in alveolar macrophages am and lymphocytes the proportion of cd8 t cells was increased to a greater extent than cd4 t cells leading to a significant decrease in cd4cd8 ratio table 4 there was also a significant increase in the proportion of nk cells in sars patients table 4 there was no significant difference in b lymphocytes between sars patients with low or high hrct scores and normal subjects hrct scores were highly correlated with the cell counts of total lymphocyte cd4 and cd8 t cells and inversely related to the cd4cd8 ratio figure 2 at 90 days the cellular profiles in bal fluid of 6 sars patients were significantly improved compared with those at 60 days with near normalization tables 3 4at 60 days sars patients had a significantly higher level of chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and rantes table 5 and of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf- and il-6 however the growth factors transforming growth factor- tgf- epidermal growth factor egf insulin-like growth factor-1 igf-1 were not increased table 5the 12 enrolled patients had serological evidence of recent infection with the sars-cov and in seven viral rna was detected in samples taken from nasopharyngeal aspirate or stool however viral rna was not detectable in the stool or nasopharyngeal aspirate of any of the sars patients at 60 days healthy controls had no evidence of sars-cov antibody or rna in the serum or the respiratory tract there were no detectable common viruses including influenza viruses a and b rsv virus adenovirus human metapneumovirus and parainfluenzavirus types 1 2 and 3 using ifa for nasopharyngeal aspirates or using rt-pcr assay for cells retrieved by bal at 60 or 90 days serological studies for clamydia mycoplasma or legionella were negative in all subjectsat 60 days em examination of bal fluid revealed many coronavirus-infected alveolar macrophages with intracellular viral particles in 7 of 12 patients figure 3 table 1 these patients had the high hrct scan scores coronavirus infected cells were not detected in any of sars patients with low hrct score or in normal subjects table 1 rt-pcr amplification of coronavirus nucleic acids was positive in 3 of 7 patients with high hrct score but in none of patients with low hrct score or normal subjects at 90 days em examination did not detect any coronavirus-infected cells in 6 sars patients in 5 of the 6 viral inclusions were found in am at day 60 table 1 one patient with persistent high hrct score case 12 refused follow-up bal study at 90 daysthis study was performed during the last epidemic of sars in taiwan and the number of patients recruited has been limited the epidemic did not recur during 2004 and there have been no further cases of sars in taiwan such that we were not able to increase the number of patients in this study despite the relatively low numbers our observations indicate that there are persistent important inflammatory and radiological abnormalities in some patients who have recovered from acute sars at 60 days after the illness these changes were those of ground-glass orand consolidation abnormalities which may be overlooked on examination of plain chest radiographs the bal fluid examination performed for the first time in recovering sars patients confirmed the presence of an on-going active inflammatory process in most patients with increased macrophages nk cells and t cells and augmented levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines these inflammatory responses may be elicited by the persistent presence of coronavirus in alveolar macrophages since the patients with the highest hrct changes had coronaviruses present and there was no evidence of bacterial or other viral infection in these patientsmost viral diseases are characterized by the development of a specific infiltration consisting predominantly of mononuclear leukocytes while neutrophils are absent 19 the most striking features of alveolar inflammation in patients were increased numbers of alveolar macrophages t lymphocytes and nk cells with a striking decrease in cd4cd8 ratio the hrct score was highly correlated with t lymphocyte numbers and their subpopulations and was inversely related to cd4cd8 ratio cd8 t cells may act as cytotoxic cells and are key effectors of virus clearance 20 the concurrent increase in cd4 t cells may promote the clonal expansion of virus-specific cd8 t cells and is essential for maintaining continued cd8 t cells surveillance and effector capacity 19exposure of monocytes or macrophages to viruses causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 and il-6 and chemokines 20-22 as well as members of the cc-chemokine subfamily such as mip-l mcp-1 and rantes which preferentially attract monocytes and lymphocytes 22 the cxc-chemokines such as il-8 or gro- are major neutrophil chemoattractants 23 migcxc chemokine ligand cxcl 9 and ip-10cxcl10 both inducible by interferon- are elr-negative cxc chemokines and are potent chemoattractants for mononuclear cells specifically activated t lymphocytes and nk cells 24 in this report we demonstrated elevated levels of tnf- il-6 mcp-1 rantes and il-8 in bal fluid in sars patients compared to those of normal subjects increased secretion of tnf- and il-6 may be derived from virus-infected macrophages or from cd4 or cd8 t cells and these cytokines may promote t-lymphocyte extravasation and macrophage activation 19 but such processes may not be sufficient on their own to recruit and activate mononuclear cells in virus-infected lungs the increased levels of mcp-1 and rantes in bal fluid of all sars patients may be responsible for the generation of mononuclear infiltrates observed after coronavirus infection ip-10 and mig whose levels are also increase in sars patients recruit monocytes and macrophages nk cells and activated but not resting t lymphocytes 2526although there were increased levels of il-8 in bal fluid in sars patients the number of neutrophils in balf were sparse the absence of neutrophil infiltration in influenza a virus or respiratory syncytial viruses rsv infection is attributed to the suppression of neutrophil attracting cxc-chemokines or by induction of il-10 27 however il-8 production can be induced by measles virus infection of fibroblasts 28 and by influenza a virus rsv and rhinovirus in pulmonary epithelial cells or am 28-31 the reasons for the lack of neutrophil recruitment in response to elevated il-8 levels in sars patients are not known and this deserves further investigationdespite the presence of virus in am at 60 days when patients had already been discharged from hospital these patients were not infectious because none of their close contact relatives developed any detectable sars-cov antibody in their sera the hrct and the clinical course until the 90th day of illness did not suggest any evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in sars patients this was in accord with the low level of cytokines and growth factors responsible for tissue repairing and fibrosis 32 such as il-1 tgf- igf-1 and egf detected in bal fluid however evidence of fibrosis on hrct has been obtained on hrct scans particularly in patients with very severe disease during the acute phase of sars 33the use of corticosteroids together with ribavirin has been reported to confer clinical benefit although randomized clinical trials to support its clinical efficacy are not available pulse steroid therapy was reported to lead to less oxygen requirement better radiographic outcome and less likelihood to require rescue pulse steroid therapy than their counterparts 34 however corticosteroids have been shown to increase mortality of pneumovirus-infected mice by accelerating replication of virus 35 pulse steroid therapy was also reported to be associated with residual abnormality on hrct in sars patients after discharge from hospital 10 in the current retrospective non-randomized series pulse steroid therapy appeared to be associated with delayed resolution of pneumonitis we have planned a prospective future study on investigating the effect of pulse steroid therapy in case of future outbreaks of sars this is because this issue is extremely important in outcome from sarsin conclusion a proportion of recovered sars patients have delayed resolution of pneumonitis and delayed clearance of coronavirus in the alveolar space at day 60 this was associated with persistent inflammatory response characterized by macrophages t cells particularly cd8 t cells and nk cells and by increase in cytokines and chemokines this host inflammatory response against sars-cov infection may contribute to persistent hrct abnormalities during recovery phase of sars on the other hand we found no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in sars patients during recovery at day 90 many of the abnormalities have disappeared patients recovering from sars need to be followed up for at least 3 months after the infectionthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first identified in a few unusual pneumonia patients linked to the wuhan seafood wholesale market in china in december 2019 1 however it soon grew out of china and the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was declared a pandemic on 11 march 2020 and has been reported in 216 countries areas or territories 2 while the epidemic has slowed down in china due to the strict quarantine and preventive regulations the numbers of covid-19 patients ie 10021401 as of 28 june 2020 and confirmed deaths ie 499913 as of 28 june 2020 are rapidly increasing 2 and have surpassed that of other viruses in the coronavirus family with similar genomes to sars-cov-2 for example sars which emerged in 2003 infected 8098 patients and caused 774 deaths across 29 countries the middle east respiratory syndrome mers which appeared in 2012 led to 2494 patients and 858 deaths across 27 countries 36 the healthcare systems in many countries such as the usa spain italy france uk turkey and iran have been overwhelmed and struggling with the soaring number of patients 7although our understanding of covid-19s epidemiology is evolving it is assumed that sars-cov-2 is mainly transmitted via droplets and close contacts with people carrying the virus 2 however recent reports have also proposed the possibility of the virus being contracted via various surfaces gastrointestinal transmission 8 and potentially airborne exposures 2 9 based on the existing evidence elderly population those with suppressed immune systems and underlying metabolic cardiovascular or respiratory diseases are at an increased risk for adverse outcomes however recent reports from outside china point to a considerable risk of severe outcomes among the general adult population ie 65 years old 10 11as we continue to learn more about covid-19 and its characteristics there are many unknowns about its epidemiology such as hospitalisation and recovery-related outcomes that are critical for healthcare system preparedness 12 13 for example the mean number of incubation days for covid-19 varies greatly across the existing literature ranging from 25 14 to 20 days 15 16 our understanding of time from contracting the disease to recovery or death is even more limited in this systematic review and meta-analysis we tried to identify the studies that recruited patients diagnosed with covid-19 and calculate pooled estimates for several epidemiological and clinical outcomes to help provide an overall picture of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 findings of this study could help inform the ongoing public health and public policy practices across the worldfollowing the systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma checklist see supplementary table s1 and the peer review of electronic search strategies press guideline 17 18 we searched pubmed embase and google scholar from 1 december 2019 to 11 march 2020 for studies that measured and reported several characteristics of covid-19 eg incubation period hospitalisation death search terms were combined using appropriate boolean operators and included subject heading termskeywords relevant to covid-19 eg novel coronavirus sars-cov2 coronavirus disease please see supplementary table s2 for our sample search strategyquantitative studies were included in the review if they reported incubation period of of sars-cov-2 as well as time from onset of the symptoms to first medical visit intensive care unit icu admission recovery as defined by studies authors or death studies were also included if they reported the number of deaths among patients with a confirmed covid-19 diagnosis studies were included in the meta-analysis if they provided data on the above-mentioned outcomes along with their standard error and sample size case-reports with a sample size of one were removed from the meta-analysis as they did not provide any dispersion estimate studies were not excluded based on language location or measurement method given that this study used

and metaprop for binary variables commands the 95 confidence intervals ci for binary variables were computed using the exact binomial method heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using both the i2 statistic with a cut-off of 50 and the 2 test with p-value 010 19 as all results turned out to be significantly heterogeneous we used random-effects models to calculate the pooled point estimate and 95 ci for the cfr mean time from onset of covid-19 symptoms to first medical visit icu admission recovery and death for the mean incubation period we estimated 99 ci we also conducted a random-effects meta-regression using statas metareg command to identify the sources of heterogeneity and explored the effect of study-level covariates where data were available supplementary table s3 meta-regression was considered when there were at least 10 studies included in the meta-analysis 20 a two-sided p-value 005 was considered as statistically significantwe found a total of 1675 non-duplicate studies 57 of which were included in the qualitative synthesis and 43 were included in the meta-analysis fig 1 a description of the main characteristics of the included studies is provided in table 1 the 57 studies included 27 cross-sectional one case-control one retrospective cohort and 28 case seriescase report studies with sample sizes ranging greatly from one in case-reports to 58 182 for a study in the hubei province 21 inclusion criteria varied greatly across the studies but most study participants were hospitalised patients living or travelling from various provinces in china median range age of the participants was 462 range 17 days to 785 years and about 60 were male most studies were conducted between january and february 2020 clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients included in the study are presented in table 2 among studies that reported exposure history among their participants most patients were directly or indirectly traced back to the city wuhan eg lived in wuhan or had recently travelled to wuhan and the huanan seafood market in hubei province china several cases of contracting sars-cov-2 through close contacts with family members were also reported across the studies frequent ct or x-ray findings included thickened texture of the lungs bilateral focal consolidation lobar consolidation ground-glass opacity patchy consolidation and unilateralbilateral pneumonia common symptoms reported across the studies included fever cough shortness of breath and fatigueweakness only 15 studies reported some information about the pre-existing conditions of the patients most of whom had metabolic and cardiovascular underlying conditions

we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 based on the existing evidence as of 11 march 2020 our findings suggest that covid-19 has an average incubation period of 568 days and there is a lag of 492 days from onset of symptoms to the first clinical visit on average the symptoms of the patients lasted less than 20 days 1855 days before recovery was achieved and the cfr among confirmed covid-19 patients was 2 which significantly increased by age similar to previous studies 77 fever dry cough shortness of breath and fatigue were common symptoms among the patients in the included studies as expected history of direct or indirect exposure to wuhan was frequently reported the most common radiologic findings were bilateral consolidation and pneumonia 78 79we found the average incubation period of covid-19 infection to be less than 6 days which is broadly consistent with previously reported estimates 23 29 80 81 the right tail of the 99 ci of the incubation period for covid-19 was less than 7 days 659 this finding is of particular interest as there are many uncertainties about the incubation period of covid-19 for example both the world health organization and centers for disease control and prevention in the usa suggest an incubation period of 214 days however single outlier cases as long as 19 47 24 15 or 27 days 16 have been reported estimates that are possibly reflecting a double exposure our findings are of particular importance for quarantine-related policies and planning and suggest that the current 14-day quarantine period might be rather conservative indeed we found that except for one small study from china in anyang city on a cluster of six patients 47 all other studies reported incubation periods less than 106 days therefore a shorter period of 14 days would suffice and almost all people exposed to sars-cov-2 would show symptoms within 11 days of their initial exposure all in all decisions to modify or keep the existing policies need to weigh the costs of extending active quarantine against the potential or costs of missing a few patients with delayed-onset symptomscovid-19 seems to have a longer incubation period than that of other acute respiratory viral infections such as human coronavirus 32 days influenza a 143164 days parainfluenza 26 days respiratory syncytial virus 44 days and rhinovirus 14 days 82 83 furthermore the median incubation period for sars has been estimated as 40 days in 2009 82 which is considerably lower than what we observed for covid-19 the longer incubation period of the covid-19 may be one of the major factors that helps explain its rapid spread in comparison with previous respiratory infection viruses other factors contributing to the spread of covid-19 are the lag between the onset of symptoms and first clinical visit ie 492 days and the high number of asymptomatic covid-19 patients these findings suggest that mers and sars patients may progress to severe symptoms and respiratory failures 84 much faster than most covid-19 patients 85in comparison to mers with a fatality rate of 3567 86 and sars with a fatality rate of 11 87 we found covid-19 to have a much lower cfr 2 that significantly increased by age 56 increase for every 10-year increase although this estimate is comparable with previous studies 40 88 it is important to recognise the limitations of calculating fatality rates of covid-19 while the epidemic is still growing as most covid-19 patients remain asymptomatic and may recover without seeking medical care it is likely that the true cfr among people infected with sars-cov-2 could be even lower on the other hand the estimated fatality rates reported in most studies need to be interpreted with caution as they are often based on the cumulative number of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases while patients who die on a given day have been infected at a much earlier date and this would bias the denominator used to calculate the fatality rate 89we acknowledge four main limitations of our systematic review first our findings are mainly based on studies that recruited patient from clinics and hospitals and therefore may be biased towards more severe cases moreover our data might be skewed towards early reporting from provinces in china and outcomes might be different in other countries in the western context we are therefore aiming to update the review as more data become available in the next 12 months to provide more accurate estimates second many studies did not report the study outcomes by subgroups such as age or sex and we could not report group-specific outcomes third we used the mean and the standard error of the incubation period assuming a normal distribution which may have led to the underestimation of the right tail of the distribution lastly given the urgency of the topic and the heterogeneity of the studies included in the review we did not conduct the risk of bias or quality assessment of the studies given the emerging nature of covid-19 and the observational study design of most of the available evidence most studies in the review are at a high risk of bias and the quality of existing evidence is relatively low nonetheless our systematic review of literature provides an insightful picture of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 which could inform ongoing public health and public policy decision makingsour findings of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 provide important insight into healthcare systems prevention and planning efforts the incubation period ie 11 days in most studies and the lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis ie 5 days are longer for covid-19 compared to other respiratory viral infections including mers and sars current policies of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone potentially exposed to sars-cov-2 might be too conservative and longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases as effective vaccination or treatment for covid-19 are yet to be developed practising the fundamentals of public health and prevention science such as physical distancing and personal hygiene are critical and need to be emphasised and enforced further to reduce the risk of sars-cov-2 transmissionthe expectation of huge amounts of public money being distributed at short notice brings interest groups of every shade to the scenepreferably with old wish lists on hand consequently there is a big risk that recovery programs will be captured by interest groups for an overview of the literature on regulatory capture see dal bo 2006 on the one hand climate change mitigation is put under pressure as being an extra burden for industries for example european car manufacturers have called for postponing the upcoming tightening of eu emission standards for car fleets topham and harvey 2020 some eu member states call for stalling the eu commissions plan of a european green deal simon 2020 on the other hand many recommend spending the public money mainly on measures that also help mitigating climate changeamong them frans timmermans executive vice-president of the european commission schulz 2020 or fatih birol head of the international energy agency birol 2020there is one thing that must not be overlooked in this politico-economic competition public funds are still short and must be used reasonably otherwise ill-designed green subsidies can quickly turn into a part of the problem instead of being the solution previous cash for clunkers programs warn as an example of a misguided recovery measure these programs were introduced in many countries after the 2009 financial crisis and provided financial incentives to trade old less fuel-efficient cars for new more efficient ones empirical analyses have shown very mixed results regarding both the economic as well as the environmental stimulus effects of these measures grigolon et al 2016 li et al 2013 mian and sufi 2012 at the beginning of every discussion about green recovery programs it is therefore important to develop transparent and sensible criteria based on which public aid should be allocatedafter the initial bail-out programs public recovery programs to stabilize the economy are now debated politically certainly this generates an unprecedented window of opportunity for structural transformation moreover the distribution of public aid may also justify committing beneficiaries to public interests to a certain extent consequently the currently available political degrees of freedom should be used to promote the transition of society towards sustainability subsidies to branches like tourism aviation and agriculturewhich are particularly hit by the crisis and are lagging behind in terms of sustainabilityshould be paid conditional on meeting minimum environmental standards new investments into long-lived fossil-fueled assets must be avoided a recovery program cannot only be about re-establishing the status quo ante by assigning large public funds possibly creating new barriers for sustainability transitions in this respect it makes sense to implement recovery programs that are in line with the objective of mitigating climate changeas called for by many at the moment however such green recovery programs must not be arbitrarygreen recovery programs must go beyond green subsidies first of all it is also important to reduce unnecessary barriers for green investments for example by revising legal constraints to the expansion of renewable energies like solar photovoltaics of wind power moreover any green recovery program can only effectively and efficiently spur decarbonization if it combines with a carbon price and the abolition of environmentally harmful subsidies the direction of recovery must be crystal-clear otherwise green subsidies risk being ineffective and costly approaches to mitigating climate change kalkuhl et al 2013 palmer and burtraw 2005 while imposing additional burdens on public budgets and reducing political degrees of freedom in the future for subsidies to be economically justified they need to meet clear criteriafor green recovery programs to succeed in the competition for public funds with other important policy fields such as health or digitalization they must help stabilize the economy moreover policy-makers need to be aware that some of the currently observed economic problems might even resolve without any government aid it can expected for example that global supply chains will resume and that people will catch up on purchasing durable goods like cars at least partly it is exactly the maintenance of environmental regulation that may help steer this consumption towards more sustainable modesgovernment interventions must take effect where permanent disruptions are looming one example innovative green business models may particularly be at risk if banks limit loans in the presence of the current uncertainties lehmann and sderholm 2018 in this case government loans may provide direct assistance in contrast attempts to lower prices for goods and serviceseg for cars vat reduction purchase premiums or electricity reduction of energy leviesare rather inappropriate means to stabilize the economy such measures fail to address the actual sources of insufficient investments or reduced purchasing power and are therefore inefficient ways of spending public budgets furthermore it is unclear whether and to what extent such discounts will be passed through to final consumers by market prices peltzman 2000green recovery programs should focus on government interventions that would also have been economically reasonable without the covid-19 crisisfor example to correct market failures next to the co2 externality bennear and stavins 2005 fischer and newell 2008 lehmann 2012and that have the highest priority for climate policy moreover those measures should be implemented for which rational concepts have been drafted already and that can be realized promptly positive examples of such no-regret measures can be found in the transport sector for instance this sector is severely lagging behind in terms of climate change mitigation and economic rationales for public expenditures exist at least partly briggs et al 2015 low and astle 2009 in addition to that numerous actors have already developed elaborated programs of measures those measures that can be implemented quickly should now be launchedfor instance to electrify the transport sector or to strengthen public transportgreen recovery programs must not only address the expenditure side a currently still disregarded issue is the question how the required billions of euro could be raised public expenditures for a green recovery program should at least partly be funded by polluters by implementing a carbon price and abandoning ecological harmful subsidies such policies internalizing environmental costs would not be an extra sacrificebut rather part of the solution both for revenue problems and for the redirection towards sustainability for a review of the double-divident hypothesis see goulder 2013the coronavirus crisis has opened up a window of opportunity for transformation this should be used without getting off the regulatory track green recovery programs must not be reduced to a mere competition for green subsidies abandoning barriers to green investments and imposing a carbon price are equally important where economically sensible green subsidies should contribute both to stabilizing the economy and mitigating climate change moreover smart green recovery programs may contribute to raising revenues for the additionally necessary public expendituressevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two sars-cov-2 the causative agent of novel coronavirus covid-19 or 2019-ncov has emerged in late 2019 which is believed to be originated from hubei province china called wuhan 16 25 2019-ncov or covid-19 is rapidly spreading in humans which is evidently believed that it was first derived from bats transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts probably the raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides and palm civet paguma larvata 8 18 21 the major symptoms of sars-cov-2 include fever cough and shortness of breath which in many instances appeared to be similar to that flu 16 covid-19 had since reached a decisive point and pandemic potential which claimed the lives of many people across the world and human-to-human transmission of covid-19 from infected individuals with mild symptoms have been reported 16 20 according to worldometers covid-19 pandemic affects 210 countries and territories around the world and 2 02 international conveyances with 6033875 confirmed cases 2661213 recovered cases and 366894 deaths as of may 30th 2020 0537 gmt 27 however there is no drug or vaccine clinically proven to treat covid-19 pandemic therefore other non-clinical or non-medical therapeutic techniques are urgently needed to contain and prevent further outbreak of covid-19 pandemic such as data mining techniques machine learning and expert system among other artificial intelligence techniquesdata mining dm is an advanced artificial intelligence ai technique that is used for discovering novel useful and valid hidden patterns or knowledge from dataset 6 14 the technique reveals relationships and knowledge or patterns among the dataset in several or single datasets 15 16 it has also widely used for the prognosis and diagnosis of many diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov that were so far discovered in 2003 and 2012 respectively 16 as huge dataset generated around the world related to 2019-ncov pandemic everyday is a treasured resource to be mined and analyzed for useful valid and novel knowledge or patterns extraction for better decision-making to contain the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic in healthcare sector data mining has been widely applied in many different applications such as predicting patient outcomes modeling health outcomes hospital ranking and evaluation of treatment effectiveness and infection control stability and recovery 1 23 29in this study we developed several data mining models for the prediction of 2019-ncov-infected patients recovery the models predict when covid-19 infected patients would be recovered and released from isolation centers as well as patients that may likely not be recovered and lost their lives to covid-19 pandemic the models help the health workers to determine the recovery and stability of the newly infected persons with pandemic covid-19 the models are developed with the dataset obtained from korea centers for disease and prevention kcdc and dataset instances of the death and recovery records of the infected 2019-ncov pandemic were considered data mining algorithm which includes decision tree support vector machine naive bayes logistic regression random forest and k-nearest neighbor were applied directly on the dataset using python programming language to develop the modelsthe rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the overall methodology of the proposed system including data collection and preparation with data mining techniques the experimental results with detailed discussions are described in sect 3 lastly sect 4 concludes the paperthe dataset was obtained from kcdc which was made available on kagge website 3 we used the epidemiological dataset of covid-19 patients of south korea the dataset has 3254 instances with 8 attributes which include patient id global number the number given by kcdc sex birth year age country province city disease true underlying diseasefalse no disease infection case infection order the order of infection infected by the id of who infected the patient contact number the number of contacts with people symptom onset date the date of symptom onset confirmed date the date of being confirmed released date the date of being released deceased date the date of being deceased and state state of the patients isolatedreleaseddeceasedthe dataset was prepared and cleaned where only relevant attributes were extracted from the original dataset the extracted dataset has only 1505 data instances with 5 attributes which include gender age infectioncase and nodays the number of days between the date the disease was confirmed and date the patients was released or die and state of the patients released or deceased we considered only two states of the patient which include released and deceased while isolation state was excluded table 1 revealed the data type of the attributes and table 2 showed the sample of some instances of the dataset the missing value in the dataset reduces the prediction power and produces biased estimates leading to an invalid conclusion 28 therefore we used last observation carried forward imputation technique to handle the missing values in the dataset figures 1 2

used when the dependent variable has two values such as 0 and 1 yes and no or true and false and thus it is called binary logistic regression 22 however when the dependent variable has more than two values multinomial logistic regression is used a mathematical model of a set of explanatory variables for lr is used to predict a transformation of the dependent variables lr transformation is written

many growth models have been very recently applied to study the evolution of the covid-19 infection3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 in 1 we tried to analyze the time evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy using a logistic model11 at the beginning of the study and after with a generalization of that modelthe logistic behaviour assumes that growth stops when maximum sustainable population density is reached through the carrying capacity k that depends on the environmental conditions for example the ordinances of the prime minister gconte the peoples hygiene habits are encoded in the carrying capacity kwe observe as the generalized model of 1 works very well until the april 7 after this date the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked at first in italy pharyngeal swabs were initially made only on seriously ill people this choice gave us the possibility to have a sample of the infected that we can describe with a single population model after april 7 it becomes impossible so we decided to use a different model to describe the new trend of the data and try to give different scenarios of the descent phase of the virus in italy in the time window february 24-may 5 in 1 we described two different peaks the peak of the infected and the deaths one in this paper we analyze the peak of the currently infected and the downhill of the propagation of the sars-cov-2 to do this we define a new model similar to a sird see for example 7 but without the population of supsceptibles because there are no criteria on defining the susceptible ones we consider three couple differential equations for infected it deaths dt and recovery rt with the following conservation law1ptitrtdtwhere pt represents the currently infected or positivein the last part of this article we observe as the following ratio infected iti over swabs sti2inormtiitistiis the most important parameter to describe the evolution of the sars-cov-2 indeed we can describe the trend of this quantity only with a generalized logistic model with 4 parameters even with data after april 7 this behavior suggest us to use this model for a future epidemic of this virus if we will able to perform a greater and constant number of swabs everyday using this model we may have better control over the contagion curve and consequently over the number of deathsour idea is to use a model that adapts to the data of the problem we explain better lets consider the following data1 daily data of march 14 3497 new infected 11682 swabs2 daily data of april 17 3493 new infected 65705 swabs3 probable case fatality rate cfr of the virus is rougly 1   23 million of infected at april 17 with 172434 detected4 time delay between hospitalization and death td  4 days parameter extrapolated also in 15 time delay between the onset of symptoms and healing tr1442 days a very oscillating parameter6 two different lockdown ld data march 10 and march 22 with different restriction
some comments about these data the points 1 and 2 describe perfectly that the sample of infected is not clean at the beginning of the contagion the swabs are performed only on the severe infected after 1 month the number of swabs are increased of a factor 6 and consequently also the midly infected are detected point 3 tells us that there is probably an incredible number of asymptomatics as a source of severe infected we have no control about it points 4 5 indicate that while the death data is under control the healed data are very oscillating in time finally the points 6 tells us that contribution of asymptomatics portrayed in 1 changes in time indeed from april 6-7 14-15 days after the second ld ie an incubation time the generalized logistic description failsafter these considerations we have decided to couple the following equations3didtr0iattt0

 kf is a proportionality constant between deaths and total number of infected while td and tr are the delays of deaths and recoveries respect to infected respectively the constant a represents the contribution of asymptomatic people as introduced in 1 and finally t
0 is the time of ld starta brief consideration about the function ft the great variability of tr suggest us that only the parameter tr is not sufficient to describe correctly the function rt so we decided to introduce a coefficient time dependentwe present two different scenarios in fig 1
we consider a linear approximation ftabt while in fig 2
we consider a quadratic approximation ftabtct2 this choice is not random indeed considering the behaviour of the recovery time series in which a single recovery can heal with some delay in a window variable from few days to two months the correct modeling could be a regressive linear function of type rti1naiitti eventually introducing also no-linear term in the series but in this way we introduce many degree of freedom how many are the coefficient ai of the regressive function therefore we consider an approximation using the two functions ft considered abovewe desumed the following values for the principal parameters by means of 100 stochastic simulation using direct method gillespie algorithm adapted to non-autonomous differential equations8r0029002

some comments about these values with respect to 1 we observe that the peak of the severe infected is correctly estimated ie t02426 march and also the peak of the deaths ie t02830 march also the time delay td remained the same the same tr approaches the experimental lower limit in quadratic approximation with respect to the logistic model r
0 is increased while the coefficient  drops from the value 2 to the value 184 ie we are considering different modelsin fig 1-2 we observe as the peak of currently infected is close to april 20 and finally we give us our prevision for a linear growth for the recoveries16iend247471dend35235close to july 10 for a quadratic growth we have17iend243766dend34682close to june 20the estimated numbers iend and dend are very close but it is not surprising the eqs 3 and 4 for total infected head the model while ft is present in eq 6 that is only a proportionality equation obviously a linear approximation for ft leads to a slower recovery curve and therefore a small increase of infectedwe consider also the scenario represented by eq 19 for germany in fig 3 and for usa in fig 8

a brief comment about these parameters the values r
0 are similar to each other and lower than the italian value with and without lombardia data this is completely coherent with the various scenarios the apparent lethality apparent cfr is approximately 45 in germany and 6 in the united states while in italy is 14 the contribution of asymptomatic a seems to be similar for all countrieshowever the surprising result is that the trend of the virus is captured by the same differential equation ie eq 19 for all considered countries this could mean that the virus always has the same type of behavior but at different speed lets try to justify this idea a different speed may depend on population density work habits and the number of swabs at the beginning of the epidemic about the last consideration we imagine to immediately carry out a large number of swabs knowing as soon as possible the largest possible number of infected means limiting the contagion and therefore the propagation speed of viruswe described the evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy in the time window february 24-may 5 to do this we have built a phenomenological growth model adapted on the data of civil protection with respect to a classical sird model we did not consider the supsceptible population because there are not medical evidences on which sample of the population can be ill so we have considered three couple differential equations for infected it deaths dt and recovery rt with the a conservation law including the currently positive population ptas the time delay between the onset of symptoms and healing tr days is a very oscillating parameter we introduced a sort of regressive function ft to modelling better this delay so we described two scenarios of the end of epidemic

obviously a linear approximation for ft leads to a slower recovery curve and therefore a small increase of infectedin the second part of this manuscript we described the time evolution of the normalized data45inormtiitistithat represents the number of infected normalized with the number of swabs stiwe have studied this parameter on four different scenariositalydata of italy minus data of lombardia about 37 of the italian infected belong to the lombardia regionusagermany
so we have found that all the evolutions are governed by the same generalized logistic equation 1 suggesting an universal feature of the propagation of sars-cov-2 virus in particular the value of the parameter r
0 is in descending order compatible with the respective apparent cfr acfrfor italy r00175 and acfr14
for italy-lombardia r00143 and acfr11
for usa r00082 and acfr6
germany r00069 and acfr45
finally we suggest that the data i
normti is the most important parameter to control the propagation of the virus for a new inauspicious propagation of this virus in the world because knowing its universal feature we can forward know the number of infected preparing a relevant number of swabs

the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papera newly identified coronavirus sars-cov-2 in china in december 2019 resulted in a significant number of pneumonia resulting in deaths the spread as usual of these viruses is rapidly spreading all over the world with thousands of thousands of deaths it is no coincidence that the who has declared a state of pandemic for these reasons worldwide attention is concentrated in the fight against this virus the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 is 795 of the identity with sars-cov the evidence that caused cov2 sars infection causes a generalized hyperinflammatory state due to the release of cytokines cytokine storm in literature it has been shown that the final stage of infection is the deadly one for humans in fact it is not the viral phase that kills but the strong activation of the immune system and the consequent release of cytokines the patient is thus supported and hospitalized in an intensive care unit icu hoping that he will overcome the famous storm and remain alive world scientific societies health professionals doctors researchers and scholars are intensifying research to find a suitable cure to fight the virus both to prevent infection and to treat the patient before he arrives at death the development of a vaccine will not be achieved in the short term many drugs are currently being tested to eradicate or at least reduce the lethality of the virus combinations of anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs appear to have shown good efficacy in inhibiting the release of cytokines thus preventing consequent lung collapse and also resulting in a drastic reduction in sars-cov-2-related mortality the spontaneous reflection is the possibility of resorting to clinical nutrition and amino acid supplementation both to prevent support and overcome the infectious phase with greater ease also in combination with pharmacological treatments this idea is reinforced by the fact that clinical nutrition and amino acids in addition to adequately nourishing the patient bedridden in icu can modulate the immune system to prevent infection and ensure that the inflammatory state is kept under control with less release of cytokines above all amino acids seem fundamental as an additional contribution in the patient suffering from covid and hospitalized in icu on the one hand it mitigates the release of cytokines and on the other it favors a prompt de-hospitalization in the healing phase for a prompt turn-over in the pandemic phase and with consequent savings of indirect and intangible costs 1 2covid-19 disease leads to serious respiratory consequences such as pneumonia respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sepsis and septic shock which in many cases leads to urgent hospitalization in intensive care ards is a severe hypoxic respiratory failure edema and risk of multi-organ dysfunction with invasive mechanical ventilation generally patients who have died from sars-cov-2 infection are older and have 3 or more comorbidities this is why covid-19 is the new -coronavirus which can lead to various pulmonary phenomena and death and represents a global health challenge medical nutrition therapy is among the pillars of therapeutic principles and a fundamental tool among global therapeutic measures for patients with covid-19 malnourished people with low immunity and chronic diseases have a worse higher prognosis and mortality rates the relevance of nutritional therapy is important and should be implemented as a first-line treatment and implemented in the anti-covid-19 clinical practice standard good nutrition not only provides the body with immunity to disease including covid-19 but it is also the main guarantee for the promotion of the recovery of the disease and the infected patient however the indications for nutritional therapy must be tailored nutritionists should pay attention to the most appropriate artificial nutrition an approach with enteral nutrition en or parenteral nutrition pn plan the method route and formula of nutritional therapy must be adapted dynamically and promptly in accordance with the clinical characteristics of the covid-19 patient the transition between ons en and pn should be fluid following the principle that when the en can satisfy 50 of the target demand the pn can be constantly reduced and carried out arrested when the ons can satisfy 50 of the target demand the en can be progressively reduced and therefore arrested 3 4 fig 1old age and chronic diseases are related to frailty a situation that leads to reduced functional reserves and reduced resistance to stress thus there is weight loss malnutrition and acute hospitalization if you do not intervene with adequate nutritional support it can make an already compromised situation worse all patients hospitalized for more than 48 h regardless of the initial body mass index bmi and age are at risk of malnutrition and need adequate and timely nutrition prolonged hospitalization following catabolism and immobilization induces a reduction in weight and muscle mass which can cause sarcopenia a condition which in turn helps to reduce respiratory and cardiac function prolong the patients hospitalization and a worse prognosis in order to prevent malnutrition the actions done by the hospital are improving the patients response to therapy and facilitating healthcare professionals in the hospital nutrition management by reducing the already high workload due to the state of emergency most patients have severe inflammation and anorexia which leads to one drastic reduction of food intake which then leads to a respiratory failure treated with continuous positive airway pressure high-calorie diets must be readily provided oral integration of whey protein and intravenous infusion of multivitamin and multimineral solutions must be implemented at the time of admission if respiratory conditions worsen total parenteral nutrition should be considered to cope with the current emergency crisis nutritional assistance must be implemented promptly and pragmatically in patients with covid-19 because it could be neglected although it is necessary for the benefit of clinical and effective results in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population 5 6 fig 2it is possible to follow simple patterns of conduct in the critical patient in the intensive care with respiratory failure for over 48 h en medical nutritional therapy must be started with priority pn nutrition has been started for more than 3 days after en strategies have failed to avoid severe malnutrition overeating should always be avoided and a gradual approach is best the nutritional requirement in covid-19 must provide more energy than normal nutrition maintaining the energy balance of patients with covid-19 is fundamental however considering the increased metabolic load in patients with severe pneumonia moderately low calories can reduce the metabolic load and excessive energy intake is a risk factor to reduce the catabolism due to inflammatory mediators it is indicated to increase protein intake as a top priority the supply of amino acids helps prevent muscle loss and improve the strength of the respiratory muscles given the importance of clinical ethical and economic action aimed at reducing infections including those from covid-19 studies have always been carried out which demonstrate how the correct supply of nutrients can improve the prognosis and pathological course in icus the use of amino acids undoubtedly improves the clinical course and favors the prompt physiological recovery after a period of hospitalization then in the case of the covid patient admitted to icu with a strong inflammatory state it is shown how the adequate nutritional support of glutamine probiotics and lactoferrin helps to reduce the pro-inflammatory molecules il-1 il-6 responsible for the fatal event pulmonary coronavirus alterations in muscle protein turnover if the patient remains hospitalized for a long time could lead to physical disability hypercatabolic activity if integrated with amino acids could limit muscle hypercatabatabism mh 7 8inflammation and changes in amino acid metabolism are related to covid-19 and affect the skeletal muscles therefore probably rehabilitation requires personalized approaches in addition amino acids are essential nutrients for infectious microorganisms and the levels of some amino acids such as tryptophan decrease in response to infection andor inflammation and for this reason they should be restored so as not to experience severe malnutrition some nutrients including amino acids have been shown to have a remarkable amount of influence on immune function immunonutrients and improvement of metabolic and nutritional indices such as nitrogen balance and serum proteins immunonutrients can promote patient recovery by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating immune function glutamine which can modulate and preserve intestinal and lung function is compromised in conditions of severe stress reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 9 10 cytokine-mediated effects are an essential part response to infection but excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines increases the risk of pneumonia and death in covid-19 patients the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines th1 cytokines eg tumor necrosis factor- tnf- il-1 il-6 interferon- ifn- in coronavirus pneumonia is overexpressed in a storm chronic inflammation occurs when the triggering factors persist or there is some sort of resolution failure processes inflammation plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines leading to the cytokine storm is currently considered to contribute to the development and progression of covid-19 many authors have shown that amino acids have anti-inflammatory effects and the integration of arginine glutamine or glycine improves lung damage induced by infections or any other inflammatory event thus contributing to alveolar improvement in its integrity and function in particular the administration of glutamine has been shown to significantly reduce inflammatory cytokines without affecting other parameters 11 12 arginine or glycine supplementation may be a new nutritional strategy to reduce the deleterious effects of bacterial infection on alveolar function proinflammatory cytokines tnf il-1 and il-6 and chemotactic cytokines cxcl-1 mcp-1 and icam-1 induce apoptosis in the alveoli and cause a severe inflammatory state the use of amino acids reduced the mrna levels for tnf il-1 and il-6 and reduced inflammation il-6 regulates the accumulation of neutrophils and therefore contributes to lung damage the administration of arginine or glycine leads to a reduction in the expression of il-6 and cxcl-1 with less neutrophils in the alveolar epithelium so as to have a regulatory effect on the lung arginine or glycine has a regulatory function as adjuvant nutrients in clinical therapy the molecular mechanisms underlying this important modulating effect of arginine glycine and glutamine are still to be clarified glutamine inhibits the accumulation of immune cells and arginine glycine or glutamine have inhibited cell apoptosis in various studies but the metabolism of amino acids and their metabolites differ from each other in the alveoli thus leading to different responses furthermore it should be added that malnutrition easily leads to a decrease in the lean body mass and can cause sarcopenia a frequently encountered disease in the elderly with aggravation of geriatric pathologies current opinions consider malnutrition and possible sarcopenia as a consequence of multiple medical behavioral and environmental factors involving the nervous hormonal nutritional system substitution of muscle proteins proinflammatory conditions and the load of reactive oxygen species inside the mitochondria with the intake of amino acids there is a better functional recovery of the muscles and a significant reduction in serum cancer necrosis factor tnf and a significant increase in both insulin-like growth factors without having significant adverse effects these preliminary data indicate that dietary supplements with the oral amino acid mixture have significantly increased lean body mass in elderly subjects with and without sarcopenia 13 14the suggestions for proper evidence-based nutritional therapy reported here are for patients with critical covid-19 conditions and should be included in life-saving therapies the supplementation of amino acids and lactoferrin should always be accompanied by drug therapies following an icu hospitalization and its importance cannot be overlooked malnutrition phenomena weaken the patient already in poor condition and greatly lengthen recovery and recovery times furthermore the lung damage caused by coronavirus is caused by an overexpression of proinflammatory molecules cytokines which from literature data has been shown to be lowered by an adequate integration of amino acids nutritional therapy together with pharmacological therapy undoubtedly helps the covid patient to overcome the acute phase of the disease first and to shorten recovery timesthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a pandemic infectious disease threatening the world in daegu korea the outbreak started on february 18 2020 and peaked on february 29 2020 with 741 new cases confirmed in a day1 in korea the method used for the diagnosis of all cases of covid-19 was real-time polymerase chain reactionwith an explosive increase in the number of new patients hospital bed shortage was a great challenge to the healthcare system1 we developed and employed a remote telephone severity scoring system daegu severity score for covid-19 for assigning priority for hospitalization and arranging for facility isolation therapeutic living centers starting on february 29 20201 fifteen centers were operated for the 3033 admissions to covid-19 therapeutic living centers1 approximately 150 physicians of the daegu medical association dma voluntarily participated in this study and checked the status of patients who were staying at home on a daily basis1 they reported the interview results to the team arranging hospitalization or facility isolation in daegu during the interviews several dma physicians found that a significant number of the patients stated experiencing acute loss of smell anosmia or loss of taste ageusia acute smell and taste disorders are related to a wide range of respiratory viral infections23covid-19 is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations4 in a typical case a high fever appears after dry cough in some cases viral pneumonia develops and progresses resulting in shortness of breath45 common symptoms among patients with covid-19 include fever dry cough shortness of breath dyspnea muscle ache myalgia confusion headache sore throat rhinorrhea chest pain diarrhea nauseavomiting conjunctival congestion nasal congestion sputum production fatigue malaise hemoptysis and chills46789 a literature review revealed a few published articles on the importance of anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of covid-1910111213from march 8 2020 dma physicians prospectively questioned patients newly diagnosed with covid-19 who were awaiting hospitalization or facility isolation regarding the presence of anosmia or ageusia they also provided counseling on a daily basis for these symptoms until admission to hospitals or therapeutic living centersthe data collected on anosmia or ageusia during the telephone severity scoring performed from march 8 2020 to march 31 2020 were analyzed retrospectively for the evaluation of the diagnostic significance of anosmia or ageusia in covid-19 additional telephone calls were made after admission to assess the duration of symptom persistence among those who reported that anosmia or ageusia persisted until hospitalization or facility isolationwe analyzed the collected data using descriptive statistics and kaplan-meier analysis for the evaluation of factors associated with the recovery from anosmia or ageusia statistical analyses were performed using r statistics version 35approximately 15 153 4883191 patients had anosmia or ageusia in the early stage of covid-19 fig 1 among patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity 2342 patients 367 157 had anosmia or ageusia the basic characteristics of the patients with or without anosmia or ageusia are summarized in table 1 anosmia or ageusia was significantly more common among females and younger individuals p  001 and p  0001 respectively table 1the duration of these two symptoms was ascertained based on the daily interviews conducted by dma physicians during the waiting period for hospitalization or facility isolation and by follow-up telephone interviews with 232 for anosmia and 196 for ageusia patientsrecovery from anosmia is expressed using a survival curve fig 2a kaplan-meier graphs with log-rank tests were generated using data on recovery from anomia based on demographic variables including age of  50 years and sex no significant differences were observed in log-rank teststhe median time to recovery from anosmia was 7 days and the recovery time pattern is depicted in fig 2b the median time to recovery from ageusia was 7 days and the recovery time pattern is shown in fig 2c most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks fig 2b and c young age particularly the age group of 2039 years showed a tendency to be associated with a longer persistence of anosmia fig 2d recovery from ageusia was similar to that from anomia supplementary fig 1 recently anosmia was reported in a small cross-sectional survey study of covid-1911 this article did not report follow-up information and included a relatively small number of patients 59 patients our data were derived from 3191 patients among whom 232 anosmia and 143 ageusia were followed up regarding the persistence of these symptomssmell and taste disorders are related to a wide range of viral infections23 infection of the upper respiratory tract can cause acute-onset anosmia or ageusia because of viral damage to the olfactory epithelium3 moreover viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a route into the central nervous system include influenza a virus herpesviruses poliovirus rabies virus parainfluenza virus adenoviruses and japanese encephalitis virus2 in mouse models sars-cov demonstrated transneuronal penetration through the olfactory bulb and its infection resulted in the rapid transneuronal spread of the virus to connected areas of the brain14 in covid-19 headache may not only be a constitutional symptom but also be a symptom induced by invasion of the central nervous system human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-21012damage to the olfactory nerve during invasion and multiplication of sars-cov-2 may explain anosmia observed in the early stage of covid-19 therefore anosmia or ageusia may be more frequently observed in the covid-19 patients than other respiratory viral infectionsageusia may be a secondary result of olfactory dysfunction however the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor which is the main host cell receptor of sars-cov-2 for binding and penetrating cells is widely expressed on epithelial cells of the oral mucosa15 damage of mucosal epithelial cells of the oral cavity may explain ageusia observed in the early stage of covid-19 this evidence may explain the pathogenetic mechanism underlying anosmia and ageusia in covid-19high transmissibility of covid-19 before and immediately after symptom onset was reported with a recent epidemic study16 early diagnosis is important for the control of covid-19 recognition of early signs such as anosmia or ageusia might be very helpful for the diagnosis covid-19 and isolation of the patientsthis telephone severity scoring system had a limitation regarding the accuracy of the assessment of patients however anosmia and ageusia are not ambiguous symptoms our report had a relatively large number of patients and focused on the time pattern on the recovery of these symptomsin conclusion anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of covid-19 particularly in the early stage of the disease the acute anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized as important symptoms of the covid-19 infectionamong patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity the presence of anosmia or ageusia may be an important differential presentation for the suspicion and diagnosis of covid-19 and these symptoms may recover within 3 weekscovid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread in many countries13 as of april 6 2020 sars-cov-2 has affected over 1200000 people and killed more than 60000 of those affected in more than 160 countries following its global spread the world health organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern4 covid-19 shows symptoms of fever dry cough fatigue diarrhea conjunctivitis and pneumonia some patients develop severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or multiple organ failure57 although scientists and clinicians worldwide have made great efforts to produce vaccines and explored antiviral drugs89 there is still no specific medicine and highly effective clinical treatment for covid-191011immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm have been observed and are believed to be associated with the severity of pathogenic coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections1213 with regard to covid-19 recent studies also found decreases in lymphocyte numbers and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood514 however the manner in which key immune cell subsets change and their states during covid-19 have remained largely unclear thus defining these key cellular subsets and their states in covid-19 is a crucial step in obtaining critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism and developing new therapeutic strategies for covid-19here we applied single-cell rna sequencing scrna-seq to comprehensively characterize the changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from 10 covid-19 patients our study depicted a high-resolution transcriptome landscape of blood immune cell subsets during the recovery stage of covid-19 it revealed that compared to that in the healthy controls hcs monocytes containing high inflammatory gene expression and il1 subsets predominated whereas cd4 t cells decreased remarkably in patients in the early recovery stage of covid-19 we found that t and b cell clones were highly expanded during the recovery stage in covid-19 patients furthermore several specific bcr changes in covid-19 patients during the recovery stage may be helpful for vaccine and antibody productionto map the immune microenvironment of covid-19 patients we identified mirroring changes in the blood and pinpointed cell-specific alterations associated with disease severity and recovery we then integrated scrna-seq single-cell paired bcr and single-cell paired tcr analysis from a total of 10 covid-19 patients in the early recovery stage ers or late recovery stage lrs 70858 pbmcs we also collected scrna-seq data 57238 cells from five healthy donors as controls fig 1a and supplementary fig s1ac this dataset passed stringent high-quality filtering single-cell suspensions of the scrna-seq samples were converted to barcoded scrna-seq libraries using 10x genomics cell ranger software version 310 was used for the initial processing of the sequencing datausing t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t-sne we analyzed the distribution of the three immune cell lineages myeloid nk and t and b cells based on the expression of canonical lineage markers and other genes specifically upregulated in each cluster fig 1b c for marker genes expression values in each cell positioned in a t-sne are shown in fig 1d we next clustered the cells of each lineage separately and identified a total of 20 immune cell clustersthe immune cell compartment of patients who have recovered from covid-19 infection comprised all major immune lineages we analyzed 128096 scrna-seq profiles that passed quality control including 36442 myeloid cells 64247 nk and t cells and 10177 b cells from five hcs five ers and five lrs patients the sketchy clustering analysis landscape of each subject is presented in supplementary fig s2a and the merged image of each group is shown in fig 2a we discovered that covid-19 patients including ers and lrs demonstrated a higher proportion of myeloid cells compared to the hcs but with a lower proportion of nk and t cells fig 2b c interestingly lrs patients had more b cells and nk and t cells but less myeloid cells than the ers patients fig 2b c thus these findings indicated that covid-19 patients had decreased lymphocyte counts and increased counts of myeloid cells in peripheral bloodto further understand the changes in the myeloid nk and t and b cells in covid-19 patients we conducted differential expression gene deg analysis of the nk and t b and myeloid cells between the hcs and patients the heatmaps are shown in fig 2df inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il1b ccl3 irf1 dusp1 jun and fos were all expressed at high levels in patients regardless of myeloid cells fig 2d nk and t cells fig 2e or b cells fig 2fcollectively our results demonstrated that myeloid cells increased whereas nk and t cells decreased in the peripheral blood of covid-19 patients and that the immune cell compositions differed between the patients in the ers and lrsto further understand the changes in the monocytes in patients in the early and late recovery stages of covid-19 we conducted gene expression analysis and sub-clustered the myeloid cells into six transcriptionally distinct subsets using uniform manifold approximation and projection umap classical cd14 monocytes m1 non-classical cd16 fcgr3a cd14 monocytes m2 intermediate cd14 cd16 monocytes m3 cd1c cdc2 m4 clec9a cdc1 m5 and pdc clec4ccd123 m6 were present in the six distinct clusters fig 3a b we found that the compartment of the monocyte subset differed remarkably among the hcs and covid-19 patients fig 3c among the myeloid cells the ratio of classical cd14 monocytes m1 higher in the ers patients than in the hcs and was almost normal in the lrs patients fig 3cwe found that covid-19 patients had a greater abundance of cd14 il1 monocytes and ifn-activated monocytes than the hcs fig 3df genes associated with cd14 inflammatory monocytes m1 had high expression levels of inflammatory genes such as il1 jun fos junb and klf6 chemokines ccl4 cxcr4 and interferon-stimulated genes ifrd1 irf1 and ifi6 in contrast anti-inflammatory genes associated with cd14 monocytes m1 were downregulated in covid-19 patients relative to that in the hcs fig 3d e notably il1 expression values in a umap with simultaneous contrast indicated that il1 was upregulated in the ers group and decreased in the lrs patients fig 3f this was also confirmed in the dc cluster of the ers group compared to that of the hcs supplementary fig s3a b next we took the average of the inflammatory genes for each myeloid cell scrna-seq subset in the covid-19 patients versus that in the hcs supplementary fig s3c these results demonstrated that cytokine activation drives the expansion of monocyte populations especially cd14 inflammatory monocytes in covid-19-infected patients to explore the biological significance of the transcriptional changes in the m1 cluster we performed go analysis with degs fig 3g we observed enrichment of the pathways related to cytokine signaling and inflammation activation which were driven by the upregulation of ifitm3 and ifi6 and il1 jun fos junb and klf6 fig 3gcollectively these findings demonstrate that a dysregulated balance in the monocyte populations in ers patients is manifested by substantially increased classical cd14 monocytes our results suggest that the classical cd14 monocytes increase in circulation to fuel inflammation during sars-cov-2-infectiont and nk cells play critical roles in viral clearance during respiratory infections1516 our clustering analysis sub-grouped t and nk lymphocytes into 10 subsets fig 4a based on canonical markers fig 4b and supplementary fig s4a nk cells highly expressed ncam1 klrf1 klrc1 and klrd1 then we sub-divided the nk cells into cd56cd16 nk cells nk1 which expressed high levels of cd56 and low levels of cd16 and c56cd16 nk cells nk2 which expressed high levels of cd16 and low levels of cd56 cd4 t cells expressed cd3e and cd4 then we sub-divided these cells into four clusters nave cd4 t cells t1 which expressed high levels of ccr7 lef1 and tcf7 central memory cd4 t cells t2 cd4 tcm which expressed high levels of ccr7 but more aqp3 and cd69 compared to nave cd4 t cells effector memory cd4 t cells t3 cd4 tem which expressed high levels of ccr6 cxcr6 ccl5 and prdm1 and regulatory t cells t4 treg which expressed foxp3 cd8 t cells expressed cd8a and cd8b and were sub-divided into three clusters nave cd8 t cells t5 which expressed high levels of ccr7 lef1 and tcf7 similar to nave cd4 t cells effector memory cd8t cells t6 cd8 tm which expressed high levels of gzmk and cytotoxic cd8 lymphocytes cd8 ctl t7 which expressed high levels of gzmb gnly and prf1 proliferating t cells t8 tprol were tyms
mki67 cellsthe composition of the t and nk cell subsets differed significantly among the hcs and covid-19 patients fig 4c the absolute number of cd8t cells especially the effector memory cd8 t cell subgroup and nk cells decreased in covid-19 patients whereas the relative ratio of nk cells in ers was higher than that in the hcs the ratio of cd4 t cells was stable but the composition of the cd4 t cell subset differed significantly between the hcs and covid-19 patients among cd4 t cells the ratio of central memory cd4 t cells was significantly higher whereas the ratio of nave cd4 t cells tregs and effector memory cd4 t cell was lower than that in the hcs especially in ers group notably genes associated with cd4 t cells had relatively high expression levels of inflammation-related genes and were significantly upregulated in the covid-19 patients fig 4d cd4 t cells had high expression levels of inflammatory genes including fos jun klf6 and s100a8 in patients in the ers of covid-19 fig 4e in contrast anti-inflammatory genes associated with cd4 t cells were downregulated in covid-19 patients relative to that in the hcs fig 4d e this suggested that cd4 t cells were the main participants in the virus infection comparison of the degs in the cd4 t cells revealed the enrichment of genes participating in the cytokine pathway and inflammation activation including ifitm3 and ifi6 and il1b jun fos junb and klf6 fig 4f further studies are needed to elucidate the ifn pathways involved in covid-19 pathogenesistcr-seq analysis showed that t cell expansion was obviously decreased in the ers group than in the hc group fig 4g moreover nave or central memory t cells showed little clonal expansion while effector memory t cells terminal effector cd8 t cells ctls and proliferating t cells showed higher expansion levels fig 4h in addition the most highly expanded maximum clone in the ers group was trav8-6-traj45trav7-8-trbj2-1 supplementary fig s5d the decreased ratio of cd8 t cells in covid-19 patients may implicate the role of cd8 t cells in virus clearance fig 4c moreover the cd8 ctl with expanded clones also exhibited overactivated inflammation and antiviral activity compared to those in hcs fig 4i and supplementary fig s4b together these findings show that clonally expanded cd8 t cells in the peripheral blood of covid-19 patients help control the virus we also performed deg analysis via seurat findallmarkers analysis and found similar results in tprol cells supplementary fig s4c next we took the average of inflammatory genes for each nk and t cell subset scrna-seq subset in the covid-19 patients versus normal rna-seq data supplementary fig s4dby projecting the gene expression data of b cells using diffusion maps we identified four b cell clusters using scrna-seq nave b cells b1 expressing cd19 cd20 ms4a1 ighd ighm il4r and tcl1a memory b cells b2 expressing cd27 cd38 and ighg immature b cells b3 only expressing cd19 and cd20 ms4a1 and plasma cells b4 expressing high levels of xbp1 and mzb1 fig 5a b and supplementary fig s5ain comparison with that in the hcs the percentage of plasma cells increased significantly in covid-19 patients whereas nave b cells decreased significantly in the covid-19 patients fig 5c memory b cells and plasma cells mpb might play an important role in the control of viral infection and the development of adoptive immunity as they synergistically work and induce specific antibodies moreover compared to that in the hcs b cell activation-related genes including s100a8 igll5 ssr3 igha1 xbp1 and mzb1 were primarily expressed in the mpb of the ers group fig 5d we also found similar results in the plasma cells the antibody-secreting cells asc supplementary fig s5b c suggesting a key role for asc in viral control next we took the average of the inflammatory genes for each b cell subset of the covid-19 patients versus the normal rna-seq data fig 5e the difference in the genes between the ers and hcs indicated enhanced b cell reaction and antibody secretion in covid-19 patients go analysis revealed that igha1 xbp1 mzb1 jun polr2l and zfp36 were overpresented in mpbs which suggests enhanced b cell proliferation and viral transcription in covid-19 patients fig 5f single-cell bcr-seq analysis indicated that the iga isotype was over-represented in covid-19 patients compared to that in the hc fig 5g this corresponded with an increase in the levels of serum iga which was also pronounced in other coronavirus infections moreover the ratio of igaiggige to igdigm increased significantly in the ers patients and showed a downward trend with recovery time fig 5husing sc-bcr-seq to assess the status of clonal expansions in the blood of patients we found that il4r nave b cells showed little clonal expansion whereas cd27cd38 memory b cells showed the highest expansion levels among diverse b cell subsets fig 6a at the individual level we found that covid-19 patients had significantly expanded clones compared to that in the hcs supporting the assumption that b cells had experienced unique clonal vdj rearrangements under sars-cov-2-infection we also found that a higher b cell clonality consistently remained in the ers compared with that in the lrs patients fig 6b moreover quantification of the most highly expanded maximum clone for each subject showed that the ratios of the maximum clones were higher in the ers group than in the hcs fig 6c to understand the functional status of expanded cloned b cells we performed deg analysis between the cloned memory b cells and the other b cells our results revealed increased expression of b cell genes including cd27 ssr4 ighg1 mzb1 and xbp1 which further supports the superior effector functions of the expanded cloned b cells fig 6d moreover the differential genes for expanded b cells significantly subsided over time and reduced in lrs patients fig 6dto study the unique changes and preference genes of bcr in covid-19 patients we compared the usage of vdj genes in covid-19 patients with that in the hcs we identified an over-representation of the ighv3 family especially the ighv3-7 ighv3-15 ighv3-21 ighv3-23 and ighv3-30 in covid-19 patients compared to that in the hcs fig 6e the preferred igkvs were igkv1-17 igkv2-28 and igkv3-15 whereas the preferred iglvs were iglv1-44 iglv2-8 and iglv3-27 fig 6e moreover the top two pairing frequencies in ers patients were ighv3-23-ighj4 and ighv3-7- ighj6 fig 6f these cells showed igh subunit pairing with the igkl subunit encoded by iglv1-44-iglj3 and igkv1-17-igkj1 respectively which indicated expanded states associated with sars-cov-2 specificity individually ers-4 and ers-5 had the maximum clones referring to ighv3-23-ighj4 supplementary fig s5e and ighv3-7- ighj6 supplementary fig s5f respectivelyin summary an increase in clonality in covid-19 which was dominated by the iga and igm isotypes together with a skewed use of the ighv gene suggested the contribution of sars-cov-2 to pathogenesis notably the biased usage of dominated igv genes especially the ighv3-23 and ighv3-7 in covid-19 patients provides a framework for the rational design of sars-cov-2 vaccinesan established computational approach17 was used to predict cell-to-cell interactions that may contribute to the distinct functional state of t cells b cells monocytes and dendritic cells dcs in ers and lrs fig 7a b in ers covid-19 patients we found adaptive signals involved in monocyte activation proliferation and inflammatory signaling fig 7a b t cells expressed genes encoding ligands of tnfsf8 lta ifng il17a ccr5 and ltb to tnfrsf8 tnfrsf1atnfrsf14 ifngr1 il-17ra ccr1 and ltbr which were expressed on monocytes and could contribute to the pro-inflammatory status other t cell-monocyte interactions involved the expression of csf2 and csf1 t cells might activate monocytes through the expression of csf2 and csf1 which bind to csfrs csfr21 and contribute to inflammatory storm a cluster of cd14 monocytes exclusively expressed il1 which was predicted to bind to il1rap expressed by t cells t cell-monocyte interaction may enhance immune response and be exclusive to covid-19 patients fig 7a b furthermore we found that monocytes highly expressed the poliovirus receptor which serves as a cellular receptor for poliovirus in the first step of poliovirus replication and induction of the nf-kappa b signaling pathway from the b cell-monocyte and b cell-t cell interactions we found that b cells could secrete a large number of il-6 lta and ltb which are combined with il-6r ltar and ltbr expressed in monocytes and a large amount of il-6 was applied to t cells to promote the secretion of ifn- il-1 and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines thus a cascade signature of inflammatory monocytes with high expression of il-6 and their progeny were formed in the peak incidence of ers covid-19 patients fig 7c these activated immune cells may enter the circulation in the lung and other organs in large numbers and play an immune-damaging role in lrs covid-19 patients dc ligands were predicted to interact with b and t cell receptors involved in cell proliferation and the production of antibodies we discovered that the peripheral blood of lrs patients contains a diversity of antibodies we found that il18-il18rap tnfsf13-tnfrsf13b tnfsf13-tnfrsf17 tnfsf13b-tnfrsf17 tnfsf13b-tnfrsf13b and tnfsf13b-tnfrsf13c were highly expressed in our analysis of dc-b cell interaction fig 7d thus we speculate that dcs produce il-18 tnfsf13 and tnfsf13b to promote the proliferation of b cells and then secrete many antibodies into the blood in ers from the dc-t and t cell-b cell interactions we discovered that dcs produce not only il-18 but also il-7 to promote the proliferation of t cells moreover t cells produce il-2 to promote the proliferation and antibodies production of b cells fig 7d thus cell-to-cell interactions help us to understand why covid-19 patients manifested high rates of monocytes and low rates of lymphocytes and why the proportion of lymphocytes gradually increased in the peripheral blood of recovering patientsthe clinical presentation of covid-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe ards this has been similarly observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and influenza infections1214 in viral infection it is generally accepted that host immune responses determine both protection against viral infections and the pathogenesis of respiratory injury1819 a coordinated response in innate and adaptive immune cells working in concert may lead to the rapid control of the virus whereas a failed immune response might lead to viral spreading cytokine storm and a high mortality rate20 despite belonging to same group of viruses recent studies have highlighted differences between covid-19 sars and mers such as the speed of transmission treatment scheme and mortality rate moreover this difference may also exist in the key immune players and the underlying molecular mechanisms related to these diseases the lack of knowledge regarding the immune impact of covid-19 has now become a critical issue in view of its rapid spread and the shortage of specific therapy21 using single-cell sequencing we profiled the complexity of immune populations in the blood and analyzed 70858 cells from 10 patients we identified a hyper-inflammatory response in ers patients which may explain why some patients fell sick after being discharged and suggest that the current criteria for hospital discharge should be re-evaluated in addition we identified unique signatures of myeloid nk and t and b cells and pinpointed the changes in the epitopes of tcr and bcr our findings helped elucidate the antiviral immune mechanisms and revealed promising opportunities for developing immunotherapies using vaccines and neutralizing antibodiesinflammation is a vital part of the immune systems response to covid-19 invasion previous and latest studies have reported significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines associated with disease severity in sars mers and covid-19 patients2223 among the various inflammatory cells monocytes and their subsets including classical intermediate and non-classical monocytes may play a critical role because they are known to fuel inflammation2427 in our study compared with the hcs ers patients demonstrated a significantly higher ratio of monocytes and these cells expressed higher levels of inflammatory genes intriguingly the ratio of classical cd14 monocytes was high in ers but remained normal in lrs furthermore cd14il1 monocytes which were absent in hcs could be observed in ers and they declined in number in lrs notably our cell-to-cell interaction analysis indicated that il1 csf1 il6 and csf2 may be associated with cytokine storm the cd14il1 subpopulation appeared to be part of the inflammatory landscape of covid-19 since these cells increased in ers stage virus-induced il-1 production in monocytes is mediated via a caspase-1 pathway multiple microbial components including viral rna are thought to trigger assembly of the inflammasome and consequent caspase-1 activation28 which may give a reasonable explanation for the presence of il1 monocytes in ers patients previous studies with a pathogenic influenza a virus revealed impaired neutrophil and cd4 t cell activation in il-1r1 mice greatly diminished lung inflammatory infiltrates reduced igm levels in both serum and at mucosal sites and decreased activation of cd4 t helpers in secondary lymphoid tissue29 indicating il1 is responsible for virus-induced lung immunopathology establishment cd14 il1 is also expected to become an important detection marker for monitoring covid-19 disease recovery collectively our data provide important insights into the role of monocytes in the immunopathogenesis of covid-19the adaptive immune system harbors the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens through antibody and t cell responses30 inducing adaptive immunity is the aim of vaccination31 previous sars studies have identified binding and neutralizing antibodies elicited by sars-cov infection their therapeutic effect is unclear32 although robust antibody responses could be induced33 in covid-19 infection although several lines of evidence have consistently indicated a decline in lymphocyte counts the distinct immune characteristics at single-cell resolution are unclear irani thevarajan et al34 reported that in the blood of mild-to-moderate covid-19 hospitalized patients the antibody-secreting cells follicular t-helper cells activated cd4 and cd8 t-cells and igmigg sars-cov-2-binding antibodies were increased by using flow cytometry and they found the changes persisted for at least 7 days following full resolution of symptoms our scrna-seq analysis showed that compared with the hcs ers patients who recovered less than 7 days have a lower ratio of t and nk cells and these patients t cells express higher levels of inflammatory genes such as jun fos junb and klf6 several studies have reported that lymphopenia is a prominent part of sars-cov2 infection and lymphocyte counts are useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes3537 we found the number of nk and t cell decreased but no significant change in b cell in covid-19 patients especially in ers patients possible reasons for it may be the direct infection of lymphocytes by sars-cov2 cytokine-mediated lymphocyte trafficking in the infected tissue or lymphocytes exhaustion in the peripheral blood and sequestration in the lung induced by cytokine storm35 there may also be immune-mediated lymphocyte destruction bone marrow or thymus suppression or apoptosis38 as is reported in other virus infection which requires further study in addition high-throughput tcr sequencing identified expanded t cell clones in ers patients in lrs patients the immunophenotype was different in particular lrs patients would have an increase in t and nk cells with a lower expression of inflammatory genes we also performed a detailed analysis of b cells in patients and identified a higher population of plasma cells than that in the hcs we found that bcr contained highly expanded clones indicating their sars-cov-2 specificity importantly we found several loci unique to covid-19 infection the strongest pairing frequencies ighv3-23-ighj4 indicated a monoclonal state associated with sars-cov-2 specificity which has not been reported yet notably numerous studies have reported biased usage of vdj genes related to virus-specific antibodies for example ighv3-30 and igkv3-11 have been involved in encoding primary antibodies to neutralize human cytomegalovirus3940 in addition ighv3-30 and ighv3-21 have been utilized to isolate influenza virus antibodies and used for the production of virus vaccines4142 moreover a recent study demonstrated that antibodies combining the ighv3-15iglv1-40 segments had superior neutralizing activities against the zaire ebola virus43 in addition we observed lower expression of inflammatory genes in ers patients than in the hcs we envision that our results will provide direction for the development of vaccines and antibodies for covid-19 patientsinteraction between immune cells may help expedite or defer recovery from covid-19 infection our cell-to-cell prediction analysis utilizing scrna-seq data indicated that in ers patients b cell-derived il-6 t cell-derived csf1 m-csf and csf2 gm-csf may promote monocyte proliferation and activation as a result monocytes may produce a larger number of inflammatory mediators including il-1 and il-6 contributing to inflammatory storm in lrs patients both dcs-derived tnfsf13 and il-18 and t cell-derived il-2 il-4 may promote b cell survival proliferation and differentiation consequently b cells produce numerous sars-cov-2-specific antibodies to clear viruses which is in agreement with the research of zhou y et al44 who reported cd4 t cells are activated into t-helper th 1 cells and generate gm-csf etc to induced inflammatory cd14cd16 monocytes with high expression of il-6 and accelerates the inflammation after 2019-ncov infectionthe immune system comprises a network of cells tissues and organs that mediate host defense against pathogens immune cells can be classified into distinct types based on specific surface markers with the aid of flow cytometry and microscopy however not all immune cell types can be completely addressed by a separate analysis of phenotypic markers as many markers are expressed by multiple cell lineages or are regulated differently during inflammation in recent years sequencing technology has been widely used in biological research on this base scrna-seq is used in immunological research to seek to address previously unrecognized cellular heterogeneity and to reveal key pathways in gene regulatory networks that predict immune function45 in the present study we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of covid-19 scrna-seq is a powerful tool to identify novel cell subsets during disease progression in our study cd14il1 subpopulation was mapped using this method which uncovered the originator cells in ers patients in conclusion our study provided the first immune atlas of patients who have recovered from covid-19 and identified adaptive immune dysregulation after discharge the clonal expansion of both t and b cells indicated that the immune system has gradually recovered however the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 7 days after discharge suggested the need for medical observation after patients are discharged from hospital longitudinal studies of recovered patients in a larger cohort might help to understand the consequences of the disease the novel bcrs identified in our study may advance our understanding of b cell mechanisms and have potential clinical utility in covid-19 immunotherapiesten covid-19 patients diagnosed with by real-time fluorescent rt-pcr were collected in the wuhan hankou hospital china patients were divided into early recovery stage ers group and late recovery stage lrs group according to the days from

outcomes were examined in 75 patients olfactory-specific quality of life can be measured using the questionnaire of olfactory disfunction which examines various aspects of olfactory dysfunctionpatients were invited to participate and informed consent was obtained the following exclusion criteria were considered patients with olfactory or gustatory dysfunction before the covid-19 epidemic patients with a history of rhinosinusitis or nasal polyposis and patients with a history of nasal surgery including those with or without functional endoscopic sinus surgery self-reported anosmia and dysgeusia in covid-19-positive patients were identified as common symptoms mild hyposmia 24 moderate hyposmia 13 severe hyposmia 30 anosmia 32 and dysgeusia 100 the most significant finding was olfactory and dysgeusia recovery within an average of 17 days all patients reported the onset of hyposmia anosmia and dysgeusia prior to admission table 1
and table 2
although the mechanism of olfactory and gustatory function loss remains unclear 5 these preliminary clinical findings may indicate that relatively rapid recovery of olfactory and gustative function can mean a resolution of viral infection in most patients and there was no distinction between hyposmia anosmia and dysgeusia contrary to what was found in other studies 6 the analysis of our sample revealed that covid-19 does not seem to cause permanent injury to olfactory and gustatory function because complete recovery occurs after two weeks self-reported olfactory and dysgeusia impairment has been recognized as a hallmark of covid-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome such alterations are mainly transient with a completepartial recovery within a few weeks although no clear evidence is available yet the present study suggests that coronavirus can induce a period of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction but in the studied population it does not cause permanent damagesources of support in the form of grantsnonedeclaration of competing intereststhe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papercompliance with ethical standardsthe ethics committee of brescia asst spedali civili of brescia approved the study protocol np 4138-12052020

coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 became a viral pandemic that emerged from east asia due to sars-cov-23 in brazil the number of cases continues to increase with more than 66000 confirmed cases by the end of april 20204 however it is estimated that the number is even higher as the number of diagnostic tests performed is still insufficient for the national demandin covid-19 the most common otorhinolaryngological symptoms are coughing sore throat and dyspnea rhinorrhea and nasal congestion have also been found however there are reports of odgd5 6 and that they are present even before molecular confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection6 7 these observations were made recently in countries that started to perform molecular tests for covid-19 more extensively in which patients infected with sars-cov-2 reported severe od and gd without rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction in the beginning covid-19 was not suspected in some of these patients as they did not have fever cough or any other classic general signssymptoms of covid-19 the od and gd in covid-19 still show gaps in their understanding of both the clinical spectrum and the treatment to be proposedthe advancement of knowledge on a specific topic can be facilitated through systematic reviews sr which make it possible to identify analyze and synthesize the best scientific evidence for best clinical practices especially in the face of new clinical scenarios such as the current covid-19 pandemic in that randomized controlled studies and precise recommendations for their management are not yet available the objective of this sr is to identify evidence of current knowledge on olfactory-gustatory disorders about the clinical presentation prevalence and possible specific treatments associated with covid-19the strategies aimed at a complete search including descriptors medical subject headings - mesh and free terms which consisted of covid-19 2019-ncov 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia sars-cov sars-cov-2 sars coronavirus coronavirus coronavirus infection coronavirus covid-19 novel coronavirus covid-19 clinical features olfactory disorders olfaction disorders and taste disorders to identify the relevant articles for the proposed question a search strategy was developed covid-19 or 2019-ncov or 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia or sars-cov or sars-cov-2 or sars coronavirus or coronavirus or coronavirus infection or coronavirus covid-19 or novel coronavirus and covid 19 clinical features or olfactory disorders or olfaction disorders or taste disorders this strategy was adapted to the databases and the corresponding terms were applied in portuguese and spanish at lilacs database there was no restriction on the language of publication the complete search strategy is shown in the supplementary material appendix 1between april 2 and 25 2020 the following electronic databases were searched medline via pubmed cochrane clinical trials sciencedirect lilacs scopus and google schoolar as well as the gray literature opengreyeu dissonline the new york academy of medicine and reasearch gate to prevent citation bias there was no manual search for the included articles and specialists in the field were not contacted9
after the search the references of each database were exported to the mendeley program httpswwwmendeleycom aiming to identify all articles in duplicate promote greater selection reliability and proceed to the eligibility criteria stepthe following inclusion criteria were considered 1 observational studies with individuals diagnosed with coronavirus infection and 2 recording of the signs and symptoms of covid-19 with clinical aspects related to olfactory andor gustatory function the following exclusion criteria were considered 1 studies on non-human coronavirus 2 review articles 3 experimental studies in animals or in vitro 4 clinical report of odgd with onset prior to the sars-cov-2 infectionthe search for the articles was carried out by two reviewers the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were independently assessed by two researchers who were not blinded to the authors or the titles of journals the full versions of the potentially eligible articles were retrieved for further evaluation and were carried out in three stages1identification and reading of titles in different electronic databases articles that clearly did not meet any of the inclusion or exclusion criteria were excluded2reading of the abstracts of the studies selected in the first phase likewise articles that clearly did not meet any of the inclusion or exclusion criteria were excluded3all studies that were not excluded in these first two stages were read in full for the selection of the ones that would be included in this systematic review sr
the main data for each article was fully collected and inserted into a database created in the microsoft office excel 2010 software there were no disagreements between the evaluators a standard form for data storage was created based on the model adopted by cochrane10 for a better presentation of the results it was decided to consider the following variables of the selected articles title author study location study design sample size n patients mean age and ethnicity both the diagnostic method and the most prevalent general signssymptoms and the severity of the clinical picture of covid-19 methods used in the olfactory-gustatory evaluation and the prevalence of od and gd the outcomes sought in the studies were both the demographic data prevalence and clinical expressions of odgd as well as possible specific treatments for such disorders in patients diagnosed with covid-19the risk of bias was assessed according to the recommendations in the manual and the newcastle-ottawa scale adapted for cross-sectional observational studies11 study quality was independently assessed by two researchers and the divergences were evaluated by consensus the maximum score to be achieved was 10 points and the items evaluated on the scale were 1 representativeness of the sample 2 sample size 3 characterization of the diagnosis 4 risk exposure assessment risk factor 5 comparability to investigate whether individuals in different groups of results are comparable based on the study design or analysis control of confounding factors 6 evaluation of results and 7 statistical test table 1

factor that can be used as a marker for milder manifestations of covid-19 thus the authors suggest that od may be a clinical marker to help stratify disease severity at the beginning of sars-cov-2

regarding specific treatments there was no evidence of specific drugs that were effective for the recovery of olfactorygustatory functions nasal lavage was predominant in the studied groupstherefore patients with covid-19 of different ethnicities were evaluated with high prevalence of impaired smelltaste with women being the most significantly affected gender unlike other viral etiologies sars-cov-2 can lead to loss of olfactorygustatory functions even without the presence of nasal obstructionrhinorrhea and with the onset of odgd even before the clinical signssymptoms of covid-19 there is evidence that odgd are strong predictors of infection by sars-cov-2 and it is possible to recommend the isolation of the patient as of the medical consultation and still without the result of the laboratory test to prevent the dissemination of the virus the recovery of smelltaste when it occurs usually does so within the first two weeks after the resolution of covid-19 no scientific evidence has been identified for effective treatments for any of the disordersthe studies have shown that both olfactory and gustatory disorders of varying intensities and in which onset occurred prior to the general symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection may occur and such disorders should be considered as part of the symptoms that may be present even in mild cases of covid-19 there is still no scientific evidence of specific treatments for such disorders in covid-19the authors declare no conflicts of interestviruses are an important class of microorganisms that can pose serious airborne hazards to clinical and non-clinical health care workers and workers handling animals potential threats to the general public include bioterrorism especially from the smallpox virus and emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and avian influenza thus virtually everyone is at the risk of exposure to contagious viruses via inhalationviruses differ from other microorganisms in that they can replicate only inside a host cell however they can survive in the environment and be transmitted through air in the absence of host cells gerone et al 1966 viruses are 20300 nm in size and they usually travel in air carried by other materials such as droplets of respiratory secretions or dust particles otten and burge 1999 epidemiological evidence suggests that the transmission of viral infections may occur inside and between neighboring buildings donaldson 1978 riley et al 1978 blood and tissue aerosols generated during general and dental surgery may also contribute to the transmission of these viruses reponen et al 2001testing the ability of heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac respiratory protection and other filters to capture biological aerosols is important to ensure that the filters perform as expected viruses are more difficult and expensive to use as a test aerosol for filters than other biological particles and considerable background knowledge and experience are required to handle them properly particles the size of single viruses will be captured primarily by brownian diffusion lee and liu 1982 however few studies have measured the collection efficiency of filters challenged by virus particles although bacteriophages eg ms2 have been used as a surrogate for human viruses in some studies foarde et al 1999 research triangle institute 2004 they cannot be expected to represent all types of human and animal viruses hence studies with these viruses are sorely neededin this study we used transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev of pigs as a surrogate for sars virus laboratory studies using tgev are safe to perform because the virus has no known adverse effect on humans further the data obtained using tgev should be applicable to the sars virus because both tgev and sars virus are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae fauquet et al 2005 and their physicochemical properties are similar although tgev has been utilized previously as a sars virus surrogate for studies of their genome expression thiel et al 2003 it has not been used in studies investigating the sampling and behavior of viral aerosols spendlove and fannin 1982 tseng and li 2005the methodology for generating storing and collecting viral aerosols has been reviewed by a number of authors sattar and ijaz 1987 cox 1989 mitchell 1995 buttner et al 2002 sattar and ijaz 2002 factors affecting the viability of a virus during nebulization include nebulizer type nebulizer air pressure nebulization time microorganism type and humidity of the dilution air adams et al 1982 sattar and ijaz 1987 marthi 1994 listed humidity temperature radiation and open-air factors cox et al 1973 as the most important parameters influencing the viability of airborne microorganisms the method of aerosol generation composition of the generation fluid sampling method and collection medium were deemed to be secondary parameters although some factors may be more important than others for a particular virus all of them play a role in viral aerosol viability spendlove and fannin 1982humidity in buildings can vary as a function of season and location consequently it is an important factor to study in terms of virus viability in the indoor environment bacteriophages influenza viruses and reoviruses each exhibit a unique dependence on relative humidity rh loosli et al 1943 hemmes et al 1962 adams et al 1982 trouwborst and de jong 1973 however the influence of humidity on the viability of coronaviruses such as the sars virus and tgev has not been studied previouslyall-glass impingers agi are commonly used for collecting viral aerosols spendlove and fannin 1982 sattar and ijaz 1987 sattar and ijaz 2002 tseng and li 2005 biosamplers were developed by willeke et al 1998 and their sampling performance for bacteria and fungi has been studied lin et al 1999 2000 agi-30 samplers collect most particles larger than 03 m in diameter buttner and stetzenbach 1991 the physical collection efficiency of the biosampler has been shown to be about 79 89 96 and 100 for 03- 05- 1- and 2-m particles respectively willeke et al 1998 biosamplers yield equivalent or higher culturable counts of bacteria relative to agi-30 samplers under the same conditions lin et al 1999 the physical sampling efficiency for both the agi-30 and the biosampler is less than 50 for particles with a diameter of less than 03 m and less than 10 for many particles with a diameter smaller than 01 m hogan et al 2005 these authors also showed that the recovery of airborne ms2 and t3 bacteriophages using an agi-30 sampler was greater than that using a biosampler however comparisons of biosampler and agi-30 performance have not been made for coronaviruses such as sars virus and tgevthe ability of samplers to collect airborne particles with submicrometer diameters is important because many particles produced by coughing and sneezing are less than a micrometer in diameter gerone et al 1966 found that 50 of the particles produced by sneezing and 73 of the particles produced by coughing were smaller than 1 m in diameter nicas et al 2005 correctly pointed out that most of the mass of particles produced by coughing and sneezing will initially be in particles larger than 1 m in diameter however the water portion of droplets smaller than about 25 m in diameter will evaporate almost instantaneously leaving much smaller virus-containing particles suspended in the air musher 2003filtration is an important method for reducing concentrations of biological particles inside of buildings the possibility of using hvac filters as a sampling system for airborne microorganisms has recently been proposed farnsworth et al 2006 in addition due to the threats of bioterrorism and pandemic influenza more consideration is being given to the virus removal efficiency of filters in hvac systems hitchcock et al 2006the objective of this study was to characterize factors affecting tgev nebulization and to select the best sampling procedure for measuring the airborne concentration of this coronavirus characterization of factors affecting virus nebulization can be an important step towards the use of viruses as test aerosols once we are able to produce reliable virus-containing aerosols that knowledge can be used in many ways for example respirator and ventilation filters can be tested for their virus filtration efficiencies and virologists and toxicologists can use these techniques in their health effects researchmeasurements of airborne tgev concentrations and the recovery of tgev from a filter medium were performed using an air filter testing apparatus suspensions of tgev were placed in a nebulizer and aerosolized into air flowing through the apparatus the tgev suspensions were titrated before and after nebulization on 36 different occasions to evaluate the effects of nebulization on virus viability the airborne virus particles were sampled at an rh of 30 50 70 and 90 using two different types of impinger samplers the virus particles were also collected on filter media inserted into the apparatus the tgev collected by the samplers and the tgev eluted from the test filters were quantified each combination of the four humidity levels with the two samplers was repeated three times for a total of 24 separate tests using these data we evaluated the tgevs airborne concentration and its recovery from test filters as a function of rh and sampler type each of the steps in this process is described in more detail in the following sectionsnebulization experiments were performed in a filter test apparatus fig 1 this apparatus was used by mccullough et al 1998 to study the penetration and loading of respirator filters with airborne fungi and bacteria tgev was aerosolized into the apparatus using a nebulizer and passed through a custom-made charge neutralizer containing a polonium-210 alpha particle source to imbue the virus with an equilibrium charge distribution this viral aerosol was then mixed thoroughly with filtered dilution air before it entered the test section the rh of the dilution air was controlled to 30 50 70 or 90 5 variation the test section consisted of a 15-cm-diameter vertical duct and a pneumatically controlled filter holder the total air flow rate in this section was 92 lmin the temperature during the experiments was approximately 23c

swine testicular st cells atcc crl1746 were used for the propagation of the test virus the cells were grown in eagles minimum essential medium mem mediatech herndon va containing 150 iuml penicillin 150 gml streptomycin 50 gml neomycin 1 gml fungizone and 8 fetal calf serum the purdue strain of tgev was propagated by infecting st cells grown to 8090 confluency the virus was allowed to adsorb to cells at 37c for 1 h followed by the addition of mem without fetal calf serum and incubation at 37c after the appearance of virus-induced cytopathic effects cpe generally 4872 h post-infection the cells were subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4000 g for 20 min and the viral supernatant was aliquoted in small vials followed by storage at 70c until use on the day of testing 50 ml of stock virus was thawed at ambient temperature and placed into a nebulizer the tgev concentration in the 50-ml suspensions used during the experiments ranged from 178  103 to 562  106 tcid50ml 50 tissue culture infecting dose per milliliter with a geometric mean of 851  104 tcid50ml the tgev titers utilized in this study were maximized to the best of our abilityto determine the titers of tgev serial tenfold dilutions of the nebulizer suspensions the collection liquid from the samplers and the filter eluates were prepared in maintenance medium followed by inoculation in st cells grown in 96-well plates using four wells per dilution after 4 days of incubation at 37c inoculated cells were examined microscopically for the appearance of virus-specific cpe and titers were calculated by the karber method karber 1931to determine the effect of nebulization parameters such as nebulizer type nebulization time and incoming air pressure on the virus the titers of tgev before and after nebulization were measured two nebulizers a 6-jet collison nebulizer bgi waltham mass and a plastic medical nebulizer retec aerosol generator cavitron corporation englewood cliffs nj were utilized in initial tests in subsequent tests only the collison nebulizer was used dry filtered air was supplied to the nebulizers at pressures ranging from 7 to 15 psi for tests during which impinger sampling and collection by filters were performed air pressure to the collison nebulizer was fixed at 10 psi the liquid aerosolization rates for virus suspensions were between 01 and 02 mlmin depending on the type of nebulizer and the pressureairborne virus concentrations were determined using agis agi-30 ace glass vineland nj and biosamplers skc eighty four pa attached to sampling inlets inserted into the test apparatus the inlets with an inside diameter of 095 cm were positioned about 50 cm upstream from the mounting location of test filters although the inlets were perpendicular to the flow direction losses during sampling were minimal because the flow inside the apparatus was slow enough that a representative sample could be drawn brockmann 2001 the flow rate for both samplers was 125 lmin and sampling time was limited to 10 min to minimize both possible stress on viruses and evaporation of the maintenance medium used as the collection liquid no corrections were applied to account for incomplete physical collection of the airborne viruses or for possible inactivation of tgev during the sampling procedureto examine the recovery of tgev from a filter we selected an hvac filter medium these filters riga-flo 200ph camfil farr rancho dominguez calif were made from a microfine fiberglass laminated to a reinforcing backing according to the manufacturers specifications this class of filter is rated merv 14 by the american society of heating refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers ashrae standard 522-1999 ashrae 2000 merv 14 filters have been measured in laboratory tests to have efficiencies of 7585 for particles with diameters of 0310 m and 90 or greater for particles with diameters of 1010 m virus-laden particles with a diameter smaller than 03 m would be expected to be collected with at least 75 efficiency by diffusion test filter samples were cut from a regular-pleated hvac filter media and placed into a plastic holder that was sandwiched between gasketed flanges using the pneumatically controlled mounting system the portion of the test filters exposed to the tgev aerosol was a circle diameter 14 cm leading to a face velocity at the filter of 10 cms during each of the 24 separate tests a filter was exposed to virus-laden air for 10 min immediately after nebulization the filter was removed and cut into small pieces that were eluted with 50 ml 3 beef extract005 m glycine solution ph 88 using a vortex mixer for 1 min the ph of the eluate was immediately adjusted to ph 75 with 1 m hydrochloric acidto assess the effect of nebulization time the titers of tgev in the nebulizer suspensions after 10 or 30 min were compared with those of the original suspensions these times were long enough for 50 ml of a suspension to be circulated through the nebulizer many times therefore we can assume that almost all of the virus in the nebulizer experienced the stress of nebulization at least once to compare titers before and after nebulization the quantity  is defined here as 1documentclass12ptminimal

the data indicate that neither the type of nebulizer the nebulizer pressure nor the nebulization time was an important factor affecting survival of tgev during nebulization ijaz et al 1987 found similar results after a 10-min nebulization of human coronaviruses poliovirus type 1 rotavirus and rhinovirus these findings may be explained by the small size of viruses because they are small they have little inertia when moving and therefore do not experience much physical stress due to acceleration or deceleration and impaction during nebulization viruses with structures differing from those of tgev may show a different resultas shown in fig 2 aerosolization efficiency calculated using eq 2 decreased as a function of rh sampling with biosamplers led to higher aerosolization efficiency than sampling with agi-30 samplers at 30 and 50 rh the difference was statistically significant at p  0049 and p  0001 respectively this suggests that relative to agi-30 samplers biosamplers may have a higher physical sampling efficiency for the tgev-containing particles andor sample in a way that reduces inactivation of tgev

our finding of higher virus levels measured with the biosampler for the coronavirus tgev is in general opposite the results reported by hogan et al 2005 showing higher airborne concentrations measured using the agi-30 for ms2 and t3 bacteriophages however our aerosolization efficiency was similar to those of reoviruses nebulized using a chicago atomizer without prehumidification of secondary air adams et al 1982 these authors also found that aerosolization efficiencies increased by approximately tenfold following the prehumidifying of the secondary air in the chicago atomizertwo important processes may affect the measurements of aerosolization efficiency in our study 1 the viruses may have been damaged during sampling and 2 some of them may have passed through the sampler without being collected these processes were disregarded in the calculations which would lead to underestimation of true aerosolization efficienciesagranovski et al 2005 developed and tested a bubbler for sampling airborne microorganisms and utilized it to sample vaccinia virus in laboratory studies with a recovery of about 90 over 6 h of sampling the authors were careful to note that vaccinia strains are more robust than many other viruses when agranovski et al 2004 utilized the bubbler to sample sars virus experimentally they recovered more than 10 of the virus in 2 h of sampling a comparison of these data to the results from our study with tgev suggests that the bubbler may be a more suitable sampler for coronaviruses than the agi-30 and the biosamplerthe two different recoveries calculated by eqs 3 and 4 are summarized in table 2 because some of the measured airborne virus concentrations were zero corresponding filter recoveries based on airborne virus concentration ra could not be calculated ra estimated using agi-30 samplers showed higher values than ra from biosamplers this could be explained if the sampling efficiency for agi-30 samplers were lower than that of the biosampler some ra showed more than 100 recovery loss of survivability or infectivity during sampling could be the reason for these observations both ra and rn showed large variations

table 2 shows that no virus was found in the three agi-30 samples at 50 70 or 90 rh for the biosampler virus was observed in only one of three samples at 70 and 90 rh these results indicate that the sampling of viable airborne tgev became more difficult as the rh increased and that the biosampler sampled tgev somewhat more effectively than the agi-30virus recovery according to eq 3 could not be evaluated for all conditions due to the inability of the samplers to yield sufficient viable tgev for quantification if it were possible higher titers in the nebulizer suspension might have yielded quantifiable concentrations of tgev in the samplers however our methods were optimized to produce titers that were as high as possible for tgev propagated in st cells the inability to quantify tgev in the samples may be caused primarily by inactivation during travel through the air and during sampling in addition the recovery calculated in eq 3 may also be inaccurate because the size-selective sampling efficiency of agi-30 samplers and biosamplers is low for particles the size of individual viruses hogan et al 2005 and the size distribution of the tgev-containing particles being sampled is not knownfigure 3 shows the results for virus recovery according to eq 4 as a function of rh overall recovery was less than 10 potential reasons for recoveries less than 100 include 1 inactivation during nebulization 2 inactivation during transport through the air 3 inactivation during collection and retention on the test filter and 4 penetration through the test filter because nebulization losses were shown to be minimal and the filters tested in this study were fairly efficient most losses are probably due to inactivation during transport or during collection andor retention on the test filter the results in table 2 and fig 3 suggest that eq 4 is a more useful expression for evaluating tgev recovery from filters than eq 3

our findings indicate that the survivability of tgev decreased substantially in the short time between aerosolization and sampling in addition the higher recovery of tgev at 30 rh suggests that this virus may survive longer in an airborne state and after sampling or collection at low rh than at high rh akers 1969 has proposed that humidity-dependent inactivation of aerosolized virus occurs immediately after they are sprayed and once established does not drastically changed with the aging of the aerosol it is generally believed that lipid-containing viruses including tgev survive better at low levels of rh and that the high rh levels are more conducive to the airborne survival of lipid-free viruses sattar and ijaz 1987many airborne viruses are affected greatly by the rh of the air in this study tgev exhibited a better survival at low rh than at high humidity although the reasons for this behavior are uncertain they may be related to tgevs structure in general influenza virus survives best at low rh and low temperature loosli et al 1943 hemmes et al 1962 reoviruses show the least airborne viability near 50 rh adams et al 1982 while bacteriophage ms2 aerosolized from 01 m nacl was found to have the least relative recovery near 70 rh trouwborst and de jong 1973 unlike coronaviruses such as tgev and influenza viruses neither reoviruses nor ms2 have an envelope our results combined with those just mentioned suggest that enveloped viruses may be equipped to survive more effectively at low rh than at high rh whereas non-enveloped viruses may behave differentlytrouwborst and de jong 1973 suggested that the inactivation of airborne virus is related to the airwater interface and that this may be an important mechanism for lipid-containing viruses like tgev many biological materials are hygroscopic and demonstrate hysteresis in their water sorption isotherms following wet dissemination the rate of desiccation depends on the prevailing rh the most portable target molecules of rh stress are outer membrane phospholipids and proteins cox 1989 this mechanism may partly explain the sensitivity of tgev to relative humiditytgev was nebulized then sampled using agi-30 impingers and biosamplers and finally collected on an hvac test filter to measure the effects of nebulization stress and the recovery of viable virus from the filter titration of tgev in an aqueous suspension before and after the suspension was nebulized indicated that the act of nebulization did not inactivate the virus not surprisingly our results indicate that neither the type of nebulizer the pressure of the air supplied to the nebulizer nor the duration of nebulization affected the viability of tgev significantly virus recoveries calculated based on the amount of the tgev-containing suspension nebulized rn showed a dependence on rh with higher virus recovery at 30 rh than at higher humidities the reason for this behavior is uncertain but the results are consistent with those of previous investigations and suggest that enveloped viruses have a different relationship between virus recovery and humidity than non-enveloped viruses aerosolization efficiencies were also higher at lower rh and biosamplers collected airborne tgev viruses at a significantly higher efficiency than agi-30 samplers at 30 and 50 rh all of the results reported here are specific to tgev and the extent to which these results with tgev apply to other coronaviruses like the sars virus has not yet been tested however tgevs behavior is likely to be comparable to that of other coronaviruses due to structural similarities other viruses particularly those from other genera may behave differentlylike influenza virus many coronaviruses can use the endocytic pathway to enter cells 19 once inside the endosome the challenge for viruses is delivering their genetic material across the membrane and into the cytosol for viral replication all enveloped viruses have membrane proteins that facilitate the fusion of their lipid envelope with the host cell membrane 20 coronavirus particles possess at their surface the spike s envelope glycoprotein which is a class i fusion protein 21 whereas the structure and function of the prototypical class i fusion protein influenza virus hemagglutinin ha is well understood structurefunction relationships for coronavirus s proteins are not well characterized for coronaviruses the s protein mediates virus entry and determines cell tropism and pathogenesis 22 like influenza virus ha the coronavirus s protein has two primary functions 1 it controls the binding of the virus to a cell membrane receptor and 2 it mediates membrane fusion between the viral and host membranes 20 in general receptor binding is controlled by the s1 domain of the protein while membrane fusion is mediated by the s2 domain a conformational change in the s2 domain is believed to drive the viral membrane to fuse with the host membrane for most coronaviruses this conformational change is triggered by the acidification of the endosome although ph-independent fusion can also be observedit is generally believed that all class i fusion proteins follow a common fusion pathway that has been well-established in the prototypical class i influenza virus class i fusion proteins go through a multi-step process to achieve a fusion pore that begins with a fusion protein conformational change triggered by low ph during the conformational change the fusion protein unfolds and thrusts the fusion peptide into the hydrophobic region of the host membrane next the protein folds back bringing the anchored membrane in close contact with the viral membrane until a stalk-like structure is formed the stalk structure results from the mixing of the outer leaflet of the host membrane with the viral membrane referred to as hemifusion after a short lag time the stalk is converted into a fusion pore through which the viral contents can exit it may be necessary for multiple fusion proteins to work in concert to bend the membrane to induce fusionanalogous to influenza ha it is believed that the coronavirus s protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage prior to fusion activation 22 proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the s protein including the fusion peptide 23 because proteolytic cleavage dictates fusion competency the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is another key factor in tropism of coronavirus a dramatic example of this is human sars-cov the bound virus is able to fuse at the cell surface in absence of acidic ph when exposed to exogenous proteases 24 this route of entry may even be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more efficient that the endosomal pathway 24 in this case proteolytic cleavage changed the fusion pathway by combining single particle fusion with proteinaceous supported bilayers and microfluidics the sequence of triggers can be controlled and the associated fusion pathway and kinetics quantitatively measuredbaby hamster kidney-21 bhk-21 cells obtained from the american type culture collection atcc manassas va were grown and maintained in dulbeccos modified eagle medium

used either with pdms wells or microfluidic devicesto form the pdms wells a thin sheet of pdms was made in a petri dish using 101 elastomercrosslinker mixture of sylgard 184 robert mckeown company branchburg nj the pdms was baked for 3 h at 80 c cut into small squares approximately the same size as a coverslip and a hole punched through each square to form the wells pdms squares were then attached to a clean glass coverslips which formed the bottom of the wells the approximate volume of a well was 100 lmicrofluidic devices for the fusion experiments were fabricated using soft lithography the microchannel pattern was designed using the cad software program l-edit tanner eda and a master of the flow pattern was made on a silicon wafer at cornell nanoscale science and

liposomesintegrity of bilayers and diffusion of the lipids within it was examined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching frap bilayers were formed following the above procedures inside pdms wells r18 was used to label the bilayer and carry out the photobleaching experiments once formed bilayers were gently scratched with a dissection tool to remove a thin section to aid in focusing on

previously described for fapn-blebs the activity of hapn and empty vector cell blebs in solution was tested using bulk fluorescence measurements in fluorometer photon technologies international inc at an excitationemission of 380460 nm the substrate for hapn h-ala-amc was purchased from bachem a 5050 mixture of blebs and h-ala-amc substrate at 270 m in a 50 mm tris buffer at ph 74 were mixed in a quartz cuvette and intensity of the mixture was monitored for 30 minbleb-derived supported bilayers containing hapn were formed in microfluidic channels as previously described for fapn-sbs the substrate at concentration of 270 m in 50 mm tris buffer at ph 74 was drawn into the channel at a flow rate of 100 lmin for 2 min the fluorescence intensity of the channel was observed at 10 magnification at an excitationemission of 380455 nm a control channel containing an empty vector bleb-derived supported bilayer devoid of exogenous apn proteins was subjected to the same conditions as described above
fig s5 summarizes the enzyme activity assay results in fig s5a blebs with and without hapn were loaded into cuvettes and the fluorescence monitored temporally using a fluorometer after the substrate was added the empty vector blebs show no appreciable fluorescence while the hapn blebs continue to increase in signal as increasing amount of substrate is cleaved during the course of the experiment in fig s5b supported bilayers with and without hapn are loaded into a microfluidic channels with substrate the microfluidic device is monitored at specific time points and the two channels are compared in the inset in the control case no fluorescence is detected above the background but the hapn-sb shows significant intensity after several hoursin order for class i fusion proteins to become fusion-competent they must first be activated by proteolytic cleavage a modification performed by cellular proteases there are numerous enzymes capable of proteolytically cleaving the coronavirus spike protein these proteases can be found in either the intra- or extra-cellular environment for example cathepsin proteases found in the endosomal compartment are naturally used to breakdown proteins taken up into the lysosome 33 once a virus gets endocytosed cathepsins can also cleave the coronavirus spike protein 25 34 35 36 37 trypsin is a common extracellular protease found in the digestive tract of many vertebrates 38 to break down proteins during digestion 38 we show here that trypsin is also capable of cleaving the spike protein of coronavirusescleavage likely occurs at two distinct sites for coronavirus s at the junction of the s1s2 domains as well as within the s2 domain s2 39 proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the s protein including the fusion peptide 23 for some coronaviruses cleavage at s1s2 is necessary to allow subsequent cleavage at s2 and allow the s2 domain to respond a low ph trigger that initiates the conformational change required for fusion 39 in other coronaviruses in particular alphacoronaviruses like fcov-1683 the s1s2 site does not need to be cleaved in these cases activation is likely mediated solely through the s2 cleavage sitewe used trypsin as a means to activate fcov-1683 s to confirm that trypsin can proteolytically cleave fcov-1683 s in an appropriate manner fcov-1683 viral suspensions were ultracentrifuged at 42000 rpm in a tla 55 rotor using an optima max-e ultracentrifuge beckman coulter for 2 h at 4 c the viral pellets were resuspended in 50 l of pbs non-treated sample or pbs

containing 05 m cathepsin b calbiochem the samples were incubated at 37 c for 1 h except the cathepsin-treated sample which was incubated for 15 min at 37 c all samples were then subjected to treatment with the deglycosylating enzyme pngase f new england biolabs using 2500 units and supplied buffer at 37 c for 16 h this was done to avoid having differentially glycosylated species of s protein lds loading buffer invitrogen with dtt 50 mm final was added to samples and were subjected to 5 min 95 c incubation for denaturation the samples were then analyzed by western blot using fcov-s-specific mouse mab 22g64 provided by dr ed dubovi animal health diagnostic center new york state college of veterinary medicine cornell university followed by incubation with hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg abcamas shown in fig s6 cathepsin b and trypsin treatment yield major cleavage products at approximately 100 kda while in the non-treated sample the majority of s protein migrated as a single band around 200 kda indicating little cleavage event occurred without protease treatment these results show that trypsin cleaves fcov 1683 s in a similar way as does cathepsin b and are consistent with published results for this virus cleaved with cathepsin b 25membrane fusion assays were conducted with total internal reflection fluorescence tirf microscopy using an inverted zeiss

the objective in this setup two lasers can be used simultaneously to excite different color fluorophores we used 561 nm and 488 nm excitation wavelengths from solid-state lasers these were coupled into the optical pathway of the microscope using a laser tirf 3 slider carl zeiss inc which controlled the angles of incidence exceeding the critical angle for glasswater interface 62 ensured total internal reflection of the lasers and created evanescent waves about 100 nm thick at this thickness the evanescent waves excited fluorophores positioned within the supported bilayer or virions labeled r18 the excitation laser light was band-pass filtered through a semrock 74 he gfpmrfp filter cube and then combined with a dichroic mirror before being focused on the outer edge of the back aperture of the objective the fluorescence emission signal was filtered through a 52531 and 61657 nm dual band-pass emission filter and then sent to an electron multiplying ccd camera hamamatsu imageem c9100-13 bridgewater njthe images acquired during the membrane fusion assays were analyzed using both imagej nih and matlab mathworks fusing particles were manually selected in imagej and the fluorescence intensity in a 4  4 pixel region around each particle was collected as a function of time in videos where background noise was high due to a large amount of fusion events a rolling ball background subtraction algorithm was applied to all of the images to remove excess background noise as the fluorophores diffused into the membrane after hemifusion the rolling ball algorithm determines the local background for every pixel by averaging over a large circular region around the pixel this background value is then subtracted from the original image the fluorescence trajectories for the particles were then imported to matlab mathworks for further analysis a code written in matlab determined the onset time of the dequenching spike for each particle by finding the

the accuracy with which n and k
h can be determined depends on both the number of experimental observations and the number of steps in the process 40 to accurately estimate n from a gamma distribution a minimum number of a fusion events must occur for statistical significance for example to distinguish a 2-step process from a 3-step process ie n  2 from n  3 a minimum of 50 fusion events must be observed 40 the number of fusion events that occurred during each experiment reported here varied from 70 to 120pure liposome solutions prepared as described in the methods section self-assemble on glass to form supported bilayers via vesicle fusion 41 42 proteoliposomes on the other hand generally do not readily form supported bilayers on their own we discovered that proteoliposomes derived from cell blebs could be induced to form supported bilayers with the addition of pure liposomes 18 we describe this self-assembly process here in the context of forming fapn-supported bilayers fapn-sb as substrates for fcov fusion studies the process is illustrated in fig 1
top and begins with the formation of cell blebs containing fapn the detailed procedure for forming cell blebs containing fapn from bhk cells can be found in the methods section fapn blebs are then used to form proteinaceous supported bilayers as will be described in detail next once the proteinaceous supported bilayer is formed fcov binds to fapn localizing the virus within the evanescent wave and enabling single particle fusion experiments that will be described in a later sectionto visualize the formation of the supported bilayer from fapn-blebs derived from bhk cells the bleb membranes were labeled with a lipophilic fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine r18 see methods section a small aliquot of the labeled bleb solution was added to a pdms well and incubated for 10 min at room temperature during this time blebs contact and adsorb to the glass surface excess blebs that did not adsorb to the glass surface were removed by gently rinsing the well with buffer a 2 mm cacl2 10 mm hepes 150 mm nacl at ph 74 at this stage the adsorbed intact blebs stick to the glass surface as intact proteoliposomes as seen in fig 1 t  0 image as punctuate spotsto induce the formation of a supported bilayer from the adsorbed blebs we formulated liposomes to match closely the bhk endosomal membrane composition 26 referred to as bhk-liposome and added this solution to the pdms well containing the adsorbed blebs in this experiment the bhk-liposomes are devoid of fluorophore labels this labeling scheme assists in observing the formation of the supported bilayer as the initially punctuate blebs rupture and the r18 disperses throughout the newly-formed planar bilayer fig 1 bottom image series note that as the r18 spreads in the bilayer and gets diluted with the unlabeled bhk lipids the fluorescence signal increases due to fluorophore dequenchingbilayer formation is verified by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching frap in this technique a laser beam is used to photobleach a 20 m diameter spot in the newly-formed fluorescently-labeled r18 supported bilayer the recovery of the fluorescence in this photobleached area is used to determine the 2d mobility of r18 embedded in the planar supported bilayer which in turn verifies that the r18 is no longer confined to discrete bleb vesicles adsorbed to the glass surface but freely moving throughout a 2d bilayer plane frap interrogates a macroscale area microns and thus is useful for characterizing how well the bilayer has formed over this length scale note that the largest population of blebs is on the order of 500 nm in diameter fig s1 so if the blebs have not ruptured into a contiguous planar bilayer then the fluorescence will not be able to recover after the sample is photobleached this lack of recovery was confirmed by preparing samples containing only adsorbed cell blebs no addition of bhk-liposomes photobleached spots did not recover on these samplesfor mobile samples we obtain two quantitative measurements from these experiments the mobile fraction and the 2d diffusion coefficient samples were prepared on glass surfaces in pdms wells as described above fig 2
is a typical fluorescence recovery of r18 in a fapn-sbs from this plot the recovery is nearly restored to 100 indicating that the mobile fraction of r18 in the fapn-sb is quite high the reported diffusion coefficient averaged over several similarly-prepared samples is 035  0005 m2s mobile fraction and diffusion coefficient values compare well with a control bilayer made of only r18-labeled bhk-liposomes see supplementary information for data fig s2note that the recovery curve is smooth and fits well to the 2d diffusion model black line irregular recovery could indicate either disconnected isolated bilayer patches that did not heal to form a contiguous film over this length scale or the presence of lipid microdomain formation this data indicates that the bilayer has a relatively uniform distribution and is contiguous other possibilities for the structure of the bilayer include partial bleb rupture such as only the outer leaflet fusing to the bhk-liposomes however because the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions in the pure bhk-liposome slb and fapn-sb bilayers are comparable this structure can be ruled out by the following argument if the blebs were only partially fused then the r18 trapped in the inner leaflet could not readily exchange with the surrounding lipids after being photobleached this behavior would manifest as a slower recovery and reduced mobile fraction relative to the pure bhk-liposome case over the same timescale of recovery experimentonce the bilayer was formed we verified that the fapn proteins were incorporated into the supported bilayer and the active extracellular end was oriented facing the bulk solution ie not inverted towards the glass support by labeling with a fapn-specific antibody against the extracellular portion of the protein details of these experiments and controls are provided in the methods section fig s4 and confirm that fapn is in the bilayer and oriented properly next we tested apn activity in the blebs and support bilayers using an enzyme activity assay see methods section fig s5 summarizes the enzyme activity assay and the results show that apn is enzymatically active in the supported bilayer derived from cell blebstaken together the antibody binding assay and the enzymatic assay results corroborate that apn protein is functional and maintains its native activity and orientation in the supported bilayer we note that while the r18 and lipids are mobile in the fapn-sb fig 2 the proteins do not appear to be mobile to the same extent fig s3 because apn is the binding receptor for the virus immobility will reduce the strength of binding avidity of the virus to the supported bilayer however as long as one receptor bond in able to hold the virus in close proximity to the supported bilayer and within the evanescent field prior to fusion initiation we can still track individual virus fusion events using tirfm as will be shown in the next sectionwe coated microfluidic channels with supported bilayers devoid of or containing fapn to make the bilayers either empty-vector blebs or fapn blebs were used following the procedure described above for pdms wells but modified slightly to be compatible with a microfluidic device a description of this procedure is in the methods sectionwe prepared two suspensions of fcov virus the first was treated with the protease trypsin 25 gml for 15 min at 37 c prior to fluorescence labeling and the second suspension was left untreated fig s6 demonstrates by western blot analysis that trypsin treatment of fcov-1683 virions results in proper cleavage activation of the s protein this cleavage step is necessary to prime the s protein for the fusion assay that will be carried out following virus bindingnext suspensions of fluorescently-labeled trypsin-treated fcov were sent through the channels and incubated for 20 min during this time virus bound to the fapn in the supported bilayer but virus introduced to the channels containing empty-vector-sbs showed no visible binding fig 3
 comparing these results emphasizes the requirement that the supported bilayer contain fapn to localize the virus at the bilayer surfaceto monitor and distinguish the intermediate steps in the fusion pathway from each other in the single particle fusion assay we use a dual-color labeling scheme fig 4
 as described in the methods section here the viral membrane is labeled with a green-emitting lipophilic fluorophore r110c18 and the internal contents are labeled with a red-emitting fluorophore srb with this scheme hemifusion of the outer leaflets is marked by fluorescence dequenching of r110c18 when the outer leaflets mix pore formation is marked by a drop in srb fluorescence at the fusion site indicating release of the internal contents these colors are co-localized in one particle by simultaneous monitoring of both emission wavelengths using tirfm in this way three important time intervals can be obtained for each individual particle 1 the time for the onset of hemifusion 2 the lag time between hemifusion and pore formation and 3 the time when the internal contents is releasedin our assay membrane fusion between bound trypsin-treated fcov and supported bilayers is primarily initiated with acidic buffer although on occasion some cleaved viruses spontaneously fuse prior to acidification to test the influence of triggering ph on fusion kinetics buffer solutions 150 mm nacl 15 mm mes 5 mm citric acid pre-calibrated over a range of acidic ph values up to ph 70 were used each solution was sent through a microfluidic channel at a flow rate of 100 lmin for 2 min to acidify the system the time at which acidification of the flow cell occurred was marked by an obvious decrease in fluorescence of the ph-sensitive fluorophore oregon green dhpe present in the supported bilayers for this purpose tirfm images were collected at an interval of 100 ms for three or 4 min a series of images of a single virion undergoing hemifusion triggered at ph 53 is provided in fig 5
a the dequenching spike is traced in the plot beneath the images the time at which the onset of hemifusion occurs following acidification at t  0 is declared as the start of the dequenching spike for each individual virus fusion event in the field of viewa cumulative distribution curve for each triggering ph was generated by plotting the frequency of hemifusion events as a function of the times of the onset of each hemifusion event for a given triggering ph a curve like in fig 5b is then fit with a cumulative gamma distribution equation 1 to estimate the kinetic parameters1ph0tkhntn1nekhttwhere k
h is the hemifusion rate constant t is time and n is an additional fit parameter often correlated to the number of steps or the number of fusion proteins that act together to initiate fusion 5a gamma distribution is commonly used to fit single particle kinetics of membrane-enveloped viral fusion because individual fusion events occur independently of each other the gamma distribution describes a multistep reaction scheme where each step is a stochastic poisson process with a rate constant k this model has been used to analyze the kinetics of single particle influenza fusion 5 7 and because of the similarity between the class i fusion proteins of ha and s this model is used to analyze coronavirus fusion here the probability distribution was fit to our data using a non-linear least squares fitting algorithm
fig 5cd summarizes the hemifusion kinetic parameters obtained for trypsin-treated fcov over a range of triggering ph 40 to 60 we note that at phs above 60 the number of fusing particles was too low to obtain statistically significant kinetic parameters the data presented here ph 4060 corresponds to experiments where at least 50 fusion events occurred what is clear from this data is that fcov-1683 s cleaved with trypsin requires at least a mildly an acidic environment to fuse but the rate dependence on ph is negligible this may indicate that there is a mildly acidic ph threshold at which fcov-1683 s becomes fusogenically active as such we show here that acidic ph may be considered as a subtle trigger for fusion along with the better characterized triggers of receptor binding and proteolytic processing of sa second finding from these experiments is that trypsin can substitute for cathepsins in activating membrane fusion in the absence of trypsin treatment the total number of fusion events is less than 10 of the number of events that occur with treatment post acidification data not showna third finding is that protease activation can occur before the virus binds the apn receptor in contrast to the situation with sars-cov where the virus must first be bound to the receptor before cleavage it is interesting to note that fcov-1683 is one of the coronaviruses that does not need to be cleaved at the s1s2 junction and so this result highlights that there may be differences in receptor priming of fusion depending on how individual coronaviruses are proteolytically activatedthe lag time between the onset of hemifusion and pore formation can be determined from the relative time stamps of the onset of hemifusion dequenching and the onset of the release of fluorophores initially inside the virion in fig 6
 a series of images of a dual-labeled trypsin-treated fcov fusing to the supported bilayer is shown in fig 6a with the intensity quantified in fig 6b the initiating ph in this experiment was 45 in fig 6b it is straightforward to determine the lag time as a difference between the dequenching spike of the green label and the drop in fluorescence of the red label lag times for the virions in this sample are cataloged and plotted in the bar graph in fig 6c fitting this histogram with an exponential decay we determine that the rate constant for the formation of the pore is 007  001 s1 pore formation was also conducted with an initiating ph of 50 here the rate constant for the formation of the pore is 009 s1 for both initiating phs the transition to pore formation histogram fit best to a one-step processthese experiments reveal that fcov exhibits a distinct hemifusion event before the release of internal label which supports that coronavirus like influenza proceeds to pore formation via a stalk intermediate no release of internal red label was observed prior to hemifusion of dual-labeled virionswith our results it is now also possible to compare the fusion kinetics obtained for cov s with the prototypical protein of this class influenza ha in our previous single particle kinetics studies of influenza x-31 ha membrane fusion 7 we found hemifusion and pore formation rate constants at ph 45 of k
h  02 s1 and k
pore  008 s1 respectively here for fcov s at the same ph we obtain k
h  005 s1 and k
pore  007 s1 respectively one main difference we observe between ha and s is the ph-dependence of the hemifusion rate constant fcov-1683 s apparently requires an acidic environment to fuse but the rate dependence on ph is negligible influenza on the other hand exhibits ph-dependent k
h
5 7 however the pore formation kinetics for both viruses is approximately the same this result is not surprising because the pore formation step is not believed to be ph dependent 43 44 but controlled to some extent by the physico-chemical properties eg lipid composition protein content cholesterol quantity etc of the membranes involved in fusion since cell blebs can be made from various cell types the method presented here for forming supported bilayers from blebs also provides a new way to interrogate the impact of cell membrane type on viral fusion kineticsa second difference between influenza ha and fcov s is the value of n obtained from the kinetic analysis n represents the number of steps in a multi-step scheme convoluted into a gamma distribution in the case of influenza n has been interpreted as the number of ha proteins that work in parallel to induce hemifusion 5 7 for influenza n varies depending on the ph but within the range of ph 40 to 60 is 3 using the same experimental acidification conditions employed in these studies in the case of fcov s if this interpretation was used our data indicates that on average 12 s proteins are required to induce hemifusion across the same ph range for this interpretation a single s protein appears to have more energy stored within it to induce fusion compared to ha an alternative interpretation is that n in this case simply means that 1 step is dominating the kinetics and that step apparently does not vary much with ph future experiments are required to shed more light on the mechanism of fcov fusion and provide a conclusive interpretation of this parameter such studies are now ongoing in our laboratorythe formation of proteinaceous supported bilayers using the cell blebbing technique opens the possibility for quantitative characterization of membrane fusion kinetics of any enveloped virus that binds to membrane proteins in the host membrane beyond coronaviruses and also enables studies of unknown viral receptors in the cell membrane because supported bilayers can be made from many cell types 14 17 this method can be used to obtain kinetics of virus fusion as it depends on the kind of cell membrane host in particular for the many viruses that engage multiple receptors or co-receptors this method allows the role of individual receptors to be defined in the context of the fusion event through biochemical means proteins can be expressed or suppressed in the plasma cell membrane thus supported bilayers can be tailor-made for fundamental studies of specific host-pathogen interactions that mitigate infection in addition by the incorporation of pseudoparticles 9 the method may be expanded to study viruses of high biomedical importance that require enhanced biosafety procedures bsl-3 and bsl-4in this work we obtain the membrane fusion kinetics of a less-studied but clinically important class i fusion protein coronavirus s overall the fusion results here recapitulate what is observed in vivo that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors and that membrane fusion is both receptor- and protease-dependent these results indicate that the in vitro method described here is a suitable substitute for studying fusion in vivo but our method of creating and combining proteinaceous bilayers with single particle tracking now provides a convenient way to obtain quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway which to our knowledge have not been obtained before the single particle approach combined with microfluidics offers versatile control over the sequence of triggers of binding protease exposure and acidification control of the sequence of these triggers is important as the order may define the fusion pathway tissue tropism and pathogenicity of coronaviruses systematically varying these complex triggers using this platform provides a new way to study this viruss ability to rapidly adapt to other hosts versatile platforms are of critical importance to providing data that can be leveraged to limit the infection of the human population especially in light of the recently-emerging strain of mers-covthe novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread all over the world at an unprecedented rate since its outbreak in december 2019 more than 200 countries or territories have confirmed cases and over 84 million individuals have been infected leading to more than 450000 deaths as of june 18 2020 covid-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who on january 30 and declared a pandemic on march 11 2020as recommended by the who rd blueprint expert group clinical improvements for patients with covid-19 can be classified in a seven-category ordinal scale 1so far there are only eight clinical trials for covid-19 completed with results published among them two trials were for hydroxychloroquine with relatively small sample sizes 30 patients for the trial of chen et al 2 and 36 patients for the trial of gautret et al 3 although the trial conducted by gautret et al 3 yielded a significant result the sample size was too small to draw any convincing conclusion the trial of cai et al 4 compared favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir with a total sample size of 80 patients leading to a significant result p004 chen et al 5 conducted a trial comparing favipiravir with arbidol which had a total sample size of 240 patients and yielded an insignificant result the trial of grein et al 6 was a single-arm trial for remdesivir and the estimated clinical improvement rate at day 18 was 068 to determine the efficacy of lianhuaqingwen lhqw capsule a compounded chinese herb medicine hu et al 7 conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial and reported a statistically significant difference in the symptom fever fatigue coughing recovery rate between the treatment group and the control group 915 vs 824 p022 however the trial did not include a placebo in the control group to implement a double-blinding scheme despite the urgency nature of the pandemic their argument for unblinding due to ethical reasons seems to be unsound due to the conscious and subconscious psychological tendencies of humans including both clinicians and patients bias often arises in an open-label study not only does unblinding lead to potential selection bias but it may also cause placebo effects for patients who took lhqw 8-11 which thus shed doubts on the clinical benefits of lhqw in particular the rate of symptom recovery is related to disease relief or symptomatic manifestations such as fever fatigue and coughing soft end points for which placebo effects are known to be strong and more discernible 10 however the lhqw and control groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings hard end points for which placebo effects are less perceptible because generally placebos can neither alter the pathophysiology of the disease nor cure it we take the three randomized clinical trials conducted by cao et al 12 on lopinavir-ritonavir and by wang et al 13 and beigel et al 14 on remdesivir as examples to illustrate statistical issues and lessons learned as they have drawn great attention in the clinical communitythe lopinavir trial for suppression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in china 12 was conducted with record speed from january 18 to february 3 2020 the date of enrollment of the last patient patient recruitment up to a planned sample size is often the bottle neck of trial conduct this was not the case with severe covid-19 due to the abundance of hospitalized patients during that period of time in this trial eligible patients were randomized at a 11 ratio to either the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group 400 mg and 100 mg orally twice daily plus the standard care or the standard care alone for 14 days no placebo was used for blinding because no placebo was prepared due to the urgency of the trial therefore both patients and investigators were aware of the treatment identity each patient received following the who seven-ordinal scale 1 the primary end point adopted by the trial 12 was the time to clinical improvement which was defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points from the status at randomization eg from point 6 to point 4 or from point 5 to point 3 or live discharge from the hospital whichever came first the sample size was increased from 160 to 199 since the result with the enrolled 160 patients did not reach statistical significance as a final conclusion cao et al 12 reported no benefit with the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond the standard care with a hazard ratio hr of 124 and the associated 95 ci 090-172wang et al 13 conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial with remdesivir at ten hospitals in hubei china overall 236 patients were enrolled from february 6 to march 12 2020 and were randomly assigned to the remdesivir group 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 and the placebo group at a 21 ratio in the original design the trial planned to recruit 453 patients with 302 to remdesivir and 151 to placebo but no patients were enrolled after march 12 due to no eligible patients being available in the hubei province as a consequence the statistical power of the study was reduced from 80 to 58 the primary clinical end point was the time to improvement within 28 days clinical improvement was defined as a two-point improvement from an adjusted six-category ordinal scale from the who seven-category ordinal scale in conclusion remdesivir did not show statistically significant clinical benefit compared with the placebo in terms of the hr 123 95 ci 087-175beigel et al 14 reported a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection this trial had a total sample size of 1059 patients 538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo the median recovery time of the remdesivir group was 11 95 ci 9-12 days and 15 95 ci 13-19 days for the placebo group the rate ratio for recovery was 132 95 ci 047-104 p001 which was statistically significant in favor of remdesivir the kaplan-meier estimates of mortality at 14 days were 71 with remdesivir and 119 with the placebo and the hr for death was 070 95 ci 047-104 remdesivir was shown to be superior to the placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and in terms of the hr for death there was no significant difference between the two groupsso far only one treatment remdesivir has been shown to be effective by a randomized clinical trial but the other remdesivir trial failed to demonstrate its superiority over the placebo as the pandemic of covid-19 will not be controlled anytime soon the aforementioned three clinical trials 12-14 provide extremely valuable information on the treatments of covid-19 and the corresponding trial design and analysis however several important issues have been identified in the statistical analysis design and implementation of the three trials we point out the statistical problems that arose in the three trials 12-14 and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves for the time to improvement or recovery using more appropriate approaches our in-depth and comprehensive analyses yield new insights on the design and analysis for ongoing and future covid-19 clinical trialsthe log-rank test 15 is the most commonly used method in survival analysis and clinical trial design to compare the survival benefit of two arms consider a randomized clinical trial with a planned sample size n1 using a two-sided log-rank test if the hypothesis test indicates no significant survival difference between the two groups under the significance level  but the trial decides to continue to enroll more patients up to a larger sample size n2 this would inflate the overall type i error of the trial any adjustment to the sample size during the trial should be planned and evaluated in advance to maintain the overall type i error ratelet z1 and z2 denote the log-rank test statistics with sample sizes n1 and n2 respectively it holds that under the null hypothesis 1617 z1 and z2 jointly follow a multivariate normal distributiond1  dn1 and d2  dn2 are the expected numbers of events with sample sizes n1 and n2 and d is the proportion of patients experiencing the event thus the overall type i error rate  overall with the significance level  is is the 1  th quantile of the standard normal distributionfor clinical studies with a survival end point we are interested in the distribution of event time t in general patients will eventually experience the event with a long enough follow-up although the exact event time might not be observed due to censoring however for some diseases with long-term survivors it may happen that the event will never occur in a fraction of subjects ie the event time for cured subjects is infinity 18-21 under this situation patients can be divided into two groups the terminal or cure group the specified event would never occur and the nonterminal group the specified event would occur but possibly censored due to the end time of the study thus the distribution of the event time t has a point probability mass  at  is the group label taking a value of 1 if the individual is in the terminal group and 0 otherwise   p  1  pt   is the terminal rate and t follows a proper distribution with pt    1 for the covid-19 trials 1213 the cumulative incidence curve of t can be expressed byft and ft are the cumulative distribution functions of t and t respectively note that pt    1    1restricted mean survival time rmst 1622-26 is an alternative measure for the mean survival time that is not estimable due to the presence of censoring the rmst is equal to the expectation of the minimum value of event time t and the specified time point  which can be calculated as the area under the survival curve from 0 to  it can be estimated by the area under the kaplan-meier survival curve which has gained enormous popularity due to its robustness featurealthough the hr is the most popular statistic to quantify the survival difference in randomized clinical trials it is no longer an interpretable quantity if the proportional hazards ph assumption is violated 25 by contrast the rmst has the advantages of being nonparametric and model-free yet carrying clinically meaningful interpretations given the prespecified time point  the estimate of the rmst difference between two groups can be interpreted as the extra survival gain on average during the time  follow-up periodclinical trials during the epidemic of an infectious disease might fail to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients if the outbreak can be quickly controlled 27 however early termination of a clinical trial would inevitably lead to loss of power and thus unconvincing findings based on the collected data the bootstrap method can be used to predict what would happen if the trial had continued to reach the desired sample size let n denote the desired sample size and n0 n0  n the actual number of patients enrolled the statistic of interest prediction can be conducted under either conditional or unconditional schemes the unconditional prediction draws n samples sampling with replacement from the original data with n0 observations while the conditional prediction draws n  n0 samples from the original n0 observations and keeps the original n0 samples intact by repeating the sampling procedure for a large number of times one can estimate the predicted mean and the corresponding confidence interval for the statistic of interest if the trial had continued to reach the sample size of nin the original analysis of cao et al 12 the time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28 and failure to reach clinical improvement or death before day 28 were considered as right-censored at day 28 in contrast to the usual survival analysis where death or a bad event such as disease progression is used as the event of interest a good event clinical improvement was adopted as the end point in this trial as a result the shorter time to reach clinical improvement the better cao et al 12 concluded no benefit of using the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond the standard care with an hr of 124 95 ci 090-172we carried out an in-depth and comprehensive investigation of the trial design in cao et al 12 and identified several key issues with the trial that might have hindered its success first the unplanned sample size increment from 160 to 199 would inflate the type i error rate for this trial we have n1160 n2199 d075 d1  160  075  120 d2  199  075  14925 and based on equation 2 overall071 when the nominal significance level is set as 05 that is the false-positive rate for this trial increased as high as 71 in contrast to the nominal level of 5 any sample size alteration or re-estimation should be planned in advance to control the type i error rate and maintain the integrity of a trial when the sample size reached 199 the trial was halted for enrollment because of the availability of another treatment remdesivir such termination of a trial was again unplanned and immature if there were not another agent available would the trial continue recruitment interestingly the remdesivir trial by wang et al 13 the same group of investigators as the lopinavir-ritonavir trial started 3 days later after the lopinavir-ritonavir trial was terminatedin terms of the primary end point clinical improvement using two-level increment on a seven-category ordinal scale from baseline is ad hoc due to uneven clinical differences between adjacent scales for example it is ambiguous whether the status of a patient changing from point 5 to point 3 is equivalent to that of changing from point 6 to point 4 in addition live discharge from the hospital may occur from point 3 to point 2 or point 4 to point 2 which cannot be considered equivalent either thus choosing 2-point improvement on the clinical outcome scale is not a precise end point which ignores the 1-point improvement and the difference between 2-point and 3-point improvement instead we recommend death as a single and clean end point for such trials given the mortality rate was not low with patients who were hospitalized with severe covid-19 192 in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 250 in the standard care groupthe original analysis 12 treated death before day 28 as right-censored at day 28 no matter when death had occurred this may cause ambiguity because it cannot distinguish the situations where all deaths in one group occurred earlier while those in the other group occurred later as death is a terminal event a terminal or cure rate model would be more appropriate for analysis of such data a terminal rate model can be viewed as the counterpart of the traditional mixture cure rate model 18-21 which can be developed by slight modifications as death is a terminal event patients who died during the 28-day follow-up period would never reach the clinical improvement ie the time to clinical improvement was infinity denoted as  death can also be viewed as a competing risk for clinical improvementthe upper panel of table 1 shows that there was neither any significant difference in the terminal rates between the lopinavir-ritonavir and standard care groups or in the hr after excluding the terminal subjects who would eventually be absorbed in the death state from the mixture terminal rate model in particular the terminal rates including observed deaths as well as unobserved deaths that would occur after day 28 but were censored at day 28 were 2117 for the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 2991 for the standard care group with p16 and the hr for nonterminal subjects was 105 95 ci 078-142 p74moreover the crossings of the cumulative event curves for the lopinavir-ritonavir and standard care groups at days 10 and 16 in the second figure of cao et al 12 imply possible violation of the ph assumption when the ph assumption is not satisfied the hr from a cox model 29 is not clinically meaningful as an alternative the area above the curve in the second figure of cao et al 12 or the area under the inverted curve as shown in our figure 1 referred to as the restricted mean time to improvement rmti can be used to quantify treatment effect that requires no assumption such as ph 1622-26 as a model-free quantity the rmti up to 28 days can be interpreted as the average time to reach improvement in 28 days for which the shorter is the better the 28-day rmti difference between the two groups was 167 days 95 ci 362 to 028 p09 in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant the 7-day and 14-day rmtis are also presented in the lower panel of table 1 where the 14-day rmti showed some promising results for lopinavir-ritonavir yet further confirmation is neededtables 2 and 3 show the numbers on mortality and clinical improvement by day 28 across the two treatment groups respectively we carried out chi-square tests or fisher exact tests if some of the cell counts were smaller than 5 to examine any association between the outcomes and treatments for table 2 with 23 cells there is no association with p53 and if combining deaths in both earlier and later stages this leads to 22 cells with p32 and odds ratio 071 95 ci 036-140 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had 071 times odds to die by day 28 in comparison to those in the standard care group for table 3 with 24 cells there is no association with p11 and if combining all clinical improvement cases this leads to 22 cells with p53 and odds ratio 124 95 ci 064-240 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had 124 times odds to achieve clinical improvement by day 28 in comparison to those in the standard care group however none of the results are statistically significantwang et al 13 reported a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled remdesivir trial for patients with severe covid-19 based on an adjusted six-point ordinal scale of clinical status the primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as a 2-level decline from randomization similar to that in cao et al 12 in fact the two trials were conducted by the same group of investigators for which the shorter is the better patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir interferons and corticosteroids the hr between the remdesivir and placebo groups was 123 95 ci 087-175 indicating no significant difference overall 237 eligible patients were enrolled with 158 patients assigned to the remdesivir group and 78 patients to the placebo group under the intent-to-treat itt scheme the trial was stopped early and thus failed to reach the designated sample size 453 due to a lack of eligible patientssimilar to the trial by cao et al 12 deaths before day 28 were treated as right-censored observations at day 28 regardless of the actual occurrence time of deaths in wang et al 13 moreover a clinical improvement might not be observed due to death ie death is a terminal event and thus the terminal or cure rate model introduced earlier should be recommended for the survival analysis rather than the standard cox modelthe upper panel of table 4 indicates no significant difference in the terminal rates between the remdesivir and placebo groups in particular the terminal rates were 3149 for the remdesivir group and 4071 for the placebo group with p19 with the terminal subjects excluded the hr from the mixture terminal rate model was 092 95 ci 063-135 p67 which also showed no significant difference between the two groupsdue to the competing risk from death the end point might not be observed and thus the standard hazard concept is ambiguous and the hr does not have a meaningful interpretation anymore 30 in the second figure in wang et al 13 the curve for the cumulative improvement event of remdesivir is uniformly higher than that of the control indicating patients with remdesivir reached improvement faster than those in the control group the area above the cumulative incidence curve or equivalently the area under the survival curve up to 28 days in our figure 2 would be a reasonable quantity for evaluating the treatment efficacy using the reconstructed data from the second figure in wang et al 13 the rmti evaluated at day 28 was 2042 95 ci 1926-2157 days for the remdesivir group and 2131 95 ci 1973-2288 days for the placebo group as shown in the lower panel of table 4 the difference in rmtis was 089 days 95 ci 284 to 106 numerically favoring remdesivir but not statistically significant it can be interpreted that patients treated by remdesivir on average had an extra 089 days of improvement during the 28-day follow-up compared with those in the placebo group the 7-day and 14-day rmtis are also presented in the lower panel of table 4 and neither showed statistically significant resultsthe trial was terminated without reaching the originally planned sample size 453 due to a lack of eligible patients with only 236 patients in the itt analysis the estimated hr was 123 95 ci 087-175 numerically favoring remdesivir which might not be reliable due to the underpowered study using the bootstrap method we can predict what would happen if the trial had continued to reach the full sample size or double the planned sample size table 5 shows both the unconditional and conditional predictions of the hr similar to sample size re-estimation using conditional power 31 in a two-stage design if the trial could have reached the designated sample size the hr from the conditional prediction shows the significant treatment effect of remdesivir with p02 and if the trial had enrolled twice of the target sample size both conditional and unconditional approaches result in significant differences under the 5 significance level thus a larger sample size may be needed to show the significant difference between remdesivir and placebobeigel et al 14 presented a preliminary report of the nct04280705 trial which is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement this trial enrolled 1059 patients 538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo the primary end point of the original analysis was the recovery time defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only the median recovery time of the remdesivir group was 11 95 ci 9-12 days and that of the placebo group was 15 95 ci 13-19 days the rate ratio of recovery for remdesivir vs placebo was 132 95 ci 112-155 p001 which demonstrated the superiority of remdesivir in terms of the hr for death there was no significant difference between the remdesivir and placebo groups with an hr of 070 95 ci 047-104the remdesivir trial of beigel et al 14 is essential to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir as it had a large sample size of 1059 patients under a well-designed randomized controlled trial scheme in terms of the data analysis beigel et al 14 only reported the median recovery time without a p value from the second figure in beigel et al 14 the kaplan-meier curves of cumulative recoveries are initially intertwined and then diverge so other percentiles of the time to recovery would provide more information on the efficacy of remdesivir meanwhile a global and robust measurement the restricted mean time to recovery rmtr can help to quantify the treatment efficacy in a more comprehensive way 1622-26the upper panel of table 6 presents the rmtrs up to day 30 for both the remdesivir and placebo groups the rmtrs were 145 days and 172 days for remdesivir and placebo respectively indicating that patients with remdesivir on average had 27-day gains of recovery with 30-day follow-ups the difference in rmtrs was statistically significant with p001 demonstrating the superiority of remdesivir this is consistent with the original analysis in terms of the rate ratio of recovery 14 meanwhile in the bottom panel of table 6 more percentiles of the time to recovery were reported with p values the early difference for remdesivir vs placebo in the recovery time at the 25th percentile was 1 95 ci 3 to 0 p65 which was not statistically significant however the differences manifested to be statistically significant later for example the 30th to 60th percentiles of the recovery time in the remdesivir group were all significantly shorter than those in the placebo group it is reasonable for the treatment to take effect after a certain length of follow-upwhen designing and conducting a clinical trial for new treatment particularly for the covid-19 pandemic without knowing much about the clinical outcomes many things can go wrong if the design is not well thought out the trial is not carefully conducted following the protocol or the analysis is not properly carried out critical issues with such trials include but are not limited to the end point selection the type i error rate control double blinding or open label early termination of a trial the validity of the ph assumption in a cox model and assumptions for statistical tests and models in contrast to searching for a needle in a haystack the trial design should be more targeted focused and tailored for specific needs of patients with covid-19 and particular disease characteristics and severities 32given the emergency and the fast spread of the coronavirus around the world it is crucial to design the right clinical trial and accelerate the development of a new treatment with the high speed of enrollment and urgency of the trial outcome it appears to be difficult to carry out any adaptation during the trial conduct the trial outcomes unfold so fast that any adaptation may not be able to catch up with the speed of recruitmentas a summary our recommendations for covid-19 trials arealthough adaptive design has gained much popularity and is playing an increasingly important role in clinical trials particularly in oncology the advantages of adaptive design may be mitigated to a large extent under such a fast patient enrollment because the impact of any adaptation may be too slow to manifest before the trial is completed in such cases the consort consolidated standards of reporting trials statement 3334 can provide a general guideline for the trial design and conduct as a result our recommendations follow the gold standard scheme of conventional trial design without much adaptation ingredient which may help investigators to discriminate different treatments and identify the effective ones in an efficient wayin december 2019 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 occurred in wuhan hubei province and then unfolded in china and all over the world 1 the novel coronavirus has been a serious threat to public health 2 china has taken strict measures such as quarantine social-distancing suspicious isolation community surveillance to restrain covid-19 outbreak by late february however heilongjiang has now become the province with most diagnosed patients in china ie even worse than hubei province massive imported cases emerge and continue to increase specifically a recent super spreader or imported escaper in heilongjiang province has led to tens of diagnosed or asymptomatic cases 3 therefore evaluating the epidemic of covid-19 in heilongjiang province may help provide effective strategies to restrict covid-19 transmissionrecently many mathematical models have been constructed to investigate the epidemic of covid-19 some models have made modifications based on the conventional seir model 4 and concluded that strictly controlled interventions are critically important to impede covid-19 outbreak 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 several other model instead established a stochastic transition model to evaluate the transmission of covid-19 and also emphasized the necessity of interventions such as social-distancing isolation and quarantine 1213 meanwhile asymptomatic patients are covert cases which represent a serious threat to public health 14 a few models have been developed to evaluate the role of coronavirus transmission based on asymptomatic cases 111516 however all these models have ignored the covid-19 transmission from bats and unknown hosts a recently proposed novel model has characterized these interactions among bats unknown hosts and people in details 17 they estimated the basic reproduction number r0 to be 24829 and indicated that model is locally asymptotically stable if r0  1 17 these important models have greatly improved our understanding about the epidemic of covid-19in current work we developed a mathematical model to characterize imported escaper and asymptomatic patients we trained our model based on covid-19 epidemic in heilongjiang province from january 23 to march 25 by which the last confirmed patient was cured in heilongjiang province using this model we performed stochastic simulations and found that partial relief in strictly controlled interventions may contribute to the occurrence of diagnosed patients recently from april 9 to april 19 provided that there is only one imported patient without surveillance 3 meanwhile we predicted that there is still an unidentified pool of asymptomatic patients we suggested that strict or mild interventions should still be implemented to restrain a potential covid-19 outbreakthe number of experimentally confirmed patients and curedrecovered cases january 23 to april 19 was obtained from health commission of heilongjiang province httpwsjkwhljgovcn table s1 note that only domestic cases epidemiologically associated with the super spreader between april 9 and april 19 were recorded and

 since the best fit for initial asymptotic population is 1 0042736 we set initial value for a to be 0 since a should be an integer we note that the parameter n in the best fit set was 102545 suggesting that the threshold behavior in recovery rate has relatively low cooperativityparameters were estimated by potterswheel using a trust-region method 21 a 2 criteria was used for model identification 2n1 n is the number of data points 21 we did not incorporate death similar to recent assumptions 1322the -leap method was used for stochastic simulation 23 ordinary differential equations odes were numerically solved using ode23s in matlab r2018b the ksdensity function in matlab was used for kernel estimationthe model was first trained with epidemic data from heilongjiang province using a reasonable initial guess we performed unbiased parameter fitting by sampling parameters in logarithmic scale totally 400 sets the top 200 fits were harvested we noted that fitted initial values from 200 top fits for asymptomatic patient number a approximated zero with mean value 01 and therefore the initial value a for is set to be 0 the best fit was shown for infected and recovered patients by march 25 figure 1
a notably the fitted i i1 2 3 values were to the order of 1010 to 109 suggesting that strong interventions were implemented to restrain mutual contacts table 1 meanwhile n is around 1 102545 suggesting that the cooperativity was neglectable the best fit parameter set was shown in table 1 we further estimated a dynamic reproduction number based on ordinary differential equations 24 the results showed that the reproduction number initially reached 50692 and then quickly dropped below 1 by feb 14 and finally reached 08702 figure s1 therefore our model could faithfully match the epidemic data in heilongjiang province and found that continuously strict measures indeed impeded the covid-19 transmissionwe then performed stochastic simulations using -leap method 23 since mutual contacts among different populations act as potential risk factors to covid-19 outbreak 25 all i i1 2 3 values were multiplied by a contact factor f i fi i1 2 3 therefore f1 indicated strongly controlled interventions as implemented between late january and mid-march while f1 represented mild or relieved interventions f1 was associated with strongly weakened or no interventions the imported escaper or super spreader the super spreader here means that all recently confirmed patients can be associated with this super spreader in an ongoing epidemiological study arrived in heilongjiang province at march 19 and was then subject to home quarantine 3 therefore the number of infected patients was increased by 1 at march 19 in the stochastic model however the home quarantine was failed as reported possibly owing to accidental egress by escalator or stairs 3 we modeled this by increasing f from 3 to 8 and then performed stochastic simulations results suggested that even a moderate relief would not lead to the reported local outbreak f34 and 5 figure 2
a increasing f to 6-8 however will result in possible matches between stochastic simulations and reported epidemic data black dots epidemic data colored curves stochastic simulations figure 2a the median values from 500 stochastic runs were shown for increasing f values blue curves figure 2b the shaded areas denote 25 and 75 quartiles therefore we predicted that the mutual contacts for the super spreader was significantly elevated to around 7we further matched our simulations to the reported asymptomatic patients setting f7 stochastic simulation could match the epidemic data figure 2 however we noted a large gap between the simulated number of asymptomatic patients to the reported cases f7 figure 3
a since asymptomatic patients usually do not seek medical tests owing to lack of symptoms the reported number of asymptomatic cases may be lower than the actual number figure 3a 18 19 20 the underestimation was significant for f6 or f7 on april 19 dashed line the mean value figure 3b the discrepancy seemed to grow if intervention strength was not altered figure 3b these simulations implied that the unidentified asymptomatic patients might be another serious concern since the asymptomatic cases can also be contagious 18 19 20since the confirmed patients have undergone an ongoing increase we then evaluated the effect of establishment of strict interventions since april 20 black dot figure 4
a strict interventions were implemented f1 or 2 since april 20 we measured the time to peak and the recovery time since april 9 at which the first reported domestic patient occurs in heilongjiang province 26 we found that roughly 33 days were used to reach the peak for f1 whereas for f2 the duration was increased to 53 days figure 4b and 4c left 80 days were required for total recovery if f1 whereas about 139 days were needed for f2 figure 4b and 4c right therefore these simulations suggested implementation of strict interventions is strongly required to impede a potential outbreakin this study we constructed a modified model which incorporated threshold behavior in recovery rate and asymptomatic patients with significant difference to seir model 4 however ongoing importation into china especially in heilongjiang province has been a serious threat recently furthermore the asymptomatic patients are not easily identified owing to lack of obvious symptoms 20 we estimated the influence of asymptomatic patients based on a data-driven model from heilongjiang province we anticipated that an area- or province-specific model may help unravel the underlying features of covid-19 epidemicfrom simulation we found that even one imported patient or super spreader reported recently can lead to up to  40 infected patients and unpredictable pool of asymptomatic patients till april 19 3 we anticipated that the relaxed home quarantine for this imported patient 3 is unsuccessful and has initiated a local outbreak potentially simulation suggested that the mutual contacts from the relaxed home quarantine might possibly increase to f7 compared with f1 for strictly controlled interventions the occurrence of the imported escaper might be ascribed to the significantly longer latent period 2 the weakened surveillance for covid-19 inpatient transfer in specific hospitals and the murky mismanagement for covid-19 tests 3 all these deficiencies may possibly lead to a secondary blockage of some hospitals and communities for haerbin city in heilongjiang province more seriously the associated pool of asymptomatic patients was underestimated from official report since asymptomatic patients are also contagious the potential impact of these covert cases should attract extensive attention as least about one month is still required if strict measures are immediately implemented therefore the imported escaper argues for further epidemiological investigations as well as strongly controlled interventions as more data are available our model could be used for analyzing these novel epidemic dataliu et al recently constructed a model with asymptomatic patients 11 however asymptomatic populations in their model will eventually become diagnosedconfirmed patients with clear symptoms and are more likely to be pre-symptomatic 14 which is in stark contrast to recent definition ie asymptomatic patients were those who never develop symptoms 18 19 20we modeled the covid-19 epidemic induced by one imported patient without strict quarantine lessons from the emerging diagnosed patients recently in heilongjiang province since april 9 should catch attention as they are epidemiologically associated with this imported escaper furthermore we recommended that the strict measures such as isolation home or centralized quarantine should be re-established especially in haerbin city of heilongjiang province to lower the risk of a potentially secondary outbreak finally our model could also be applied elsewhere with adjusted parameters to monitor covid-19 epidemicnot required

infection in children worldwide 1 with the key
risk group being young infants 2 no vaccine is
currently available for this age group development of alternative control strategies
depends on the mechanisms of transmission which are intrinsically related to viral shedding
3 4
detailed data on shedding in individuals in relation to age infecting subtype groups a or
b infection severity and gender would help in identifying the source of infant infection
such data from the natural setting unaffected by sampling bias are limited and absent in
resource-poor settings additionally this study assesses the impact of the presence of
other respiratory viruses prior to or concomitant with rsv on rsv infection duration any
interaction might be mediated through direct interference or host immune and physiological
responses these possibilities have received very little attention in the literatureprevious studies on rsv shedding have been mainly in the hospital setting limiting the
generalizability of the results 3 5 6 hospital
studies are biased to young children with severe rsv disease and fail to precisely establish
the start and often the end of shedding particularly when symptoms do not coincide with
virus shedding which is common for rsv 6
community-based studies are likely to provide a more complete representation of the rsv
shedding patterns such studies require frequent nasopharyngeal swabbing regardless of
symptoms and use of sensitive molecular techniques for viral testing in order to minimize
the likelihood of missing infection episodes especially in older age groupsthe current prospective study utilizes the above approach with intensive sampling every
34 days molecular testing and follow-up of individuals of all ages for one complete rsv
season in a rural kenyan community 7 this
provides for more realistic estimates on duration of and influencing factors on rsv shedding
which are required in designing rsv prevention strategies and to better understand the
impact of vaccination on rsv transmission dynamicsnps were collected and tested for rsv groups a and b and other respiratory viruses
adenoviruses rhinoviruses and human coronaviruses nl63 229e oc43 using real-time
multiplex pcr as described previously 7 in
order to establish the genetic similarity of the rsv strains in suspected repeat
infections the ectodomains of the rsv attachment g protein gene were sequenced and
analysed phylogenetically 9the authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical
standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation
and with the helsinki declaration of 1975 as revised in 2008data were analysed using stata version 112 statacorp usa the infection data were
interval-censored and three possible durations of viral shedding were estimated ie
minimum midpoint and maximum as described in the supplementary online material and shown
in figure s1 an rsv infection episode was defined as the period within which an
individual provided specimens which were pcr positive for the same infecting rsv group
with no more than 14 days separating any two positive samples episodes where the first
sample was positive for both rsv groups a and b counted as one infection episode episodes
where no samples were collected for 7 days before or after the infection episode
were considered left- or right-censored respectively symptomatic infection was defined
as the presence of one or more of the following symptoms cough nasal dischargeblocked
nose or difficulty in breathing at any time during the infection episode co-infection
was assigned when within the rsv episode any sample was pcr positive for another virus
ie coronavirus rhinovirus or adenovirus presence of these viruses in the samples
collected in the period of 14 days prior to start of rsv episodes was also defined
household outbreak was defined as a period within which more than one individual episodes
occurred in members of the same household without an interval of 14 days in which a
pcr-positive specimen was absent from the household the proportion of the household
members infected during household outbreaks measured the intensity of the outbreakcox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors influencing the rate of
loss of virus detection hereafter referred as the recovery rate the effect of
left-censoring was accounted for in the multivariate model by including a dummy variable
or by excluding the left-censored episodesof the 493 individuals in the 47 households followed 179 363 had at least one rsv

54 days with median of 28 days for the 17 homologous infections sequencing of the rsv g
gene was successful in 10 59 of the 18 possible pairs of samples one individual had
three suspected rsv episodes the failure to sequence was mainly in samples with a pcr
cycle threshold ct value of  280 an indicator of low viral load
only one of the successfully sequenced paired samples showed nucleotide differences 13

stop codon position the episodes in this individual id no 1803 in fig 2 occurred 54 days apart for the purposes of estimation of the

estimates were 86 days and 140 days respectively the duration of shedding based on the
most realistic estimate decreased with age 18 days in infants and 9 days in adults aged
15 years symptomatic infections on average had longer virus shedding of 135 days
compared to 78 days in asymptomatic episodes the presented average durations of virus
shedding are longer than published estimates of 67 days 4 3474 days 10 39 days 11 and 45 days 12 which could be attributed to differences in study methods the present study was
informed by critical review of the previous studies and it incorporated frequent sampling
regardless of symptoms and screening by highly sensitive pcr methods the specimen
collection procedure was acceptable recording a good compliance across all ages 7 13 the use
of the sensitive viral detection method pcr results is likely to result in longer
estimates of sheddinga community study nested within a birth cohort in coastal kenya targeting symptomatic rsv
infections by okiro and colleagues reported a mean duration of shedding of 45 days 12 our corresponding estimate in symptomatic cases
was 135 days in a subset of the children whose start of symptoms could be established from
the clinic records the okiro et al study reported a longer duration of
77 days 12 given that rsv shedding has been
reported to start before illness 6 the actual
duration in the symptomatic children would have been an underestimate and our estimate of
135 days is likely to be more accurate a rochester family study in the usa with similar
design as the present study collecting samples every 34 days regardless of symptoms
reported lower estimates of duration of shedding of 3474 days 10 the okiro et al and rochester study used the
immunofluorescent antibody test ifat and culture respectively which are less sensitive
methods 14 as a counter argument it is not
known to what degree pcr positivity equates with shedding of viable and infectious virus
thus while the molecular methods might be more sensitive the resultant increase in
duration of shedding over more traditional methods such as culture which directly measures
viral infectivity may not necessarily translate to increased period of infectivity further
work relating virus infectiousness and detectability is warranted in the okiro et
al study sampling started when participants were symptomatic and stopped at the
first negative follow-up sample the present study revealed instances where negative samples
arose within rsv infection episodes even though this observation raises again questions
on the relationship between infectivity and shedding duration accounting for periods of
rsv-negative samples would still result to longer shedding duration compared to previous
estimates alternative estimation of the shedding patterns by calculating the area under the
ct viral load curve would have some additional advantages and will be
explored in futureprolonged shedders of  3 weeks duration have been reported 6 10 in the present study
24 134 episodes in the 179 infected individuals involved shedding rsv for 3
weeks most 22 917 of these episodes were symptomatic and occurred in young children
median age 147 months individuals with compromised immunity have been known to shed rsv
for longer 15 but participants in the current
study were not tested for hiv the hiv prevalence in women and men aged 1549 years in
coastal kenya was 42 according to the kenyan demographic and health survey of 20082009
16 in settings where hiv prevalence is high
the effect of the poor viral clearance might influence the temporal epidemiology as was
observed in south africa 15 there was no obvious
malnourished participant in the study cohort based on mid-upper arm circumference
measurementsmore than two rsv episodes were observed in 24 134 individuals on average the
episodes were 4 weeks apart most 708 of the suspected repeat infections were with
homologous rsv group sequencing of the most variable region of the rsv genome the
ectodomain of the g gene did not greatly assist in resolving the infection episodes as most
910 had identical sequences it is thus not clear whether the two phases of rsv
shedding were repeat infections with the same variant or were persistent infection with
periods of low viral load that was undetectable by the methods used using post-mortem lung
tissue from infants rsv rna has been detected even in children dying during inter-epidemic
periods suggesting the persistence of rsv in the lungs of these infants 17 similar observations have been made in
experimental infection with rsv 18 and measles
viruses 19 the lack of variability in the virus
identified in the two phases of infections suggests virus mutation might not be the primary
mechanism for virus persistence or re-infection regardless of whether it is re-infection
within a short period or persistence the observation represents an interesting phenomenon
of rsv which has potential importance on our existing view of acute rsv infection the
development of immunity and effects on viral transmissionthe age of the individual infection severity detection of other viruses before and during
the rsv infection and presence of concurrent rsv infections in the same household were all
associated with virus shedding the rate of recovery increased with increasing age with
individuals in 14 years 515 years and 15 years age groups recovering 198 182 and 197
times faster than the infants respectively the rochester family study reported similar
findings where longer shedding was observed for children aged 2 years compared to
those aged 216 years 9 vs 4 days the okiro et al
study did not find any association with age but found that children with previous rsv
infection using the assumption that those aged 3 years were by default experiencing
a repeat infection had 137 times faster rate of recovery compared to those without a
history of infection 12 in the present study a
subsequent rsv infection during the same rsv season was not significantly associated with
reduced shedding duration but such infections were few n  24 the
current study is for one epidemic only so age must act as a proxy of exposure to rsv in
earlier epidemics prolonged shedding enhances the possibility of person-to-person
transmission and makes young children a potential source of community spread of infection
both of which have important implications in the control and prevention of rsv infectiona study involving 23 hospitalized children aged 2 years with sampling extended
beyond discharge reported an association of duration of shedding and symptom severity 4 children with lower respiratory tract infection shed
for longer than those with upper respiratory tract infection 84 vs 14
days duration of shedding may be related to severity of disease but evidence is
controversial on the link between disease severity and viral load 5 2022an interaction between detection of other viruses ie coronavirus rhinovirus
adenovirus in the nasopharynx and rate of recovery from rsv infection was observed
recovery from a viral infection just prior to rsv might have led to up-regulation of innate
viral immunity or non-specific cross-reactivity that reduced subsequent rsv shedding
presence of co-infections might be a marker of low immunity associated with poor viral
clearance rsv episodes with concurrent spread in the household were associated with
increased recovery rate however any conclusions other than association cannot be made
since the extended duration of shedding increases the risk of both co-infection with other
viruses and multiple rsv infections in the household a different estimation framework is
required to untangle these resultsthe problems of ascertainment and analysis ie censoring and test sensitivity are not
completely eliminated by the careful study design but did not seem to affect the
association of the examined factors with virus shedding supplementary table s1 short rsv
infections occurring between specimen collections particularly in older individuals might
have been missed but this is likely to be at random and bias hazard ratios towards nullin conclusion this study defines rsv shedding patterns in the natural setting with
significant potential for improved understanding of the spread of this important virus and
with relevance the design of control programmesanosmia and hyposmia the inability to perceive smells and a reduced or altered ability respectively as well as taste perception alterations are occasionally associated with respiratory virus infection including the wellknown family of coronavirus

the main goal of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of smelltaste disorders in a large covid19 positive population composed of patients who were either asymptomatic or presenting mild or moderate symptomsour findings 66 and 654 respectively without gender differences are similar to those of yan et al about a smaller sample of 59 positive patients
10
 a recent european multicenter study reported higher percentages both for smell and taste disorders with a female prevalence
12

since only one study by mao et al referred to the prevalence of chemosensory impairment in asiatic covid19 population 5
9
 our data seem to corroborate the hypothesis by lechien et al that western positive patients usa and europe may be more subject to the development of olfactory and gustatory disorders
12

the majority of patients in this study complained of complete anosmiaageusia confirming the observation that covid19 related impairment tends to induce a severe olfactory and gustatory dysfunction
10
 
12

of particular interest is the analysis of the timing of anosmia the loss of smell was noted in 54 prior to diagnosis and appeared as the first symptom in 13 of cases recent onset of olfactory disorders may drive the physicians to treat these patients as possible covid19 positive adequate precautions for the health care practitioners pcrtesting and home selfisolation are crucial measures to avoid that such patients continuing to accidentally act as vectors of the diseaseanother pivotal issue of the research regards the recovery of olfactory and gustatory functions 495 of patients reported a full regaining of both senses after 14 days since the beginning of the symptoms and this percentage improved to 629 at time of interview 23 days median range 1531 with a median recovery time of 10 days obviously even if our follow up is longer than other reports
10

12
 it remains too short to give a conclusive interpretation regarding the prognosisalthough the exact mechanism with which sarscov2 could impair smell and taste has not been definitively determined two hypotheses appear to be plausible damage to the olfactory epithelium due to cell expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors which act as a binding point for the virus
16
 or a direct assault on the olfactory neurons
17
 the relatively rapid and spontaneous recovery of most patients in the current and in other studies tends to suggest an epithelial based pathogenesis given the capability for the epithelium to quickly restore its functions after damage
10
 
11
 
12

according to some authors the presence of 15 variants of the ace2 gene explains many ace2 polymorphisms and differences in expression between european and asian populations this finding could be a cue to investigate if different patterns may influence susceptibility and clinical features of covid19 infection
18

the current study presents some limitations shared by all similar researches first of all the patients did not undergo nasal endoscopy specific imaging or objective smell assessment these examinations would contribute to a better understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and to define some prognostic factors about the functional recoverysecond the evaluation tool was a selfreported smell and taste score it has been previously demonstrated that subjective evaluation of sense of smell is quite specific but less sensitive than objective testing
19
 moreover the survey was rapidly developed by the authors with the aim of collecting and sharing the most possible data in the shortest time after such emergency contingency additional validation is neededthird even if our population is quite numerous the sampling time was short and limited to a single center future studies on larger samples can help to clarify the prevalence of anosmiaageusia in covid19 patientslastly no patients in this study received specific treatment for olfactory or gustatory loss currently no medical treatment has proved to be highly effective in postviral anosmia
20
 
21
 
22
 the potential risks of immunosuppression with the use of oral and some topical steroids also need to be borne in mind consequently we agree with most authors who recommend against specific therapy

a different approach could be applied to those patients with persistent olfactory disorders after complete recovery from covid19 and an exhaustive smelltaste assessment in any case further studies are needed in order to investigate potential benefits of treatment in selected casesbeyond the limitation this is one of the first studies to provide the prevalence the onset time the severity and the recovery time of covid19 related smell and taste disorders the followup time is acceptable and the sample is various and quite representative novara indeed is a small city 100 000 inhabitants near the border with the lombardy region the epicenter of the italian covid19 outbreak at accrual timemarch 30ththe positive patients in the town were almost 800 of which 355 were enrolled in the current researchthe current study strongly confirms the high prevalence of olfactory and gustatory disorders in covid19 infection

the health care delivery system this fourth phase of a sudden onset disaster cycle has been planned and exercised even studied after hurricanes floods and typhoons there is no model of health care delivery system recovery after a pandemicthe impact of the coronavirus disease2019 covid-19 pandemic response phase has already exceeded the capacity and capabilities of most city regional state and national health care delivery systems there are clinical non-clinical and support staff who are assigned to attend non-covid-19 patients in the acute care setting but the overwhelming majority of staff has been consumed in acute care hospitals for the covid-19 response some have fallen ill or have had to be quarantined the breadth of the toll of a prolonged acute covid-19 pandemic response on the well-being and mental health of staff has yet to be appreciated and addressed non-acute care staff or acute care staff who typically do not attend to pneumonia or sepsis patients with skills that can be adapted to the acute covid-19 care environment have been redeployed from their usual practice settings with just-in-time educationthroughout the world government restrictions have canceled postponed or limited by priority primary and specialty care visits additionally the fear of acquiring the severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus 2 sars-ncov-2 has kept people away from their health care providers1 in the united states this has reduced health care system revenue specifically the decrease in elective surgical endoscopy and other procedures across the united states and in most other countries there has been a marked decrease in emergency department visits and subsequent admissions that have decreased hospitals bed census to open space for covid-19 patients during this slow developing pandemic mass casualty incident this has also decreased revenue2 hospitals have been adhering to the mass casualty surge capacity theory to limit or postpone elective surgery and imaging services and to also free in-patient beds and imaging services for the acute covid-19 response this has also decreased revenue in the united states there is a growing number of health care delivery systems that have furloughed clinical non-clinical and support staff deemed not essential to the acute covid-19 response to reduce the impact of projected future revenue loss3 the staff affected by this health care delivery service disruption remain available to return to their duty stationsnon-acute covid-19 staff redeployed will likely remain redeployed as the duration of acute care can range from days to weeks post-acute care covid-19 patients who are too weak to go home or require oxygen who have not been cleared of the sars-ncov-2 virus have few options to transfer out of an acute care bed they may need physical therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation the spoke-and-hub system is functioning in most health care delivery systems with those acute covid-19 patients who require a ventilator and other intensive care unit management being transferred to tertiary level acute care or alternative site hospitals the reverse triage process is less functional in most health care delivery systems where the post-acute care covid-19 patients are transferred to acute care hospitals that can manage these patients staff and stuff will still have to be devoted to these facilitiesstuff has been consumed at an alarming rate with materials taken from non-acute clinical settings their storage and their contracted-to-be-delivered materials have been redistributed to the acute covid-19 hospitals supply lines have been disrupted from raw materials to finished goods with industries retooled to devote their output for the acute covid-19 response alternative covid-19 care sites have been adapted to function for an extended period of time in non-acute care structures wards clinics offices displacing this clinical office and treatment space for an unknown period of time the collective attention of health care administrators has been focused on their systems acute pandemic responsethe acute covid-19 pandemic will persist until a vaccine has been created properly tested without political exigency and administered to create sufficient population immunity there will be an untold and unpredictable number of short-term rises in patients with an acute covid-19 infection these will be mere ripples and will not approximate the spanish flu of 19181919 or modeled covid-19 projections due to the populations compliance with masking social distancing and hygiene the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic is comingthe second wave will comprise patients with chronic illness who have patiently waited to reschedule or schedule their primary or specialty care appointment to refill medications obtain durable medical equipment and undergo surveillance laboratory or imaging studies to gauge effectiveness of titrated therapy this will include patients who have waited and have symptoms signs and other indicators of a serious illness that requires a timely diagnosis to maximize effective treatment this will include the patients with mental illness or substance abuse who have had their outpatient treatment routines disrupted while doing their best to accept their individual family and community stress eventually these patients will need care and like the covid-19 response there will be an exponential curve of presentations and consequences of delayed care the second wave also there will be post-acute covid-19 patients with an unknown post-acute pathophysiology who will require longitudinal care some may require supplemental oxygen for extended periods with a new or adapted pulmonary rehabilitationthe current acute covid-19 health care delivery incident command system will remain in place albeit contracting and expanding in relationship to the ongoing local response guided by the runkle et al4 study from 2012 a secondary surge after a pandemic has parallels to that after a sudden onset disaster the time is now to stand up a recovery health care delivery system this would include the post-acute covid-19 patients who require ongoing care and the primary and specialty health care delivery system that has been canceled postponed or limited the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic will include the patients who have had their primary and specialty care delayed there are published post-acute sudden onset disaster response health care system studies after hurricanes typhoons floods tornadoes a superstorm tsunami and nuclear

time is of the essence to continue the pandemic disaster cycle with a comprehensive post-covid-19 health care delivery system recovery analysis plan and operation at the local regional and state levelsthe devastating marks left by infectious diseases on human race are much similar to that caused by famine and war 1 majority of the infectious diseases are caused by viruses bacteria or fungi coronaviruses are a family of viruses responsible for causing diseases ranging from mild infection to death causing diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars since the advent of the 21st century there has been a surge in the discovery of new coronaviruses such as sars co-v hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 etc 2 the detailed medical analysis on the death of a 60-year-old man in saudi arabia led to the discovery of a novel coronavirus 2 which was later coined as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers co-v the incubation period associated with the viral infection ranges from 2 to 14 days the mortality rate associated with mers co-v is over 30 3 mers co-v is a zoonotic virus wherein human beings may get infected due to direct or indirect contact with infected animals 4 camels have been identified as a carrier 5 it is believed that the mers-cov is transmitted to humans from camels through respiratory droplet saliva or consuming undercooked camel meat or milk using viral genome sequencing the zoonotic nature of the virus was confirmed 6 mers co-v rna was detected in nasal swab of infected camels and their antibodies were found in 70 of the positively tested camels 7 contact with infected people in healthcare facilities houses and communities have also contributed to the spread of the disease 8 9 10 11 healthcare facilities are the major source of nosocomial outbreak of the disease 12 studies conducted have reported that there is no pandemic risk associated with the disease acquired through contact with infected people 13 proper awareness of modes of transmission of the disease can help in preventing the spread of the infection several studies have been conducted to assess the knowledge of mers among various sections of the society 14 15 16 a recent study conducted throws light on the lack of knowledge of the general public regarding the probable epidemic nature of the disease 15according to the information provided by the world health organization who about 27 countries have reported cases on mers co-v infection since 2012 nearly 80 of the cases have been reported from the middle eastern country kingdom of saudi arabia acute respiratory problem along with fever cough or shortness of breath are the most common symptoms of mers co-v infection apart from the aforementioned health problems many people infected with the virus suffered from diarrhoea nausea or vomiting in a small fraction of cases people with infection showed very mild or no symptoms the mortality rate is comparatively high in people suffering from comorbidities 17 people suffering from kidney problems cancer diabetics respiratory problems etc are more likely to be severely infected by the virus 12rivers et al used poisson regression to identify the risk factors associated with death and severity of the disease they concluded that advancing age and pre-existing diseases were the main risk factors leading to death and severe infection 18 ahmed employed statistical methods to determine the predictors responsible for recovery from the disease after 3 and 30 days of onset of symptoms the study identified old age non-healthcare workers severe infection and hospital-acquired infection as the leading factors responsible for mortality 19al-turaiki et al used predictive models such as nave bayes and j48 to analyse mers data pertaining to saudi arabia 20 the recovery model generated indicates that the healthcare workers are most likely to recover from the infection in the case of non-healthcare workers pre-existing diseases hamper the recovery the authors also generated a stability model from which it can be inferred that in the case of people with pre-existing diseases symptoms and age turned out to be the significant factors in determining the severity of viral infection abdullah et al used classification methods such as support vector machine random forest and nave bayes to detect mers co-v infection the authors observed that people above 50 years had more chances of infection compared to the rest 21the studies on the trends associated with infectious diseases are broadly classified into computational mathematical and surveillance based methods 22 our paper aims at identifying the important factors which influence the recovery of mers co-v infected people in the kingdom of saudi arabia machine learning techniques and statistical analysis are employed for the purposethe data for analysis was taken from the control and command centre ministry of health website of the kingdom of saudi arabia mers co-v cases from january 2015 to april 2018 have been used in the study a total number of 983 mers cases were reported during this period although there has been a tremendous reduction in the number of new cases compared to the year 2014 until now the disease has not been brought under controlthe information gathered consisted of daily records based on new cases recovery cases and death cases the recovery and death cases were mapped with the new cases reported to gather more information regarding the patients infected with mers the unmatched patient records were eliminated and hence 836 patient records were used for analysis out of the 836 cases 52 patients were initially reported as dead hence those cases were also removed from the dataset and 784 cases were used in the study the description of the database used for research is shown in table 1
 the database analysed consists of 261 death casessupport vector machine is also known as hyperplane classifier as it strives to find a hyperplane which is capable of dividing the different classes of data with a relatively large margin it has the capability to learn independent of the number of features of the dataset svm with a radial kernel is used to perform the experimentsnaives bayes is based on the assumption that the factors of the dataset considered are in no way related to one another it is based on bayes theorem which computes the conditional probability of the classification result based on independent factors 23 conditional probability is computed as shown in eq 11pcxpxcpcpxwhere c denotes the target variable and x is the predictorconditional inference tree is a widely used tree-based classification technique it differs from rpart in the strategy adopted to select variables while splitting the tree rpart selects variable by maximizing information criterion while conditional inference tree selects variables which are statistically significantj48 generates c45 trees which are either pruned or unpruned 24 the decision tree method c45 is an extension of iterative dichotomiser 3 id3 the nodes are split based on the difference in entropy c45 is capable of handling both continuous and discrete attributeslogistic regression also known as logit regression is a classification method used to predict the value of a categorical variable it models the probability of the response belonging to a particular category logistic regression involves computing the log odds of an event which is considered equivalent to multiple linear regression function in this work binomial logistic regression was used because the outcome of the prediction belongs to any one of the two classes death or recoverythe important predictors associated with mers recovery was obtained by computing the variable importance associated with different machine learning methods by considering the entire data as the train data the graphical representation of the variable importance of factors corresponding to various methods are shown in fig 1
it is evident from various plots in fig 1 that the four most important factors associated with survival of mers co-v infected people are initial status of the disease istatus age pre-existing diseases predisease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not hcw statistical analysis such as univariate and multivariate logistic regression were also carried out to find the important factors associated with recovery from mers the estimate and p-values of the analysis are tabulated in table 2
the presence of asterisk next to the p-value in table 2 indicates that the attribute is significant the p-values of significant variables are visually encoded the significance codes less than 0001 between 0001 and 001 between 001 and 005 and between 005 and 01 are represented using the symbol    and  dot respectively in the aforementioned table estimate refers to the log of odds a negative value of estimate indicates that the variable has a negative impact on recovery and vice versa it can be inferred from univariate and multivariate analysis that all variables except symptoms and animal exposure are significant in determining the recovery of a patient multivariate analysis was again done by taking the top four significant variables obtained from the multivariate analysis performed earlier and the results are shown in table 3
it is evident from table 3 that all the four variables are highly significant with p-value less than 001 it can be inferred from table 3 that the most significant factor influencing recovery is the severity of the disease indicated by initial status the most important factors identified by the various machine learning methods are initial status healthcare worker or not age and pre-existing diseasesthe results of the important variables identified by machine learning models such as svm j48 naives bayes and ctree are consistent with the earlier studies 18 19 2025 the j48 decision tree developed by al-turaiki et al identified that pre-existing disease and whether the patient is a healthcare professional or not are the main factors influencing recovery 20 the study conducted based on mers infection in south korea identified age and comorbidities as vital factors in determining recovery 25on analysis of the data it has been observed that there is only a slight difference between the death rate in patients exposed to camels and patients not exposed to camels hence the feature animal exposure turned out to be an insignificant attribute however it is to be specially noted that nearly 80 of the recovered patients who had exposure to camels were initially in a stable condition this may have contributed immensely to recovery thereby making camel exposure as an insignificant factor nearly 10 of the mers infected patients exhibited no symptoms and had recovered from the disease it has been observed from the data obtained that all the asymptomatic patients were less severely infected and a majority of them acquired infection from others the death rate among healthcare workers is negligible this is due to increased infection awareness early diagnosis and protective measures taken 26 the univariate analysis of survival yields the result that gender is a significant factor and male are more likely to die there is a considerable difference between the number of male and female infected patients furthermore the survival rate in women are more than men this may be due to the following reasonsinearly 33 of the infected women are healthcare personnel while it is only 8 in the case of meniithe social set up in the country makes men more prone to the disease than women 27iiicompared to women men are most likely to be in direct contact with camels as per the data analysed nearly 94 of the patients in contact with camels were men
however it is evident from table 2 that on performing multivariate analysis gender feature turns out to be least significant 11 this is due to the fact that attributes such as age pre-existing diseases and critical initial status shield the gender attribute it is obvious that irrespective of gender the aforementioned characteristics adversely affect recovery univariate analysis shows that acquiring infection from others is a significant feature the death rate due to primary infection is nearly double that of infection acquired from others both univariate and multivariate analysis shows that age is a significant attribute in determining recovery and older people are more likely to die the mortality rate is around 50 in patients above 50 years of age this is attributed to the fact that they are most likely to suffer from other comorbidities 12 both univariate and multivariate analysis reflect that pre-existing diseases have a negative impact on recovery the above facts suggest that the elderly and people suffering from comorbidities demand special care in the treatment of mers 18initial status is the most significant attribute as per the results of both univariate and multivariate analysis this result is consistent with the other machine learning model based methods used in the present work the results of which are depicted in fig 1 positive value for the estimate of initial status stable indicates that the recovery rate is high in patients with less severe diseasein this paper the main factors influencing the recovery of mers patients in saudi arabia are identified based on cases reported by command and control centre of ministry of health ksa machine learning models and statistical analysis are used for this purpose the important factors identified include the patients age pre-existing diseases initial status severity of the infection and whether heshe is a healthcare worker or not though mers co-v is zoonotic in nature animal exposure is not a major factor leading to death this is evidently due to stable initial condition of majority of the patients exposed to camels the experiments conducted show that the severity of the disease is the most significant factor influencing recovery from the disease it is apparent that the mortality rate can be reduced considerably if the infected people seek medical attention at the earliest therefore widespread public awareness regarding the symptoms of mers will play a vital role in increasing the recovery rate since the infection also spreads due to person to person contact an effective monitoring system is highly essential to prevent the disease from spreadingno funding sourcesnone declarednot requiredat the end of 2019 some patients in wuhan china developed bilateral pneumonia that was subsequently determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 the disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and it has become a pandemic that has rapidly spread virtually worldwide the virus is transmitted via oronasal cavities 2 through aerosols and droplets from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients 34 the most common symptoms reported in china include fever coughing dyspnea sputum production myalgia arthralgia headache and diarrhea otolaryngologic symptoms were less prevalent in those studies but included sore throat 715 nasal discharge 5 nasal obstruction 5 and anosmia andor ageusia 5 5smell and taste dysfunction have been reported by otolaryngologists in covid-19 patients sometimes as the sole symptoms present and this has led to issue specific recommendations in this regard some evidence has emerged implicating both olfactory and gustatory disruptions as indicative clinical symptoms in covid-19 patients outside chinathe aims of the current study were to investigate and characterize the occurrence duration and recovery of olfactory and gustatory disruptions in a geographically defined cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 and investigate the relationships between these disruptions and demographic and clinical featuresan observational cohort study involving consecutively diagnosed covid-19 patients between march the 3rd 2020 and march the 24th 2020 in the province of lugo spain was performedinclusion criteria were age  18 years and covid-19 confirmed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr the exclusion criteria were inability to speak on the telephone olfactory or gustatory dysfunction prior to the covid-19 epidemic and lack of informed consent insufficient cognitive skills to collaborate were also considered an exclusion criterion cognitive skills were assessed via interview subjectively assessed by the evaluator and from medical recordsinitial telephone interviews were conducted between april the 1st 2020 and april the 10th 2020 by four researchers form april the 14th 2020 to june 25th 2020 researchers re-contacted patients who had reported persistence of symptoms during the first telephone interview to assess whether they had recovered or were experiencing ongoing persistenceelectronic charts were reviewed during telephone interviews and all relevant clinical data were confirmed by the patient the questionnaire included age sex date of clinical onset date of testing general clinical symptoms fever dry cough dyspnea diarrhea myalgia among others and their dates of onset presence of otolaryngologic symptoms rhinorrhea nasal obstruction sore throat otalgia facial pain and medical history specific otolaryngologic history comorbidities previous chronic treatment current treatment based on potentially relevant laboratory test results imaging and clinical data obtained from electronic records patients were classified in accordance with wang et al 6 and assigned to a mild group mild to moderate in wangs classification or to a severe group severe and critical in wangs

changes in their sensitivity but that they still had maintained perception of strong odors or anosmic group unable to perceive any smells taste impairment was measured by means of relevant questions featured in the united states national health and nutrition examination survey 8 based on the patients answers they were assigned to a no symptoms group no change in their ability to perceive taste a dysgeusia group alteration or distortion of their ability to taste or an ageusia group their ability to taste was reduced or abolishedgalicia ethics committee santiago de compostela spain approved the study protocol study code 2020-186 and informed consent was obtained from all patientsstatistical analyses were performed using version 352 of the r programming language r project for statistical computing r foundation relationships between variables were assessed via the chi-square test the kaplan-meier method was used to generate curves to estimate the timing of the emergence of symptoms and curves derived from patients with mild disease were compared with curves derived from patients with severe disease via the log-rank test lastly the comparative influences of different factors on diseases severity were investigated using logistic regression associated odd-ratios and 95 confidence intervalsthe first 184 patients who tested positive in the first 1007 pcr tests performed at lugo were considered for inclusion in the study but 33 were excluded based on the aforementioned criteria of these 33 patients 9 had been intubated in the intensive care unit during the study 7 were in the intensive care unit and their clinical circumstances rendered participation in the interview impossible 7 had died 4 were uncontactable 3 had dementia 2 were aged 18 years and 1 refused to participate a total of 151 patients completed the study 53 men and 98 women and their mean age was 552 years range 1888 years thirty-five patients were included in the severe group because they fulfilled the

 although all patients reported improvement in 1175 147 patients the symptom remained at the final follow-up timepoint which constituted durations ranging from 91 to 108 days mean 1005  33 days in those in whom the symptom had resolved by the final follow-up timepoint it had lasted from 3 to 60 days mean 177  89 days 552 of them in the first 12 days fig 2
gustatory dysfunction was reported by 91151 patients 603 including 59 391 who reported ageusia and 32 212 who reported dysgeusia the presence of ageusia or dysgeusia was only significantly associated with sex 683 in women vs 434 in men p  0028the present study adds evidence to the knowledge base pertaining to alterations in smell and taste and covid 19 and to our knowledge its the first study to find association between these symptoms and age sex disease severity and comorbidities the rate of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction found was 656 497 olfactory and 603 gustatory showing a recovery rate of 853 after at least 91 days in the longest follow up reportedthe prevalence of such symptoms varies markedly between studies from 51 to 980 9 several factors are involved in this variation the most influential is the technique used to assess the presence of olfactory or gustatory disruption chart review studies were initially used by vaira et al 10 and mao et al 11 and reported prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction from 51 to 194 records-based investigations underestimate such symptoms because assessment was not included in previous clinical protocols self-reporting of symptoms via online questionnaires has been used by lechien et al 12 reporting 856 olfactory dysfunction and 880 gustatory dysfunction notably however self-reported olfactory acuity is reportedly inaccurate 13 some studies have assessed symptoms via oral interviews giacomelli et al 14 interviewed 59 hospitalized patients and 339 reported at least one taste or olfactory disorder and 186 reported both although they may both underestimate or overestimate olfactory acuity 15 to study the alteration of smell as a symptom of covid-19 it is crucial that the patient is aware of the disruption and can convey it during an anamnesis visual scales may yield more accurate measures of smell and taste than most other methods 16 yan et al 17 used an online visual scale to compare olfactory and gustatory functions in covid-19-positive and covid-19-negative patients and reported olfactory loss in 68 and gustatory loss in 71 of covid-19-positive patients and 16 and 17 in negative subjects validated quantitative olfactory testing is considered the most accurate method of assessment moein et al have used it to compare covid-19-positive patients with covid-19-negative and found that 98 of covid-19-positive patients had objective olfactory disruption although only 35 of the patients reported smell and or taste disruption previously 18different recruitment tools may yield different study results recruiting a sample that includes all infected patients from asymptomatic to critical is very difficult some studies are very weak in this respect because participants have been recruited via the internet leaflets andor word-of-mouth strategies whereby the patient can become aware of the aims of the study 12 other studies have tried to overcome these limitations through different strategies pertaining to demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample 1217 and comparisons with other clinical studies 18in the present study there were associations between these disruptions and age sex and disease severity age is known to be associated with olfactory loss 15 all patients in the present study reported normal olfactory and gustatory function before covid-19 onset and disruption was based on differential acuity thereafter only one previous study has shown this 14 some evidence suggests that olfactory capacity is worse in men than in women at all ages 15 in the covid-19 patients in the current study olfactory and gustatory disruptions were more common in women than in men as it has been reported in other studies 1214 but this was not found in objective testing studies 18 it could mean that women can be aware of smell and taste alteration better than menin our study we found an association between presence of comorbidities and clinical severity and smell disruptions patients with one or more comorbidities reported less smell and taste disruptions and the timing of presentation differed between severe and non-severe patients mild and moderate patients reported an earlier onset of olfactory dysfunction this has not been reported in previous studies even if yan et al 19 reported that anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care the meaning of the observation is not clear one proposed pathophysiological mechanism of anosmia involves a bigger local inflammatory response the first days of the infection mediated by upregulated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which increases the risk of coronavirus infection resulting in greater olfactory dysfunction but protecting against lung injury as it was proposed in smokers 20in the present study smell and taste disruptions occurred at various points during disease progression the existence of a common syndrome associated with covid-19 infection termed isolated sudden onset anosmia has been proposed in some studies 21 notably only 2 patients in the present study reported other non-olfactory and non-gustatory symptoms probably exhaustive interview with simultaneous access to clinical electronic data and close follow up allowed to identify other symptoms associatedthere is a lack of evidence about long term prognosis of olfactive disruption in covid-19 hopkins et al 22 stated that 801 of patients reported improvement in one week and chary et al 23 found that 64 of patients referred complete recovery after 15 days in the present study 853 patients experienced a total recovery of the smell in the first two months smell disruption improved in the remaining patents although continue after three months suggesting that recovery will be more difficult the longer the symptom laststhe pathophysiology of olfactory and gustatory disruption in covid-19 patients remains unclear in the olfactory system sustentacular cells stem cells and perivascular cells but not in olfactory sensory neurons or olfactory bulb neurons constitute a prime candidate for sars-cov-2 infection via the nose and possibly for sars-cov-2-induced anosmia because like respiratory ciliated cells they both have ace2 receptors and membrane-anchored serine protease 2 which are uncommon characteristics in other human tissues via these components nerve dysfunction may be mediated by damage to support cells and ensuing inflammation without neuronal infection or altering neurotransmission in the absence of neurosensory cell death 24 enabling regeneration fluctuation and spontaneous improvement taste sensory receptors may be affected in a similar way because ace2 receptors are expressed in the oral mucosa 2526the main aim of the present study was to investigate a representative sample of patients that was minimally affected by the usual sources of recruitment bias thus it included all patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the first test performed during a short period in a specific geographical area and resulted in a representative sample with regard to age sociocultural background and disease severity we consider telephone interviews based on a validated questionnaire the most reliable way to assess the presence of smell and taste alteration not acuity both in home-isolated patients and in hospitalized patients and allow a close follow up of the patients that adds information about duration and recoverynevertheless the sample was relatively small and geographically limited the method used to assess olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is not the most accurate ideally an electrophysiological method or sniffing test that can quantify smell and taste acuity and accurately distinguish between olfactory and gustatory symptoms would be used nevertheless such methods require direct interaction between patients and researchers and are thus impractical in patients who are isolated at home or in hospital and may be unnecessary if dysfunction can be reliably established via other patient-based methods irrespective of significance or effects on prognosis although it is the longest follow-up period published whether the persistent olfactory or gustatory disruption reported by some patients at the last interview will be permanent remains to be determinedthese results suggest that during the current pandemic it may be beneficial to investigate the presence and time of appearance of smell disruptions in individual patients with respect to initial diagnosis preventive isolation and clinical prognosis smell disruption has showed less value for patients these disruptions have good prognosis as they improved in all patients with a complete recovery in 853 in the first two monthsolfactory and gustatory dysfunction in covid-19 patients has an high prevalence and smell disruption is associated with and age sex comorbidities and time to appearance is associated with clinical severity although all patients improved some of them reports alteration after two months follow-up so further research is neededall authors contributed equallythis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe data that support the findings of this study are openly available in mendeley data at httpdxdoiorg1017632ngc84bj5h42no conflicts of interestthe x axis is a measure of timethe y axis represents the number of people affected during that time the rate may it be by infection mortality or recovery depending on the type of curvealthough this concept of the curve is often referred to as a single entity there are actually various curves a play in a simple way to conceptualize the population dynamics we can define three fundamental curves the infection curve the mortality curve and the recovery curvethe infection curve describes the rates of covid19 infection across our society figure 1the mortality curve describes the mortality rates across society the peak of this curve is offset to the right on the xaxis as compared to the infection curve figure 2 the peak to peak delta xpm xpi will correspond to the average time duration between infection diagnosis and mortalitythe recovery curve describes the recovery rates across society the peak of this curve is offset to the right on the xaxis as compared with the infection curve figure 3 the peak to peak time difference x will correspond to the average time duration between infection diagnosis and recovery the corresponding peak to peak population ratio deltay will represent the number of people who passed away at the peak the peak to peak ratio y peakrecoveryy peakinfection will represent the recovery rate at the peak of disease figure 3without discussing the calculus of these functions understanding the area under the curve is integral to conceptualizing these curves the 2dimensional shaded area below the curve will represent the total number of cases we will designate this area as auc depending on the type of curve it will represent the total number of measured infections mortalities and recoveries hence the following formula will applyauc infection  auc mortality  auc recoveryin other words the total number of people infected will be equal to the number of people who pass away added to the number of people who recover figure 4to save lives you must decrease the area under the mortality curve flattening the curve will inherently modify the rates of infection mortality and recovery by flattening the curve with social distancing the shape of the curve is different the slopes of the tangents are different however the area under the curve does not necessarily change flattening the curve can bring down the peak and widen the base maintaining the same auc figure 5dr robert katz founding director of the yalegriffin prevention research center has been quoted on this topic if all we do is flatten the curve you dont prevent deaths you just change the dates

this is why to save lives you must decrease the area under the curve flattening the curve does not necessarily achieve that on its own it has the potential to save lives when combined with the following factorsavoiding the threshold of hospital capacity is one way by which flattening the curve can save lives

 by threshold of capacity i am referring the maximal number of people the health care system can accommodate once we reach that limit mortality rises not because we could not have saved those lives it rises because we do not have the resources to save them figure 6basically we cannot all get sick at the same time thats because there arent enough icu beds or ventilatorsflattening the curve can also potentially save lives because it buys us time until we find a cure preventive vaccine or effective remedyif a cure is found then the auc at the tail end of the flattened infection curve will be larger than that of a nonflattened curve those are effectively less people infected on the infection curve and lives saved on the mortality curve figure 7the auc after the cure represents the number of people who avoided the illness that number is larger on a flattened curve ergo flattening the curve can save more people from being infected if a cure is foundsocial distancing measures will bring down the peak of the curve figure 8this consists of building more ventilators increasing the number of icu beds icu personnel emergency room and medical ward capacity figure 9basically the aim is to raise the threshold of hospital capacity so high that the curve does not cross itan earlier cure in combination with a flattened curve will maximize the number of lives saved figure 10to be clear such strategies are designed strictly to minimizing mortality across society during the pandemic this article does not discuss strategies on returning to normalcy nevertheless the ideal trigger to transition from one strategy to the other would be the development of a cure such as a vaccine or effective treatmenthowever if this cannot be found in time our only option may be to gradually return to life on the downslope of the curve doing so hoping that herd immunity may provide protection to the vulnerable in such a scenario mathematical modeling could to inform us on which part of the curve would optimize herd immunity and minimize a reboundwhen a new disease eg covid-19 starts to spread many questions emerge how is the virus transmitted how long is the incubation period what is the influence of those asymptomatically infected what is the definite reproductive number ie so-called r0 how long does viral shedding persist after symptoms faded who is at risk for a severe course and how high is the case fatality rate cfr defined as the total number of deaths known by today divided by the total number of known cases confirmed by today7 the cfr is related to the questions how deadly is this and how many people will die in this outbreak sars mers ebola and h1ni yielded a real cfr of 96 34473 and 04 respectively59 the cfr for covid-19 is of interest to numerous researchers71011due to the underestimated cfr using the formula deathsconfirmed5 particularly at the fast-spreading period several other calculations of cfr were proposed1215 such as deathsdeaths  recoveries and deathscases x days ago where x denotes the lag days from symptom onset to death3 none of the provisional cfrs can accurately predict the real final cfr7 based on the preliminary covid-19 data6 ignoring the underline meaning of the cfr and carelessly reporting imprecise information with cfr deathscases might be biased see the next sectionthe world health organization who in a press conference on january 29 2020 announced the death rate of covid-19 was 2 based on the calculation of cfr deathscases1617 it was substantially underestimated due to assuming no lag days from symptom onset to death and all currently infected cases totally recovered by computing the cfr particularly in the early stages of this covid-19 epidemic11accordingly many big media platform released news with such statements as belowthe mortality rate for the new coronavirus is about 21 currently far lower than the 96 of sars18 with a fatality rate of around 2 which experts agree appears to be the current level for the virus19 health experts say they are encouraged by the steady rise in the number of recoveries they take it as evidence that the treatments meted out have been effective and that the virus does not appear to be as deadly as sars sars had a mortality rate of 96 percent and about 2 percent of those reported to have been infected with the new coronavirus have died20 the wuhan coronavirus seems to have a low fatality rate and most patients make full recoveries21 the number of confirmed cases and deaths indicates that it is around 2 percent significantly lower than sars 10 percenthowever many epidemiologists and people who are following this outbreak closely are assuming that its probably quite a bit more widespread than the case counts suggest22 the statements of underestimated cfr that was false and16 motivated us to ask whether this provisional cfr was truly underestimated with false messages to the public and intrigued us to analyze the data with various cfr calculations in this studybayes theorem alternatively bayes law or bayes rule describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event23 for instance the equation  is to estimate the probability of pa1 based on the condition b someone have cancer a1 or death in this study caused by their age pb the age can be used to more accurately assess the probability of cancer than can be done without the knowledge of the age using bayes theorem to estimationin the current study we are motivated to apply bayes theorem to estimate the cfr probability pa1b through the likelihood of the observed events pb such as the level of staff burnouts and healthcare resource scarcities lsbhrs across countriesregions of covid-19we assumed that supportive treatment is crucial for severe respiratory disease differences in cfrs may be caused by differences in medical resources among a large epidemic versus care of individual cases hence it is hypothesized that the over-loaded burdens of treating patients and capacities to contain the outbreak ie lsbhrs may increase the cfr probability pa1b where a1 denotes the death and b stands for the factor or cause of the deaththe aims of the current study are to compare the differences of the proposed cfr formula and design an app that allows better understandings of the daily cfr on the covid-19 situationswe downloaded covid-19 outbreak numbers in countriesregions on february 14 2020 from the github website24 that contains information on confirmed cases in 30 chinese locations and other countriesregions all downloaded data were publicly deposited on the website24 ethical approval was not necessary for this study because all the data were obtained from the github website on the internetthe prior cfr probability eg 002 is denoted by the deaths a1 the remainder a2 is defined by 1  cfr eg 098 see table 1the goal is to compute the pa1b ie post-cfr in terms of the outbreak lsbhrs pb see fig 1 the lsbhrs is referred to as the next sectionthe shares of the outbreak lsbhrs pb are proportioned in countriesregions based on currently infected cases defined as the confirmed cases subtracted by deaths and recoveries indicating the medical loadings on covid-19 for instance the daily currently infected cases are reported by 4 designated regions as 20 30 50 and 100 respectively the outbreak lsbhrs proportions for 4 regions ie just exampled in this section are thus computed as 012020  30  50  100 015 025 and 05 based on eq 3 see the computation in table 1 where n is the number of regions totallsbhrs means the summation of the outbreak lsbhrs ie the currently infected cases in all regions and lsbhrsj stands for the outbreak lsbhrs in a particular regionthe summation of proportions of deaths ie a1 in all regions is defined in eq 4 where n is the number of regions totaldeaths means the summation of death tolls in all regions and deaths stand for the number of deaths in a particular regionsimilarly the summation of all recovered proportions ie a2 in all regions is defined in eq 5 see table 1 both proportions ie shares for the deaths ie a1 and the recoveries ie a2 in each region are assumed ie just exampled in this section and allocated as the 2 of 01 02 03 04 and 015 025 03 03 eq 4 see table 1from eq 1 the cfr can be obtained in eq 6 see table 1 referring to the example in this section the cfr can be computed by the  where pba1  0101  01502  02503  05040315 pba2  01015  015025  02503  0503  02775 eq 3we can see that the post probability of cfr is increased from the prior probability of 002 to 0023 due to the unequal weights in regions see scenario a in table 1 the final cfr equals the prior cfr at the end of the outbreak see scenario b in table 1similarly the post-cfr for a region can be obtained by eq 7 where sharea1 is the product of lsbhrs and  and sharea2 equals the product of lsbhrs and  see the example 1 in the next sectionfour scenarios are illustrated in the scenario c in table 11  when the prior cfr  004 tj2  the prior cfr when all lsbhrs loadings in regions are zero see scenario b in table 1 and then let pba1  02501  02502  02503  02504  025 and pba2  025015  025025  02503  02503  0253 the provisional  the prior cfr when the unweighted deaths and the weighted recoveries are applied see scenario d in table 1pba1  02510  025 and pba2  02510  0254 the provisional  if the surveyed pa1 and pa2 of weighted lsbhrs are substantially different such as pba1  06 and pba2  01 where surveyed pa1 or pa2 means the proportion from a survey eg how many percentages are experienced with the severe outbreak lsbhrs eg intensive care unit icu in deaths or in recoveriesas such we can apply the formula from 1 to 6 to estimate the post-cfr and verify that unequally weighted lsbhrs loadings cause the cfr probabilitypa1b to increase when  in eq 6 or  in eq 7we created html pages showing the death counts on a choropleth map all relevant covid-19 information on the countriesareas can be linked to dashboards on google maps when the color is clicked25the features and limitations were compared among the 5 cfr formulae includingthe coefficients of variance cv  the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean were applied to measure the relative variability for each cfr the lower is the cv the higher stable is the feature of the cfr computationa dashboard was developed for daily display of the cfr across various regions using the kano model2627 in which 3 features are displayed including the wow feature top one dimension quality middle and the essential requirement bottomthe changes between prior and post-cfrs were compared using the kano model2627 when the bayes theorem was applied to compute the post-cfr details are included in additional file 1 with an ms-excel dataseta choropleth map about the distribution of the deaths in regions is present in fig 2 the darker color means a large number of deaths in the region we can see that hubei province in china with a darker red color when the color is clicked a box will pop up and shows that infected  51986 deaths  1318 003 and recoveries  3900 all data were extracted on february 14 2020three line graphs regarding the cumulative confirmed cases the daily confirmed cased in the recent 7 days and the trend was linked for interested readers to examine the details for more information about the recent covid-19 situations readers are invited to click on the link28 or scan the qr-code in fig 229in fig 3 we can see that the bayes estimation d has the lowest cv 010 followed by the deathsconfirmed 011 a deathsdeaths  recoveries 042 b combined bayes and deathscases 7 days ago 049 e and deathscases x days ago 059 c see table 2 in which we explained the equations from a to e in detailseach method will eventually yield an identical cfr over the course of the outbreak some converged from a lower percentage of cfr to a higher one eg a and d other three eg b c and e dropped from a higher cfr to a lower one from fig 3 the combined bayes and deathscases 7 days ago was recommended instead of the lower cfr who claimed and reported by mediaa dashboard was developed in responding to the daily cfr in comparison to each region the cfr 37 with purple color greater than the whos 2 was shown on our developed dashboards based on data of february 14 2020 using bays estimation on axis y and prior cfr on axis x in fig 4 from this we can compare the daily cfrs for each region other cfrs eg deathsconfirmed cases on 7 days ago and deathsdeaths  recoveries are present when the bubble of interest is clicked interested readers are invited to scan the qr-code in fig 4 and see the details by clicking the bubble of interestfrom fig 4 we can see that all bubbles sized by the post-cfr were within the one-dimensional band using the kano model indicating both prior- and post-cfrs were almost equal to each other the black bubbles would denote the post-cfrs equal to zero even if the prior-cfrs were significantly higher toward the right-hand side on axis x the highest prior-cfr 33 is the philippines on february 14 2020 because 3 were infected and 1 died the highest post  cfr was hubei china with post-cfr  366 higher than the prior-cfr  254 indicating the heavy loadings of the outbreak lsbhrs leads to a higher probability of the post-cfrit is worth noting that the prior-cfr is derived from the deathsconfirmed by today and the post-cfr is yielded by eq 6 the post-cfr 37 greater than the prior cfr of 22 on february 14 and equal to 37 on march 13 was evident of the outbreak lsbhrs increasing the cfr due to weighted scheme applied see table 1the recent cfrs were online computed in fig 5 where prior cfrs are shown on axis x and post-cfrs on axis y the highest prior-cfr was located in suan with 1 died and 1 confirmed case on march 13 2020 see the right-top corner fig 5 all bubbles are sized by the post-cfrs and colored the areas in the kano diagram for instance bubbles in the one-dimensional area are colored in bluethe global with the big purple bubble had an increase from the prior cfr 371 to the post cfr 327 in comparison to hubei china having a decrease from the prior cfr  4521 to the post cfr  352 on march 13 2020 due to the outbreak lsbhrs in deaths relatively lower than that in recoveriesthree countries outside the one-dimensional area are italy spain and france with significantly relative post-cfrs more than the prior-cfrs the recent cfrs are shown on google maps when the qr-code is scanned in figs 4 and 5we observed that the bayes estimation d has the lowest cv 010 followed by the deathsconfirmed 011 deathsdeaths  recovered 042 b bayes based on deathscases  days ago 049 e and deathscases 7 days

respond to the daily overall cfr each individual cfr can be viewed by clicking the bubble of interest3031we found that the method d has the lowest cv 010 and the c has the highest cv 059 the e bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago 049 is suggested to calculate the provisional cfr to the general public the reason for use is illustrated in the next sectioncfr is a measure of the severity of a disease and is defined as the proportion of cases of a specified disease or condition which are fatal16 we believe that who voiced the cfr 217 with misinformation ie underestimation which is only based on confirmed cases ignoring the lag time between the onset of symptoms and progression to deaths as well as in mild cases assuming the lsbhrs being equal across countriesregionswho did not explain to the media and public what cfr implicates the understated cfr has been shared worldwide1822 it is clear that the conventional cfr defined as deathscases in the current fast-growing epidemic gives us a totally useless and unreliable figure when it comes to an outbreak like covid-19 in the past 50 days since february 14 2020the real fatality rate is hard to estimate because we have many currently infected cases yet known the distributions on age sex and other factors such as the proportion of severity in intensive care units icu and patients with multiple comorbidities and the cfr taking into account those clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed cases determined in hubei since february 14 202032what who and media did by publishing cfr 2 has served to avoid public panic for a period of time by displaying the comparison of data with the true cfrs of sars 96 mers 344 ebola 73 and h1ni 0459however true and final cfrs are usually much bigger than the provisional cfrs according to the sars experience when who first reported daily statistics the sars death rate was about 2 it was 24 on march 17 and 18 on march 18 in 200333 in april 2003 cfr was increased to 56 instead of an initial 18 the final cfr in the middle of the summer 2003 raised up to almost 1033that is the reason why we suggested using the bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago in reporting the provisional cfr to the general public through this we can avoid the negative effect of the underestimated cfr and prepare the population including doctors authorities and epidemiologists etc to face the real threat of covid-19dr michael ryan executive director of who addressed that the covid-19 fatality rate is 2 in a press conference on january 29 202016 however most of the confirmed cases of this novel coronavirus are still hospitalized many of them in icus the virus does not kill a person immediately hence creating a lag between infection confirmation and death16 for example only patients that had died by today february 14 2020 would have been taken into account in the provisional cfr but these individuals would have been registered as confirmed cases a few days or more than a week ago the provisional cfr is therefore underestimated due to the potential deaths of currently confirmed cases in the next couple of days aka lag days34 as the number of death increased the death rate has also steadily risen leaving the officials worried based on the cfr trend calculated as deathscases see fig 3upper due to the imprecise and carelessness in the calculation the media has misled the public that cfr of 2 on covid-19 is less than the 10 in sars1621although we compared the final cfr for the sars epidemic with current cfr for covid-19 on the same basis of deathscases what has been forgotten is that cfr was 18 for sars on an early stage in 2003 epidemic calculated using this underestimated method the current calculation of cfr for a growing epidemic stage is not suitable for representing the final cfr an adjusted cfr is required in an epidemic to better elucidate the outbreakwe suggest that in a fast-growing epidemic cfr cannot be used at all when referring to cv or the slop of the cfr trend eg in fig 3 if the true cfr managed to reach over 10 while the provisional cfr was just under 3 it makes no sense to use such definition in the calculation of cfr deathscasesthe best way to calculate the provisional cfr is based on cases that already concluded by either death or recovery however the epidemic is spreading fast and there is not enough time to collect data on how many patients of first say 100 patients recovered and died by any particular day examining the interception of the 2 trends fig 6 might be a reference to predict the final cfr which should be evident in the future with this change it is hopeful that the public would not be misinformed againin our suggested cfr calculation of the method of bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago 3 pivotal components have been focused in the current study assuming unequal lsbhrs proportions based on the daily no-outcome-yet cases across all countriesregions in covid-19 using bayes theorem to adjust the daily provisional cfr and observing whether the cfr trend has been flatted at stationarity phase ie approaching real cfr considering the lag time between symptom to death as the thread alerted at the fast-growing ie beginning periodalthough it is hard to accurately estimate the provisional cfr because we do not know the distributions of age severity number in icu etc an appropriate death lag time eg 7 days was designed in this study the longer this estimated period is the higher the provisional cfr will be316as with all forms of web-based technology advances in health communication technology are happening every moment35 the provisional cfr shown on a dashboard is practical and worth replicating in other fields of a disease outbreak as we demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 interested readers are recommended to scan the qr codes in figs 46 and read the details about the corresponding line graph on trends of the outbreakour study has some limitations first although the data were downloaded from google sheet on a daily basis we are concerned with different criteria for determining confirmed cases among regions that affect the cfr for instance the confirmed cases are from clinically diagnosed cases in hubei since february 14 202032second although we applied bayes theorem to estimate the provisional cfr using eqs from 1 to 5 the post-cfr calculated by bayes theorem eq 6 is strongly related to the prior  cfr the result due to lsbhrs among regions drives a little bit of increase compared with the cfr calculated by the deaths over cases assuming all medical resources and staff burnout are equal the bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago suggested in this study is worthy of investigation in the futurethird the study was based on the data from the github website24 the google team has announced that the service will be terminated and transformed into github24 providing the same information due to the download limit the google team will soon stop the update of this google sheet which might affect the data being transferred effectively and efficiently on the daily calculated cfr eg in figs 4 and 5fourth the post-cfrs calculated by bayes theorem in fig 4 confused us with the gap from the prior-cfrs resulted from the deathsconfirmed by today such as the philippines 0 33 with confirmed  3 deaths  1 and recovered  1 owing to the lsbhrs 3-1-164460 substantially relatively less than hubei china 51986-1318-390064460 366 254 with confirmed  51986 deaths  1318 recovered  3900 the expected cfr for the philippines thus sharply decreases after computation based on bayes theoremfinally we suggest examining the interception of the 2 trends fig 6 as a reference to the final cfr which should be further verified in the futurewe suggest examining the interception of the 2 trends of the bayes based on both deathscases 7 days ago and deathconfirmed cases as a reference to the final cfr an app developed for displaying the provisional cfr with the 2 cfr trends is

read and approved the final manuscriptthe pandemic of covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 caused by sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has created a havoc on the human civilization since its appearance in the city of wuhan hebei district in china it has been a relentless march of new cases and deaths 1 what makes it more scary is the novel strain of the virus and the unknowns associated with it 2 the present strategy has been to prevent its spread by social isolation and a scientific overdrive to manufacture newer rapid diagnostic kits as well as medications 3 4 5 coronavirus belongs to a family of rna viruses within the virus family coronaviridae order nidovirales 6 coronaviruses are divided into three groups depending on the antigenic spikes produced by different protein structures of the virus spike membrane  nucleocapsid 7 the sars coronavirus falls under group 2the ability of this family of viruses to readily undergo genetic recombination not only within same group but also between group makes them readily susceptible to natural selection and changing its nature of virulence 8 the most striking feature however is its ability to freely cross from one species to another hcov 229 e belongs to the group 1 of the coronaviruses family thought to be responsible for the epidemic of common cold 7 transmission from bats to humans is thought to be the initial transmission process for hcov 229 e which had happened within the last two centuries however the two dramatic events- sars-cov originated from bats and got transmitted from civet cats  mers-cov originated from bats and got transmitted from camels in 2003 and 2012 respectively brough our focus back on the coronavirus family 89 the present coronavirus pandemic is the result of changes in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein component via natural selection in human hostin animal vector resulting in its increased affinity for the ace2 receptor site 10 at present we have more than 450000 individuals affected with cov-2 resulting in more than 12000 deaths worldwide 11 in india as the present day statistics holds we have around 718 confirmed cases with 13 deaths 12 several countries including india have gone into a state of lockdown in order to prevent spread of this deadly virus with new rapid-diagnostic kits coming in and trials with potentially helpful drugs underway we need a better understanding of the disease process and what it holds for the near future with all the cov-2 related data available through reliable sources we choose to assimilate the available data on total infection rates total deaths case fatality rates cfr recovery numbers from across the globe and create a predictive analysis on what we can expect in india in the coming weeksthe aim was to identify the top 15 countries ie those most heavily affected and hence could contribute to a substantial quantity of robust data and compute a predictive model for india we thought this was of paramount importance since it would help understanding as well as planning for the future course of actionindia has entered week 4 this analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the covid-19 in indiathere was one missing data na in the dataset which was the recovery numbers from the us in view of the heterogeneity of data and significant outliers data imputation with mean was ruled outas a recovery strategy a correlation analysis was conducted leaving out the us data using python and a strong r  099 p  0001 was found between total number of infected cases and recovery utilising this robust association and the formula generated from linear regression y recovery cases  usa  b0  b1 total cases  usa with b0  -78105 and b1  0869 the missing value 1117 was derived the analysis was conducted thereafter table 1

step 1 correlation study was conducted to ascertain the relationship between the output week 6 death counts and the input variables from week 4 a good correlation was observed with all the input variablesstep 2 multiple regression analysis was done to ascertain the strength of association between the input variables and the output including ruling out issues related to multi-collinearity once again the model created was very robust with r  095 r2  091  adjusted r2  086 table 5 however the p-value for significance was not evident for any of the input variablesstep 3 auto-regression technique- the 5th week death count data was incorporated as the input variable in view of the fact that this end-point was significantly associated with the week 4 death count a separate correlation analysis was performed between week 5 and week 6 death counts and a very robust association r  097 was found justifying its inclusion as the input variablestep 4 using week 5 death count as input a simple linear regression was performed to create a model predicting the week 6 outcomes the model was robust r  096 r2  094 adjusted r2  094 and statistically significant p-value 0001 95 ci 113154step 5 from the regression model formula the minimum maximum and average death count was estimated table 6 the average predicted death count for india was estimated to be 467
assessing the trends of the top 15 most infected countries a predictive model was created for india assuming that the same trend would follow in other words can we justify the drastic measures being taken what can we expect if we allow the present trend to continue and mimic the exponential growth experienced by china and our western counterparts our analysis predicts a jump from approximately 10 deaths at week 4211 at week 5 and then 467 by week 6we speculate the need for urgent interventions which are being taken as of now to prevent this drastic and sharp rise in death rates which indirectly also indicates an increase in infection ratethe main limitation of this analysis was that it takes most input data into consideration without taking into account the logistic actions being taken or not taken during the process however the end of weeks results are highly indicative of both the virus-related natural trajectory as well as the local governments reactionssecondly limiting our analysis to the top 15 most infected countries could lead to an over-estimation of the outcomes however faced with a catastrophe of such magnitude it is worth over-estimating rather than under-estimatingin spite of all the limitations the biggest strength of this study was very high adjusted r2 found in all the predictive models in addition there was cross-validation with two different software practically ruling out any error creeping in from one mode of analysisaccording to our analysis if situation continue in present state projected death rate n is 211 and 467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now respectively keeping these projected mortality data in mind current measured for containment of covid-19 must be strengthened or supplementednonenone to declarehuman coronaviruses hcovs were first identified in the nasal cavities of patients with the common cold in the 1960s1 being responsible for 10 to 15 of these cases second only to rhinoviruses2 although most cases of hcov infection show symptoms compatible with the common cold or mild flu-like syndromes the lower respiratory tract can be severely affected as in outbreaks caused by the sars-cov mers-cov species and now with the new coronavirus sars- cov-2 which causes the covid-19 disease1 in china the analysis of 72314 cases up to february 11 2020 showed that 14 of patients with covid-19 had severe disease and 5 were critically ill leading to a case fatality rate of 233 in brazil at the beginning of may 2020 there were already more than 145000 confirmed cases with a case fatality rate reaching 684
in addition to respiratory symptoms an unusual finding started to be noticed in patients with covid-19 sudden anosmia a study focusing on neurological alterations showed only 51 of changes in smell in patients hospitalized with covid-19 in wuhan china5 compatible with a prevalence of 58 of anosmia in population studies6 however in europe 856 of patients with mild to moderate covid-19 had a sudden change in olfaction with 796 anosmia and 204 hyposmia7 this finding did not seem to follow the usual pattern of post-viral olfaction alterations in the usa a study comparing patients with flu-like symptoms showed a 16 prevalence of post-viral olfaction alteration which increased to 68 in positive-covid-19 patients8 similar to the european and in disagreement with the chinese data interestingly in the first study using olfactory tests in these patients carried out in iran the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction assessed in those infected with sars-cov-2 reached 989
the reports of sudden anosmia by covid-19 led the brazilian academy of rhinology abr academia brasileira de rinologia and the brazilian association of otorhinolaryngology and cervical-facial surgery aborl-ccf associao brasileira de otorrinolaringologia e cirurgia crvico-facial to issue the 4th guidance note to otorhinolaryngologists in relation to the disease caused by the new coronavirus covid-19 on march 22 2020 advising that the presence of sudden anosmia with or without ageusia and without concomitant nasal obstruction could suggest the presence of covid-19 in this scenario of pandemic and sustained transmission of the sars-cov-2 virus10
considering this new clinical presentation of covid-19 and the possible variation in susceptibility to anosmia caused by the sars-cov-2 virus in different populations it is necessary to assess the characteristics of sudden olfactory dysfunction in this context of the covid-19 pandemic in the brazilian population as there is to date no brazilian data on this topic moreover little is known about the evolution of sudden loss of olfaction related to covid-19 thus the aim of this study was to characterize patients who experienced sudden olfactory dysfunction during the covid-19 pandemic and in particular their recoveryan online survey was developed by aborl-ccf and abr to be filled out by physicians who treated patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction starting on february 1 2020 in brazil in this context of the covid-19 pandemic the research investigated the epidemiological profile of patients with sudden anosmia or hyposmia associated symptoms comorbidities treatment used recovery from sudden anosmia or hyposmia if there was a test to confirm covid-19 and the result of this test the survey was distributed digitally by aborl-ccf via its website wwwaborlccforgbr whatsapp and instagram data were collected between march 25 and april 30 2020 the participating physicians were asked for authorization to use the included data data on the recovery from sudden anosmia or hyposmia and test for covid-19 were confirmed via e-mail and information on the time for total recovery from anosmia or hyposmia and how long the patient was followed by the doctor were also collectedsymptom prevalence rates were described in percentages whereas continuous variables such as duration of complaints and age were described in medians and interquartile range iqr proportions were compared using fishers exact or chi-square test the difference in age distribution time to total recovery and duration of patient follow-up were calculated using the mann-whitney u test due to the non-normal distribution of data calculated by the kolmogorov-smirnov test the level of significance was set at 5 and the tests used were two-taileda total of 253 patients was included treated in all regions of brazil distributed as follows 142 561 in the southeast 59 233 in the northeast 32 126 in the south 10 40 in the north and 10 40 in the midwest there was a predominance of women 149 patients - 589 and the median age was 36 years iqr 3044 yearsmost patients had sudden anosmia 212 patients - 838 instead of sudden hyposmia and in most cases 196 patients - 775 loss of smell was accompanied by nonspecific inflammatory symptoms coughing fever headache fatiguemalaise myalgiaarthralgia andor anorexia nasal symptoms nasal obstruction sneezing coryza purulent rhinorrhea nasal pruritus and  or nasal burning were reported by 111 patients 439 and sore throat by 16 63 only 364 of the patients reported comorbidities with rhinitis being the most frequent one 53 patients - 209 followed by asthma and systemic arterial hypertension sah with 13 patients each 51 chronic rhinosinusitis was reported by 7 patients 28the treatment was expectant in most cases 124 patients - 490 when opting for some treatment nasal saline irrigation nsi was the one most frequently chosen 66 patients - 261 followed by analgesics  antipyretics in 30 patients 119 topical intranasal corticosteroids incs in 28 patients 111 antibiotics in 22 patients 87 oral corticosteroids oral cs in 12 patients 47 hydroxychloroquine in 6 patients 24 oseltamivir in 5 patients 20 and olfactory training in 5 patients 20the information on the recovery of the sudden olfactory dysfunction was obtained from 227 records 897 121 patients with full recovery 533 76 with partial recovery 335 and 30 with no recovery 132 when there was full recovery the time to achieve this result showed a median of 125 days iqr 9252075 days additionally the time of follow-up lasted a median of 31 days iqr 10539 daysmost patients 183 723 were tested for confirmation of covid-19 with 145 792 positive and 38 208 negative results the untested patients were younger median of 34 years vs 36 years p
  005 with more isolated anosmia 257 vs 71 p
  00001 fewer nonspecific inflammatory symptoms 543 vs 863 p
  00001 and shorter time of follow-up median 15 days vs 315 days p
  0007 than the tested patientssub-analyses were performed between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients there were no differences regarding epidemiological characteristics between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients as shown in table 1
positive-covid-19 patients more commonly had nonspecific inflammatory symptoms coughing fever headache fatiguemalaise myalgiaarthralgia andor anorexia than negative-covid-19 ones 897 vs 737 p
  002 there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for the other symptoms as shown in table 2
 there were also no differences regarding the patterns of treatment used in the two groups of patientssudden olfactory dysfunction in the positive-covid-19 patients showed a lower full recovery rate fig 1
 and a longer duration than in the negative-covid-19 ones table 3
 full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction was less frequent in the positive-covid-19 than in the negative-covid-19 patients 526 vs 703 p
  005 and the time to achieve full recovery from the sudden olfactory dysfunction was longer in the positive-covid-19 than in the negative-covid-19 patients median of 15 days vs 10 days p
  00006 although the time of follow-up was not different between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients median 31 days vs 355 days p
  037when analyzing only positive-covid-19 patients it was observed that those with hyposmia recovered more easily than the ones with anosmia table 4
 there was no difference in the full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction due to the different treatments used and that there was no association between full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction due to the presence or absence of other symptomsthis is the first brazilian study to assess sudden olfactory dysfunction in the context of the covid-19 pandemic the most relevant finding in the present study was the demonstration that the sudden olfactory dysfunction associated with covid-19 had a lower rate of full recovery and a longer duration than in negative-covid-19 patients only half of the positive-covid-19 patients fully recovered olfaction compared to 703 of the negative-covid-19 ones p
  005 considering only those who fully recovered the olfaction it took positive-covid-19 patients 15 days median to fully recover their sense of smell 5 days longer than negative-covid-19 ones p
  00006 the second relevant point is that the full recovery from sudden hyposmia in positive-covid-19 patients occurred more frequently than that from sudden anosmia p
  004women have complained more about loss of olfaction during the covid-19 pandemic representing up to three quarters of the cases11 which however is reduced to two-thirds when there is diagnostic confirmation of covid-197 the present research included a total of 591 of women with olfactory dysfunction being 531 when positive-covid-19 cases were confirmed however it is interesting to mention that population studies tend to show a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in men6 this skewed distribution of loss of smell in covid-19 may be due to the decreased capacity of men to perceive the olfactory dysfunction or even womens greater concern for their health or an actual selectivity of sars-cov-2 for the female genderanother discrepant point between the olfactory dysfunction related to covid-19 and that found in the general population is the anosmia hyposmia ratio the prevalence of hyposmia is usually more than two-fold that of anosmia6 but the studies by hopkins et al11 and lechien et al7 showed that 744 and 769 of the olfactory dysfunction cases related to covid-19 were those of anosmia not hyposmia in agreement with that 834 of olfaction complaints in the present study were of anosmia reaching 869 in positive-covid-19 patientsalthough hcovs are the second most frequent cause of acute nasopharyngitis2 sars-cov-2 does not seem to predominantly promote nasal or pharyngeal conditions7 8 11 12 13 hence the recommendation made by the 4th guidance note of abr  aborl-ccf was to always suspect covid-19 in the current scenario in cases of sudden anosmia that was not accompanied by nasal obstruction10 however among the positive-covid-19 patients in this study 275 had nasal obstruction concomitantly therefore we should not exclude the possibility of covid-19 just because the patient has upper airway symptoms sore throat was uncommon in the present study 69 vs 105 p
  056 according to the findings of yan et al8 who showed that sore throat was independently associated with negative-covid-19 patients with these patients being 4 to 5 times more likely to report sore throat as a symptom than the positive onesnonspecific inflammatory symptoms such as coughing headache fever myalgiaarthralgia and fatigue are usually the most prevalent ones in covid-197 8 11 12 13 in the present study positive-covid-19 patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction had more general inflammatory symptoms with coughing headache and fever being the most common ones than negative-covid-19 patients 897 vs 737 p
  002 corroborating the supposition that sars-cov-2 causes predominantly nonspecific inflammatory symptomssudden olfactory dysfunction alone with no other symptoms is not the norm hopkins et al11 showed that only 16 of patients had sudden olfactory dysfunction without other symptoms consistent with our global finding of 121 of isolated anosmiahyposmia in the context of the pandemic it is worth mentioning that among our positive-covid-19 patients only 55 had isolated sudden olfactory dysfunctiondyspnea was not a frequent finding in the present study which may represent the inclusion of a profile of patients with mild to moderate disease moreover the presence of sudden anosmia seems to be related to the milder forms of covid-19 as shown by yan et al13 alterations in taste were not objectively assessed in this research which may justify its low prevalence when compared to studies that showed high rates of ageusia associated with sudden anosmia in covid-19 cases8 13
hopkins et al in a study with a similar design showed that 801 of the patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction had some degree of olfactory recovery one week after the research thus showing that it is likely that the olfaction will recover well in this covid-19 pandemic scenario however full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction was reported by only 115 of the patients and only 53 of patients in the study were tested for covid-19 making it difficult to extrapolate the data14 our global data also showed high rates of some reported degree of olfactory recovery 868 over a 31-day follow-up period median but this does not mean full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction that is return to the levels before the sudden loss of smell which is desired by patients and doctors considering that 183 patients 723 were tested for covid-19 it was possible to compare the result of sudden loss of smell between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients positive-covid-19 patients had a lower full recovery rate from sudden olfactory dysfunction than negative-covid-19 ones 526 vs 703 p
  005 moreover positive-covid-19 patients who managed to attain full recovery took 5 days longer than negative ones median 15 days vs 10 days p
  00006 therefore our data showed that sars-cov-2 infection caused a type of sudden olfactory dysfunction that was more difficult to resolve than sudden anosmiahyposmia in negative-covid-19 patients which may possibly represent other post-viral olfaction losses since in the present sample only 132 of negative-covid-19 patients did not have other associated infection symptoms there are no data on the recovery of post-viral sudden olfactory dysfunction in the acute phase therefore the present study may bring new data in this sense as well the present study also showed that sudden hyposmia in the positive-covid-19 patients had a better evolution than those with sudden anosmia also an unprecedented finding in the literature testing for covid-19 is not the norm in outpatients in most countries so much so that previous studies of sudden olfactory dysfunction in covid-19 with questionnaires showed low rates of tested patients included in the studies ranging from 33 to 5311 14
the present study involved 723 of patients tested for covid-19 the untested patients had a more benign profile younger age and fewer associated symptoms which probably led to the shorter time of follow-up and possibly to the lack of testing due to the difficulties experienced in the pandemic for this purposethe positive points of the present study were the inclusion of a large sample of patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction with a large percentage of patients being tested for covid-19 and with a median follow-up of one month to assess the recovery from sudden olfaction loss the negative point lies in the purely subjective analysis of sudden anosmia or hyposmia which is not as reliable as the psychophysical tests of olfaction evaluation15 on the other hand these more sensitive tests can indicate changes in olfaction in more than 50 of individuals without olfactory complaints16 and ultimately it is the subjective perception of ones sense of smell that matters to the patientthe sudden olfactory dysfunction in positive-covid-19 patients showed a lower total recovery rate and longer duration than in negative-covid-19 patients only half of the positive-covid-19 patients fully recovered their sense of smell with a median time of 15 days to attain recovery additionally positive-covid-19 patients with sudden hyposmia recovered more frequently than the ones with sudden anosmiathe authors declare no conflicts of interestsince coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged at the end of 2019 it rapidly became a global pandemic involving nearly 3 million individuals infected 1 as a global threat to human health the outbreak of covid-19 is bringing public health to the forefrontas the american covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network reported obesity is one of the most common underlying conditions in patients hospitalized with covid-19 2 by analogy to h1n1 infection which obesity predisposed to its severe pulmonary form 3 obesity might play a critical role in covid-19 transmission and deterioration recently clinical researchers discovered that for covid-19 obesity was associated with hospital admission severity intensive medical intervention and mortality 46 given the evidence supporting that obesity increases the duration of virus shedding of influenza a 7 the influence of obesity on the disease course and recovery of covid-19 which remained to be unclear is of importance to investigatethe main clinical symptoms of patients with covid-19 are nonspecific similar to other viral infections targeting the respiratory system included fever dry cough weakness and breathing difficulty 8 clinical evidence marked the presence of extra-pulmonary manifestations of covid-19 like digestive symptoms diarrhea nausea and vomiting 9 notably abnormal liver function alf has been reported in 161763 of patients with covid-19 10 liver damage in patients with coronavirus infections might be directly caused by the viral infection of liver cells previously liver damage has been reported as an important risk factor for severe outcome and death in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 11 similarly recent clinical studies have reported that severity of covid-19 was associated with the incidence of liver injury 12 suggesting clinically significant liver dysfunction an important characteristic of coronavirus infections may be able to predict the prognosis of covid-19 however there are limited studies exploring the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on the disease course and recovery of covid-19 12according to the report from the chinese center for disease control and prevention 81 of confirmed cases were classified as mild in spectrum of covid-19 13 the disease course and recovery of this part of patients determined the health and economic burden covid-19 caused which could be reflected by the hospitalized duration to some extent therefore enrolling patients with mild disease of covid-19 the present study conducted a clinical epidemiological analysis to investigate the association of overweightobesity and alf with hospitalized duration to provide clinical evidence for prevention and treatment of covid-19the present single-centered retrospective study was conducted in the second affiliated hospital and yuying childrens hospital of wenzhou medical university data were derived from 58 confirmed patients who were admitted to the hospital between february 5 2020 and february 20 2020 six patients of them lack

associated with being discharged from hospital in time for these patientsbased on the data from a large academic hospital system in new york city american researchers found that in young and middle-aged patients with covid-19 obesity appeared to be a potential risk factor for hospital admission and need for acute or critical care 4 a retrospective cohort study conducted in a single french center revealed that the frequency of obesity was relatively high in patients with severe degree of covid-19 presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation was associated with severe obesity the disease was more severe with an increase in bmi reaching maximal in patients with severe obesity 5 a spanish study also reported that among patients with covid-19 admitted to intensive care unit icu obesity was the most common comorbidities 16 however there is absence of data about the association of obesity and the disease course of covid-19 in chinese population which might attribute to the lower prevalence of obesity in china than that in american and european regions 17 in addition the existing studies above were more concerned on the patients with obesity and severe degree of covid-19 in consideration of the rapid increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide which doubled since 1980 to an extent that nearly one third of the global population is classified to be overweight or obese now 17 the role of overweightobesity in the covid-19 epidemic must not be ignored in patients with mild degree of covid-19 who were the majority of infected population consistent with the previous findings in american and european patients the present study uncovered that patients with overweightobesity were more likely to be hospitalized longer and lower level of bmi contributed to being discharged from hospital in timealf has been observed in some published studies chinese researchers analyzed clinical characteristics of covid-19 among the 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland china and found elevated levels of alt in 120 198 of patients with non-severe disease and 38 281 of 135 patients with severe disease furthermore more patients with elevated alt reached the primary composite end point including admission to an icu the use of mechanical ventilation or death 18 later a study from south of china also reported a high prevalence of alf 763 in patients with covid-19 and alf became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks patients with alf had higher risk to progress to severe disease 10 nevertheless a study conducted in 52 critically ill adult patients did not find difference in the incidences of alf between survivors 30 and non-survivors 28 19 focusing on patients with mild disease the present study revealed that alf was associated with prolonged hospitalization and alt was a negative factor associated with being discharged from hospital in timebecause the patients with mild disease are the majority of the patients with covid-19 13 the disease course and recovery of this part of patients determined the health and economic burden and the recovery of public health system and development of society patients were allowed to be discharge from hospital only when they were confirmed to be not contagious 14 hence the hospitalized duration could reflect not only disease course and recovery but also the transmission of covid-19 to some extent therefore the present study findings suggested that the increasing fat accumulation even not reaching the extent of obesity and liver dysfunction might be involved in disease course especially recovery and transmission of covid-19the underlying mechanism of the association of covid-19 with overweightobesity and alf was unclear with high affinity for covid-19 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which was supposed to mediate the entry of covid-19 into host cells 20 might be one of the common explanations the expression of ace2 is enriched in adipocyte 21 and cholangiocytes 22 with large amounts of ace2-expressing cells people with overweightobesity will be more vulnerable to covid-19 and more of its pathogen and thus they might be easy to spread the disease and hard to recover in addition the virus might be able to directly bind to ace2-positive cholangiocytes inducing systemic inflammation and finally leading to alf 22the present study has some limitations first this study was retrospective and some cases had incomplete documentation for the history of present illness and the clinical data second the present study did not take into consideration the medical intervention the influence of medicine on alf third lack of the data of other indicators of liver function such as aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase the prevalence of alf might be underestimated forth as patients of this study were from a southeastern city in china these findings cannot be generalized to other regions of varying epidemiological characteristicsin conclusion overweightobesity and liver dysfunction contributed to prolonged hospitalization with high risk of covid-19 individuals with overweightobesity and existing liver diseases required close monitoring and prevention and for patients with covid-19 even when the disease is mild extra attentions and precautions should be paid for those with overweightobesity and alf during clinical treatmentsthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an ongoing viral pandemic that emerged from east asia and quickly spread to the rest of the world 1 this infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and is so far responsible for more than 15000 deaths worldwide 2 human-to-human transmission is characterized by a troubling exponential rate which has led to steep curves of onset in many areas 3 according to the clinical studies from asia the most prevalent symptoms consist of fever cough dyspnea sputum production myalgia arthralgia headache diarrhea rhinorrhea and sore throat 4 5 the spread of the covid-19 infection in europe has highlighted a new atypical presentation of the disease patients with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions the occurrence of smell dysfunction in viral infections is not new in otolaryngology many viruses may lead to olfactory dysfunction od through an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa and the development of rhinorrhea the most familiar agents being rhinovirus parainfluenza epsteinbarr virus and some coronavirus 6 7 however olfactory dysfunction linked to covid-19 infection seems particular as it is not associated with rhinorrheaover the past few weeks some european otolaryngologists observed that many patients infected by sars-cov-2 presented with severe olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions without rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction at baseline no covid-19 was suspected in some of these patients because they had no fever cough or other systemic complaints faced with numerous reports from otolaryngologists all around europe the young-otolaryngologists of the international federation of oto-rhino-laryngological societies yo-ifos decided to conduct an international epidemiological study to characterize olfactory and gustatory disorders in infected patientsthe aim of this study is to investigate and characterize the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory disorders in patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infectionthe clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection have been collected from four belgian hospitals chu saint-pierre brussels chu ambroise par mons epicura baudour epicura ath and university of mons belgium in addition to these ones many other patients infected physicians and nurses have been voluntarily enrolled in the study from the following hospitals foch hospital paris france ambroise par hospital ap-hp paris chu ambroise par mons belgium hospital universitario donostia donostia spain hospital universitario santiago de compostela santiago de compostela spain morgagni pierantoni hospital forli italy department of neuroscience audiology unit padova university treviso italy and medical departments of the universit degli studi della campania luigi vanvitelli naples italythe following inclusion criteria have been considered adult  18 years old laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr native speaker patients and patients clinically able to fulfill the questionnaire the following exclusion criteria have been considered patients with olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions before the epidemic patients without a laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection diagnosis patients who were in the intensive-care unit at the time of the study due to their health status thus we mainly included mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients defined as patients without need of intensive cares since we focused on the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory disorders clinical presentation was not considered in as inclusion criteriaclinical data have been prospectively collected during the ear nose and throat ent consultation in the patients room or over the phone for house-bound patients or infected health professionals the data were also collected through an online form for house-bound patients the online questionnaire was created with professional survey monkey san mateo ca usa so that each participant could complete the survey only oncethe selection of the relevant epidemiological and clinical features composing the questionnaire was carried out by the covid-19 task force of yo-ifos which includes otolaryngologists from north america europe and asia 8 experts analyzed the epidemiological publications of the current and the previous coronavirus infections including sras-cov-1 2002 middle-east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus infection mers-cov 2012 and the covid-19 infection from the literature ten experts jrl ss mh jhs pl ta ld fea cch and cmce developed the questionnaire which consisted of four general questions age sex ethnicity and date of diagnosis three general clinical questions comorbidities general and ent symptoms associated with covid-19 infection seven questions about olfactory function four questions investigating gustatory function and one question about the treatment of the covid-19 infection all patients were asked to complete the short version of the questionnaire of olfactory disorders-negative statements sqod-ns 9 the questionnaire has been translated into spanish italian and english by two native speaker otolaryngologists for each languagethe occurrence of anosmia or hyposmia has been identified in the questionnaire the impact of olfactory dysfunction on the quality of life qol of patients has been assessed through the validated sqod-ns appendix 1 9 this is a seven-item patient-reported outcome questionnaire including social eating annoyance and anxiety questions each item is rated on a scale of 03 with higher scores reflecting better olfactory-specific qol the total score ranges from 0 severe impact on qol to 21 no impact on qol 9 the rest of the olfactory and gustatory questions were based on the smell and taste component of the national health and nutrition examination survey 10 this population survey was implemented by the centers for disease control and prevention to continuously monitor the health of adult citizens in the united states through a nationally representative sample of 5000 persons yearly 10 the questions have been chosen to characterize the variation timing and associated symptoms of both olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions and therefore they suggest a potential etiology note that we assessed the mean recovery time of olfaction through four defined propositions 14 days 58 days 914 days and  15 daysreferring to the studies that have demonstrated that the viral load was significantly decreased after 14 days 11 we assessed the short-term olfaction non-recovery rate on patients exhibiting double criteria an onset of the infection  14 days before the assessment and the lack of general symptoms at the time of the evaluationstatistical package for the social sciences for windows spss version 220 ibm corp armonk ny usa was used to perform the statistical analyses the potential associations between epidemiological clinical and olfactory and gustatory outcomes have been assessed through cross-tab generation between two variables binary or categorical variables and chi-square test incomplete responses were excluded from analysis the differences in sqod-ns scores between patients regarding the olfactory dysfunction were made through the kruskalwallis test a level of p  005 was used to determine statistical significancethe general symptoms of patients during the infection are described in fig 2 cough myalgia loss of appetite diarrhea fever headache and asthenia were the most prevalent symptoms accounting for more than 45 of patients the otolaryngological symptoms most related to the infection are reported in table 2a total of 357 patients 856 had olfactory dysfunction related to the infection among them 284 796 patients were anosmic and 73 204 were hyposmic phantosmia and parosmia concerned 126 and 324 of patients during the disease course respectively the olfactory dysfunction appeared before 118 after 654 or at the same time as the appearance of general or ent symptoms 228 note that 94 of patients did not remember the time of onset of olfactory dysfunction and therefore were not considered for the percentage evaluationconsidering the 247 patients with a clinically resolved infection absence of general and ent symptoms the olfactory dysfunction persisted after the resolution of other symptoms in 630 of cases the mean time between the onset of the disease and the assessment of this group of patients was 977  568 daysthe short-term olfaction recovery rate which was assessed in 59 clinically cured patients was 440 the different recovery times of the olfactory function of patients who reported a recovery of the olfactory function are available in fig 3 in total 726 of these patients recovered olfactory function within the first 8 days following the resolution of the disease among the patients who reported anosmia then excluding hyposmic patients the olfactory function recovered throughout the 8 first days following the resolution of the disease in 678 of cases fig 3in the present study 76 patients did not suffer from nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea 182 among them 203 did not report olfactory dysfunction whereas 662 and 135 suffered from anosmia and hyposmia respectivelythe impact of olfactory dysfunction on patient qol is reported in table 3 anosmic patients at the time of the evaluation had a significant lower sqod-ns score compared with hyposmic and normosmic individuals p  0001 kruskalwallisa total of 342 patients 888 reported gustatory disorders which was characterized by impairment of the following four taste modalities salty sweet bitter and sour note that 32 patients did not remember if they had gustatory dysfunction and therefore they were not considered for the assessment of the gustatory disorder prevalence the gustatory dysfunction consisted of reduceddiscontinued or distorted ability to taste flavors in 789 and 211 of patients respectivelyamong the 43 patients without gustatory dysfunction 19 442 have no olfactory dysfunction whereas 16 372 and 4 93 patients had anosmia or hyposmiathe olfactory and gustatory disorders were constant and unchanged over the days in 728 of patients whereas they fluctuated in 234 of patients among the patients who reported gustatory and olfactory disorders 38 revealed that these disorders occurred during their rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction episodesamong the cured patients who had residual olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction 539 had isolated olfactory dysfunction 225 had isolated gustatory dysfunction and 236 had both olfactory and gustatory dysfunctionsthere was no significant association between comorbidities and the development of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions olfactory dysfunction was not significantly associated with rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction there was a significant positive association between olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions p  0001 the statistical analysis identified a significant association between the fever and the anosmia p  0014 the females would be proportionally more affected by hyposmia or anosmia compared with males p  0001 similar results were found for gustatory dysfunction p  0001 mannwhitney u testthe following general treatments have been considered for patients with the covid-19 infection paracetamol 624 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 98 nasal saline irrigations 96 chloroquine 79 mucolytics 50 and oral corticosteroids 14 with concomitant antibiotics fig 4 the treatments that have been most used for olfactory dysfunction were nasal saline irrigations 167 nasal corticosteroids 81 oral corticosteroids 25 and others 25 eg vitamins non-corticoid decongestants and trace elements fig 4 gustatory dysfunction was treated in 14 of patients four patients received treatment consisting of l-carnitine or trace elements and vitamins telemedicine has been used in 426 of patients for prescribing the treatmentover the past few weeks an increasing number of otolaryngologists reported sudden anosmia or hyposmia as concurrent symptoms of covid-19 infection in these patients the diagnosis of covid-19 could be missed because these symptoms were not known to be specific as a result the patients were not isolated and the spread of the virus continued in this context the covid-19 task force of the yo-ifos has conducted this study to investigate the prevalence and the short-term evolution of both olfactory and gustatory disordersbased on the national health and nutrition examination survey questions our results support that olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are both prevalent in patients with mild-to-moderate covid-19 infection thus 856 of patients reported olfactory dysfunction 796 of them having anosmia interestingly many profiles of patients have been identified first our data showed that 797 of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea reported hyposmia or anosmia supporting the role of otolaryngologists as the first-line physicians for some covid-19 patients second the olfactory dysfunction may appear before during or after the general symptoms with the occurrence of fever being associated with the olfactory dysfunction there have been few studies on the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in asia since only one study reported hyposmia as a symptom of the covid-19 infection 12 in the study of mao et al patients with peripheral nervous system symptoms attributed to covid-19 infection the most common the most common complaints were hypogeusia 56 and hyposmia 51 12 according to the data of the present study the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is substantially higher in european covid-19 patients in addition to the high prevalence physicians must keep in mind that olfactory disorder may appear before the rest of the complaints in 118 of cases yielding the symptoms important for the early detection of the diseaseone of the most important questions from the otolaryngologists concerned the recovery of olfactory and gustatory functions although our results are still preliminary it seems that at least 255 of patients recovered both olfactory and gustatory functions throughout the 2 weeks after the resolution of general symptoms considering the time to get a significant reduction of the viral load 10 we have estimated that 56 of patients have persistent olfactory dysfunction over the days following the resolution of the covid-19 general clinical manifestations in the same vein some patients seemed to recover olfaction but not taste and vice versa naturally there are short-term observations and it is reasonable to think that a large number of these patients will recover the olfactory or gustatory functions over the weeks following the disease resolution to summarize the present study clearly supports the recent declarations of many physicians from south korea iran germany italy spain france belgium uk and us that olfactory and gustatory functions may be impaired in covid-19 patientsthe pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in the covid-19 infection are still unknown coronavirus has already been identified as a family of viruses that may be associated with anosmia 6 in 2007 suzuki et al demonstrated that coronavirus may be detected in the nasal discharge of patients with olfactory dysfunction moreover they observed that some patients with normal acoustic rhinometry did not recover their olfaction suggesting that nasal inflammation and related obstruction were not the only etiological factors underlying the olfactory dysfunction in viral infectionthe ability of human coronavirus to invade the olfactory bulb and therefore the central nervous system is most likely a future research path for improving the knowledge about the clinical presentation of patients from a biomolecular standpoint viruses could infect peripheral neurons using the cell machinery of active transport to access the central nervous system 13 thus for the sars-cov receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 it has been demonstrated on transgenic mice that sars-cov may enter the brain through the olfactory bulb leading to rapid transneuronal spread 14 interestingly authors demonstrated that the virus antigen was first detected 6066 h post-infection and was most abundant in the olfactory bulb regions of the cortex piriform and infralimbic cortices basal ganglia ventral pallidum and lateral preoptic regions and midbrain dorsal raphe were also strongly infected after the virus had spread 14 these regions are connected with the olfactory bulb the rapid spread of sars-cov in the brain was also associated with significant neuronal death in humans autopsy samples from eight patients with sars revealed the presence of sars-cov in brain samples by immunohistochemistry electron microscopy and real-time rt-pcr 15 it is currently suspected that the neuroinvasive potential of sars-cov2 plays a key role in the respiratory failure of covid-19 patients 16 medical imaging and neuropathology will certainly play an important rule to detect abnormalities in olfactory bulb cranial nerves and brain of covid-19 patientsthe otolaryngological symptoms in our european cohort were particularly prevalent compared with the asian cohorts in their clinical series of 99 patients chen et al reported four patients with rhinorrhea 4 17 then guan et al reported a prevalence of nasal obstruction in 5 of patients in a cohort of 1099 patients 18 the lack of otolaryngological complaints in asian papers eg nasal obstruction rhinorrhea and olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions raises many questions either they did not assess the ent complaints or the chinese patients had a few ent complaints the second hypothesis may be likely regarding previous studies benvenuto et al have recently compared the complete genomes of 15 virus sequences from patients treated in different regions of china with other coronaviruses 19 interestingly they observed mutations of surface proteins spike-s-protein and nucleocapsid-n-protein conferring stability to the viral particle such mutations could be clinically relevant because the viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell whereas the n-protein plays a pivotal role in the virus transcription and assembly efficiency previously chan et al determined five virus sequences from patients traveling in wuhan at the end of december 2019 this study reported identities but less than 68 with the sars-related coronaviruses in specific domains particularly the external subdomain region of receptor-binding domain of the s-protein only presents 39 identity and chan et al propose that it might affect the choice of human receptor and therefore the biological behaviour of this virus 20 the affinity of some viruses for some tissues and individuals constitutes another area to investigate and explain the potential clinical differences between patients from different world regions recent studies suggested that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is the receptor of sars-cov-2 could be specific to certain populations li et al demonstrated that some ace2 variants could reduce the association between human ace2 and sars-cov s-protein 21 in other words the expression level of ace2 in different tissues might be critical for the susceptibility symptoms and outcomes of covid-19 infection 21 moreover the comparison of the 15 expression quantitative trait loci eqtls variants of the ace2 gene suggested that there will be a lot of ace2 polymorphisms and ace2 expression levels between asian and european populations 22 according to these studies it is conceivable that the diversity of ace2 expression pattern in asian and european populations could be an important track that needs further investigationmoreover regarding our results future studies have to explore the potential gender differences in the development of anosmia the highest susceptibility of females to develop olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions would be related to the gender-related differences in the inflammatory reaction process 23the present study has several limitations first our patients did not benefit from specific examinations for olfactory and gustatory functions including psychophysical tests or electrophysiological methods 24 25 the use of objective approaches makes sense for investigating both gustatory and olfactory functions in covid-19 patients and to avoid the confusion related to the retro-olfaction these approaches would provide many responses for patients who may recover olfaction but not taste and vice versa second our patient sample consisted of young and mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients with little comorbidities they may be not representative of the infected population however it seems ethically difficult to investigate olfaction and gustatory function in patients in life-threatening condition such as patients in intensive-care units note that in this study the majority of included patients were identified from hospital laboratory results however many infected physicians completed the study and therefore it remains possible that many infected physicians participated to the study because they suffered from olfactory dysfunction although the authors have been particularly vigilant to this potential bias third the lack of consistent follow-up of our patients limits us from inquiring into the recovery time of olfactory and gustatory functions and therefore the rate of permanent anosmia or ageusia fourth it seems difficult to identify the potential negative impact of nasal and oral corticosteroids on the clinical course of the disease these treatments are usually used for anosmia or in common nasal complaints in the absence of such data the precautionary principle may prevail and according to the guidelines of the french society of otolaryngology patients must avoid corticosteroids for the treatment of the covid-19 infection all of these weaknesses should be considered in future studies to investigate and characterize the olfactory and gustatory functions in covid-19 patientssince the disease is new and the virus is most likely associated with different mutations and clinical patterns as of yet there remain more questions than answers this study is the first to identify both olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as significant symptoms in the clinical presentation of the european covid-19 infection based on our results it seems that infected patients may just present olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions without other significant complaints the sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the covid-19 infection future epidemiological clinical and basic science studies must elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of these symptoms in such a specific world populationdiseases and bacteria or viruses which cause them often have different names the human immunodeficiency virus hiv for example induces the acquired immunodeficiency disease aids the virus that triggers the current outbreak is called coronavirus 2 a serious acute respiratory syndrome shortened to sars-cov-2 the illness shortened to covid-19 is called coronavirus disease the world health organization and the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv 1 gave these names in public speaking the who also refers to the virus as the virus accountable for covid-19 or the covid-19 virus the outbreak was first reported in wuhan city china wuhan is the capital of the hubei province and has a population of around 11 million chinese authorities reported a cluster of related pneumonia cases in the town on 29 december 2019 a novel coronavirus which was later called sars-cov-2 soon confirmed to cause these cases 27 the first covid-19 cases outside of china were found in thailand on january 13 and in japan on january 16 8 the chinese government put the city of wuhan and other cities in the area on lockdown on january 23 covid-19 has since spread to several more countries-cases have been recorded in all regions of the world it grew into a global pandemic by march 2020 and was announced by the who as such 911 while people sometimes refer to the virus that causes covid-19 as the coronavirus several different coronaviruses do exist the word refers to a group of viruses specific to humans coronaviruses cause about 30 percent of all cold cases 12 corona is latin for crownthis group of viruses is named because under an electron microscope its surface looks like a crown as the outbreak of the novel sarscov2 is increasingly spreading in china and beyond threatening to become a global pandemic epidemiological data need to be interpreted in such a way that the model of statistical data analysis and visualization can increase the understanding of situation among the mass population in the coming days 13 14the world health organization who johns hopkins university researchers and other agencies all maintain dataset on the number of confirmed infected cases deaths and disease recoveries all data obtained in this research work is from johns hopkins university and is freely accessible via the github repository the dataset covered the period from 22 january 2020 to 17 april 2020 which includes time-series and aggregated data 15we statistically analyzed our dataset with various methods of data analysis and visualized those data to provide a proper understanding of the covid19 outbreak worldwide our exploit analysis was carried out by johns hopkins university with the 2019 coronavirus dataset januaryapril 2020 here between 22 january 2020 and 17 april 2020 we present an effort to visualize and analyze the results covid19 has so far propagated nearly 185 countriesregions 83 citiesprovinces have been registered and 264 separate geographical locations combined using time-series data it estimated the number of individual cases such as confirmed infected deaths and recovered around the globe and the top 10 countries in the world as of 17 april 2020 the united states and spain are among the top ten countries in the world further to the discussion on different cases such as confirmed illnesses deaths and recovery in those countries as seen in the fig 1worldwide the total confirmed infected cases are 2152646 and the global average rate is 038 with a standard deviation of 215 the global average rate of the top 10 countries is 773 with a standard deviation of 849 in this circumstance the us ranked first with a total of 667801 the global percentage is 3102 and with a total of 184948 the global percentage of 859 spain is second the estimated number of deaths worldwide is 143800 with a global average of 361 for this situation the us occupied the first place with 32916 counts and with 22170 counts italy was second in the top 10 countries around the world the total number of cases recovered is 542107 in the world in this scenario germany ranked first with a total of 77000 with a total of 74797 spain ranked second and the us ranked fourth with a total of 54703 in the top 10 countries of the worldfrom a statistical data analysis it can be understood that 5 of deaths and 8 of recoveries occurred in reported cases in the united states in spain 10 of deaths and 40 of recoveries occurred in confirmed caseswe also explore time-series data using visual data analysis to provide a clear and understandable outcome of this extreme outbreak of covid19 this segment will analyze various time-series data using several visual data analysis approaches with the r programming language we have created a graph and given awareness of how sarscov2 spread around the globe from 22 january 2020 to 17 april 2020 it allows individuals to grasp the epidemiological essence of covid19 figure 1 indicates that the confirmed infected cases have been crossed by 2000000 cases around the globe many cases such as death recovery and active have also been shown new cases reported on a single day do not actually represent new cases on that day as the number of confirmed infected cases or deaths announced by any organizationincluding who ecdc johns hopkins university and othersdoes not reflect the total number of new cases or deaths on that day this is due to the long chain of reporting that occurs between a new case or death and its inclusion in national or international statisticsregression and generalized linear models glm of data from the covid-19 time series are used to analyze confirmed infected deaths and recovered cases the fitted models have yielded better statistical results the findings shown below represent all three cases in the usa from the models results obtained on the confirmed case the exponential model coefficients are  0807 and 017 the glm poisson model coefficients are 3469 and 0119 and the glm gamma model coefficients are  0433 and 017 both of which are statistically significant as shown in fig 2 in case of death the exponential model coefficients are  2774 and 0144 the glm poisson model coefficients are  2424 and 0151 both of which are statistically reasonable in the recovered case the exponential model coefficients are  2204 and 0137 the glm poisson model coefficients are  2864 and 0163 both of which are statistically significant from the findings it can be understood that all cases such as confirmed infected deaths and recovered are linearly increased the same thing is reflected in the upper part of the graph ie the output of linear and generalized linear models regression and generalized linear models of the covid-19 time series were also used to analyze confirmed infected death and recovered cases in spain the fitting models have provided better statistical results the findings shown below reflect all three cases in spain here too the count has risen linearly in the confirmed case the exponential model coefficients are  2278 and 0185 the glm poisson model coefficients are 4159 and 0093 both of which are statistically significant in case of death the exponential model coefficients are  2919 and 0152 the glm poisson model coefficients are 1329 and 0104 both of which are statistically fine in the recovered case the exponential model coefficients are  2876 and 0165 the glm poisson model coefficients are 0914 and 0124 both of which are statistically appropriatein the event of an outbreak of an infectious disease it is necessary not only to track the number of deaths but also the rate of increase in the number of deaths if there is a fixed number of deaths over a fixed period of time we call that linear growth but if they continue to double within a fixed time span we call it exponential growth based on the results looking at the rate of death growth we have understood that it is linear growth in the us and spain figure 3 indicates that changes every day occurred in confirmed cases between 22 january 2020 and 17 april 2020 from the usa and spain by this we will conclude that the reported cases will accelerate on 20 march 2020 and that the last day of change is 31451 in the us in spain the confirmed case rises linearly from 03 march 2020 to 15 april 2020 the last day of change is 7304 it is clear that the real-time analysis of these data is extremely useful in documenting the epidemiological behavior of this severe disease we believe that this method of data analysis will certainly increase understanding of the situation and inform behaviorthis study examined three separate categories of data including confirmed infected death and recovered cases across the globe for the period from 22 january to 17 april 2020 it will also include a comparative overview of all the cases reported in the united states and spain nevertheless we are discussing various cases internationally in order to explain the various cases identified over a particular time span after review 2152646 confirmed cases of covid19 occurred worldwide on 17 april 2020 in the us where the highest count is 667801 the global percentage is 3102 death cases were 143800 across the globe 668 with the us top count being 32916 493 the cases recovered were 542107 around the globe 2518 with germany at the top of the list with a total of 77000 cases the visual analysis of the growth rate of confirmed infected deaths and recovered cases between the us and spain is another investigationthe goal of this article on covid-19 is to summarize existing research collect relevant data and make it possible for readers to make sense of the published data and early research on the coronavirus outbreak much of our work focuses on known problems for which we can link with well-established research and evidence on covid-19 the research presented here is based on statistical and visual data analysis methods with the aid of a dataset provided by john hopkins university the research was done with r studio 125033 and r 40 beta versions of the windows 10 operating system each and every description of the different cases of covid19 is documented here between 22 january 2020 and 17 april 2020 we are now also observing the harmful outbreak of the sarscov2 virus to the world this is extremely troubling in this analysis we examined the top 10 countries most affected and comprehensive reported cases of the united states and spainin conclusion the dataset covid-19 2019-ncov from the johns hopkins csse data repository 22 january 2020 to 17 april 2020 was used for our experiment it has supported us to generate and disseminate detailed information to the scientific community and to the public especially at the peak phase in order to understand the growth and impact of the novel coronavirus nevertheless knowledge of this novel sarscov2 virus remains minimal among the general population around the globe raw data published from different sources are not adequately capable of offering an insightful understanding of covid19 as a consequence of sarscov2 a user-friendly data analysis platform would also be more effective in recognizing the epidemic of this severe disease the informative graphics of the visualization platform provide an intuitive interface and a simple view of all raw data hopefully in the coming days we will continue to track the epidemiological data of this outbreak that we have used in this study and from other official sourcesafter a decade from the end of the deepest global financial crisis and recession of the post-war period world growth continues to be slow and even falling in most countries there is now even the risk that the world could be drifting toward a new global financial crisis and recessionthis paper examines the reasons for 1 the slow recovery of the united states after the recent global financial crisis 2 the united states growing faster than other advanced countries particularly europe and japan 3 growth slowing in most emerging market economies and 4 the prospects of the world facing a new global financial crisis
table 1
shows that at the depth of the recession in 2009 the percentage fall of real gdp among the largest advanced nation ranged from 28 for the united states to 56 for germany and it was 45 in the euro area as a whole 29 in canada 43 in the united kingdom and 54 in japan despite powerful traditional and non-traditional qe expansionary monetary and fiscal policies the recovery from 2010 to 2017 was slow in all advanced nations averaging 21 percent in the united states 13 percent in the eu-19 or euro area which even fell back into recession in 2012 and 2013 20 percent in the united kingdom 15 percent in japan and 23 percent in canada britain and canada fared generally better than the euro area and japan since the end of the crisis with growth rates comparable to those in the united states japan suffered six recessions during the past twenty-five years including in the ones 2011 and 2014 and was facing a new recession in 2020the recovery and growth from the recent global financial crisis and great recession in the united states was the slowest of all the us recessions of the post-war period fig 1
shows that the average yearly growth of real gdp following the 20082009 recession averaged only 21 percent over the 20092017 period and as such it was the slowest of all the 11 recession that the united states faced over the 19492017 periodthe general reasons for this are also more or less clear a reduction in the growth of labor productivity and labor force in the united states fig 2
shows that the growth of labor productivity and labor force have been smaller drivers of potential us growth since the global financial crisis than in previous decades and are expected to remain smaller in the next decade  the only exception is the slower growth of labor productivity in the 19741981 periodthere are however some major disagreements on the more basic underlying causes for the slow us growth after the crisis supply-siders believe that the slow us growth was the result of low growth of labor productivity excessive economic regulations and inadequate social and physical infrastructures demand-siders on the other hand blame inadequate infrastructure investments and rising income inequalities that dampened private consumptionduring the first three years of his administration trump adopted many of the growth policies that he promised on the campaign trail on the taxation front the trump administration passed a tax reform bill that lowered the federal corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent with personal income taxes reduced from 7 to 4 brackets of 10 percent 25 percent 35 percent and 37 percent trump was also able to obtain funding for more infrastructure investments and the military but not as much as he promised because of the very large increase in budget deficits and national debt that they would entailon the domestic regulatory front the trump administration rolled back parts of the doddfrank act of 2010 reduced many regulations imposed during the eight years of the obama and of previous administrations and repealed the individual mandate that required every employee to have health care but he did not succeed in repealing the affordable care act or obamacare as a whole as he had promised to do during the presidential campaign and as of the end of february 2020 trump was able only to get partial funding for the wall on the mexican border to reduce illegal migrationon the international front as he had promised trump dropped out of the trans pacific partnership tpp put the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip on hold and dropped out of the paris climate accord he negotiated a new trade agreement with south korea renegotiated nafta now usmca and is negotiating a new trade agreement with japan trump also imposed a tariff of 25 percent on us steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on us aluminum imports from many nations trump also started a trade war with china by imposing a 25 percent tariff on nearly 370 billion of chinese exports to the united states which remained in place despite signing a phase-one trade agreement with china in january 2020 this in retaliation for chinas large scale and systematic stealing of us intellectual property and in order to bring back some manufacturing to the united states and in the hope of reducing the huge and unsustainable us trade deficit with china white house office of trade and manufacturing policy 2018trump predicted that his policies would lift us growth to more than 2530 percent per year as shown in table 1 us growth did indeed rise to 29 percent in 2018 but it then fell to 23 percent in 2019 and it is forecasted to be 20 percent in 2020 and 17 percent in 2021 refer table 1 it seems that the bump in growth in 2018 was primarily the result of the tax reform which caused a sharp increase in the us budget deficit but this was only temporary as it now seems that us growth is reverting back to the post-crisis average of about 2021 percent per yearalthough the us recovery after the recent global financial crisis was the slowest of all its post-war recessions it was faster than in europe see fig 3
 the figure shows that starting at about the same level in 1983 the gdp in purchasing power parity terms ppp at 2014 dollars grew more slowly in the euro area than in the united states salvatore 1998 salvatore 2004 salvatore 2007 and that the divergence widened significantly from the start of the global financial crisis in 2008 until 2015but why was the great recession so deep and the recovery so slow in the united states and other advanced countries one important reason is that the great recession was triggered and accompanied by a banking and financial crisis and experience indicates reinhart  rogof 2009 that this type of crisis is much more difficult and takes much longer to overcome than a purely economic crisis because it is usually accompanied by heavy deleveraging by the banking sector but there also other more specific reasons that made this recovery and growth so slowthe most important of these is the sharp decline in labor productivity in advanced nations since the recent global financial crisis table 2
shows that while us labor productivity increased at a yearly average of 24 percent in 19992006 it rose by only 10 percent in 20072018 comparable figures in percentages were respectively 18 and 04 for japan 24 and 02 in the united kingdom 15 and 05 for the euro area and 19 and 07 for the european union of 28 eu-28 population growth also continued to slow down after the great recession considerably in most advanced nations but again more so in europe than in the united states with the growth of labor productivity and labor force declining the growth of advanced nations declinedanother reason for slower growth and less job creation in the united states and other advanced countries was outsourcing most multinational corporations from advanced nations in their effort to minimize production costs transferred a great deal of production and jobs to emerging market economies especially china during the past decade this started before the recent global financial crisis but it rapidly accelerated afterwards rising protectionism since the great recession however caused disruptions in the global supply chains thus reversing to some extent the globalization process even before trump and this slowed down growth in the united states and the rest of the worldgrowth was also discouraged in advanced nations by high taxes overregulation and policy uncertainty  again more so in europe than in the united states and the united kingdom as shown in fig 4
 to be noted is that the difference in growth between the united states and europe is somewhat less on a per capita than in total because of the higher population growth in the united states than in europe salvatore 2017after their spectacular growth before the global financial crisis growth also slowed in emerging market economies as a result of the crisis klein  salvatore 2013 the economic crisis in emerging market economies started as a result of contagion as the recession-afflicted advanced nations sharply cut imports from and the flow of investments to emerging markets during the global financial crisis this was one reason for the decline in chinas previous spectacular growth while indias growth held up the average annual percentage growth of real gdp in other large emerging countries those in the g20 group has been very slow with exception of china india and indonesia  see table 3
the slowdown in chinas growth rate from 2010 to 2017 however was also the result of the effort to restructure its economy toward more internal demand and from a manufacturing to a service economy rather than relying on continued export growth and on heavy domestic investments as in the past the former because it was no longer sustainable and the latter because of the setting in of the dreaded diminishing returns in the process chinas demand for primary commodity imports from other emerging markets especially from brazil and many african countries also declined sharply this caused an even greater growth slowdown in other emerging market economies than the decline resulting from the recession in advanced countries starting in 2018 chinas growth slowed further as a result of the uschina trade war as discussed in section 4 the growth forecast of china and other countries shown in table 3 also does not take into consideration the reduction of growth of china and the rest of the world as a result of the coronavirus covid-19 that struck china in december 2019 and spread to many other nation in the beginning of 2020 of course if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic as feared in february 2020 the new york times 2020 there could be a very deep world recession in 2020as the demand for their primary exports of emerging market economies declined their currencies sharply depreciated or were devalued thus making the servicing of their previously accumulated heavy financial debt and dollar borrowings of over 6 trillion by 2018 unsustainable emerging market economies also experienced large net financial outflows which exacerbated their economic problems even more brazil faced recession with a decline of real gdp of 35 in 2015 and 2016 russia faced even more economic difficulties as a result also of the wars and the economic sanctions imposed on it and argentina and turkey also faced an economic crisisthe economic crisis in most emerging market economies would have been even deeper had they not been operating under some form of exchange rate flexibility or had not devalued their currencies which cushioned to some extent their reduction in exports and had they not also entered the crisis with more foreign exchange reserves accumulated during the commodity boom of the previous decade
fig 5
shows oecd 2019 that the uschina trade restriction imposed from july 2018 through august 2019 would reduce business investment after 23 years with respect to the baseline by about 28 percent in china 25 percent in the united states 23 percent in the euro area and 15 percent in japan and it would reduce chinas growth by about 10 percent us growth by 07 percent and world growth by 06 percent but if the uschina trade war progresses and intensifies in 2020 the economic harm in terms of the reduction in world growth would be much higher especially if other nations are also drawn into the trade warthe uschina trade war is almost certain to also worsen the other economic weaknesses in the world economy today these are 1 the excessive total indebtedness in the chinese economy now in excess of 275 percent of its gdp 2 emerging markets total indebtedness in dollars which now exceeds 6 trillion and in the face of an appreciating dollar 3 the new financial bubble arising from nominal interest rates near zero in the united states britain and canada and negative in japan the euro area as well as in denmark sweden and switzerland thus leading to inflated stock markets and also leading investors in search for returns to undertake excessively risky investments and now february 2020 we can add 4 the effect of the coronavirus or covid-19 for the result of other similar simulation exercises see oecd 2016 and salvatore and campano 2018each of these weaknesses or dangers could on its own trigger a new global financial crisis and recession but in the current trade-war situation each could actually lead to a perfect storm ie a global financial crisis even deeper than the previous one at a time when most advanced nations have fewer and less effective monetary and fiscal policies tools to deal with itin december 2019 the united states and china signed the phase-one agreement which avoided a further escalation of their trade war but with the united states leaving tariffs of 25 percent in place on nearly 370 billion of imports from china until a more extensive trade agreement is hopefully reached in 2020 this will continue to reduce international trade and growth but even if such an agreement were reached strong international trade controversies are likely to recur in the future especially between the united states and china unless the wto were reformed and strengthened and a truly rule-based international trade system were establishedafter a decade from the end of the deepest global financial crisis and recession of the post-war period world growth continues to be slow and even falling in most countries there is now even the risk of the world drifting toward a new global financial crisistwo very important reasons for the slow recovery and growth in the united states and other advanced countries after the recent global financial crisis have been the decline in the growth of labor productivity and the labor force since these declines have been greater in europe than in the united states the former has grown slower than the latter the reason the growth of labor productivity has been slower in europe than in the united states was due mostly to the higher taxation and excessive regulations in europe than in the united statessince his election president trump has reduced us taxes and regulations and increased expenditure for infrastructures and the military these policies did increase us growth but only temporarily and led to much higher budget deficits accusing most nation of not engaging in fair trade trump also imposed higher tariffs on us imports of steel aluminum and other products on many countries and started a trade war with china which reduced us and world growthin the highly interdependent and globalized world of today the slower growth of advanced nations and china reduced the growth of most other emerging market economies among the g20 market economies only china india and indonesia are growing rapidly even though chinas two digits growth rate prior to the global financial crisis has been cut in halfthe world is now facing the danger of another and possibly deeper financial crisis and recession if the uschina trade war resumes a crisis can also be triggered or amplified by the excessive indebtedness in the chinese informal banking sector by emerging markets total indebtedness in dollars from the financial bubble arising from nominal interest rates near zero in the united states britain and canada and negative in japan the euro area and other nations and if the coronavirus turned into a pandemicvaccines remain one of the greatest accomplishments of human ingenuity scientific endeavor and the combined global efforts of the public health community the rates of incidence and mortality associated with infection by rna viruses such as polio measles mumps and rubella have declined by greater than 95 compared to pre-vaccination rates 1 though highly successful in the past conventional approaches to rna virus vaccine development such as live-attenuation through passaging forward genetics or inactivation may be less efficient for generating good candidates than rational targeted mutagenesis reverse genetics advancements in recombinant dna technology and virus reverse genetics have provided key critical insights into the replication and pathogenesis of rna viruses and facilitate vaccine development through targeted modifications and directed attenuation the advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering of viruses has transformed the field of virology by permitting study of targeted genetic changes in virus genomes in 1981 the first infectious rna virus clone was isolated from cdna to generate poliovirus 2 since then reverse genetics technology and recombinant virus design has been employed to generate reverse genetic clones representing all major virus families in addition these techniques and approaches have now become the focus of new efforts to design vaccines that incorporate specific changes in either component-based or virus-based systems to induce lasting immunity in the host without health risks or deleterious effects since the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines new vaccine preparations utilizing well-established vectors expression of specific viral proteins or components subunit vaccines and development of virus-like particles vlps have continued to shape the domain of vaccine discovery and development the challenge of establishing a safe immunogenic platform which induces lasting immunity in the context of a wide variety of viral systems has resulted in remarkable creativity and variability in the approaches employed use of replicating viruses in vaccines such as live-attenuated or chimeric vector-based platforms have the benefits of high immunogenicity lower costs and ease to transport and administer yet these viruses have the potential to revert to more pathogenic phenotypes and may be under-attenuated in immunocompromised hosts conversely component subunit or killed pathogen vaccines have the benefits of generally being safer and can be used to display the most immunogenic antigens however the costs time of development and weaker induced immune responses present their own challenges to design and implementation in this review we describe rna virus reverse genetics systems and provide an overview of current efforts to use reverse genetics technology in the development of safe and effective vaccinescurrent rna virus reverse genetics systems make use of multiple common features of rna virus biology first rna viruses generate genomic copies through the activity of a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp in addition nearly all rna virus replication strategies are independent from the host cell nucleus and instead reside in the cytoplasm for positive-strand rna viruses such as poliovirus immediately after entry and uncoating the genomic rna is directly translated by host ribosomes to generate viral protein products since the virus rarely needs to package additional nonstructural proteins in the virion most positive-sense rna virus reverse genetics systems largely focus on delivery of either transcribed genomic rna into the cell cytoplasm or delivery of cdna under the control of a viral transcription promoter such as t7 or cmv figure 1 345678910 however negative-strand and double-strand rna virus reverse genetic systems often require the use of additional helper constructs to introduce the rdrp and other essential proteins to initiate genomic replication a recent alternative approach which has been employed in the field of influenza research is to synthesize viral rna and drive mrna production through the activity of the host polymerases such as pol i and pol ii 1112 this approach has simplified the logistics of plasmid transfection and increased the efficacy of recombinant virus recovery a similar approach has been successfully employed for recovery of an arenavirus lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus lcmv 13 one additional platform that has been employed for rna virus infectious clone generation is the bacterial artificial chromosome bac bac constructs are single-copy dna plasmids based on the f-plasmid of bacteria which are genetically stable in e coli and permit the insertion of large dna fragments to be transcribed under the control of a transcriptional promoter such as t7 bac constructs have been employed for many years in the recovery of large dna viruses however the genetic stability of these constructs has led to their use in recombinant rna virus platforms several positive-strand rna viruses and one negative-strand rna virus have used bacs as a platform for reverse genetic design table 1 since most rna virus replication strategies are segregated from the host genome and replication machinery few rna viruses modify host gene expression and cause oncogenesis as a result rna reverse genetic systems do not typically have to account for the potential transformation of host cells lastly most rna viruses are limited to small genome sizes with the majority smaller than 15 kb due to reduced genomic stability and the lowered fidelity of the viral rdrp subsequently reverse genetic approaches often employ the use of cdna genetic clones for greater versatility in manipulation and modification of the virus genome picornaviruses are a family of non-enveloped positive-strand rna viruses which collectively infect a wide range of human and animal hosts human picornaviral pathogens cause illnesses which vary from the common cold to poliomyelitis the picornavirus virion consists of an icosahedral capsid structure surrounding an rna genome ranging from approximately 7 to 9 kb in size poliovirus and rhinovirus remain two of the most extensively studied picornaviruses to date and have become model systems for the study of rna virus biology pathogenesis and epidemiology during the 1950s extensive efforts began to develop and implement a polio vaccine in the hopes to eradicate the virus since no non-human primate reservoirs are known to exist in nature the effectiveness of the inactivated salk vaccine and live-attenuated sabin vaccines led to increased efforts to develop and design vaccines for many other human pathogens international vaccination efforts are aimed at eradicating the disease the success and employed strategies for implementation of vaccines for poliovirus opened the door to evaluating new approaches and efforts to study and understand rna virus biology a major step occurred in 1981 when racaniello and baltimore introduced a full-length cdna clone of poliovirus into a cell and recovered infectious virus 2 although initially the mechanism by which a cdna clone in a plasmid could give rise to productive rna virus infection was unknown the cdna platform approach used by racaniello and baltimore was rapidly adapted to develop similar reverse genetics systems for a number of picornaviruses including coxsackie b virus 24 rhinovirus 25 hepatitis a virus 26 theilers virus 27 foot and mouth disease virus 28 swine vesicular disease virus 29 and two echoviruses 3031 advances in the understanding and engineering of plasmids for gene delivery led to more efficient cdna-based systems which represent the primary reverse genetics approaches used for recovery of picornaviruses today no commercially available rhinovirus vaccines exist today despite effective reverse genetics platforms for several serotypes rhinoviruses remain the primary cause of the common cold worldwide and have been extensively studied for over 50 years yet the great puzzle of developing a broadly protective rhinovirus vaccine involves solving the overwhelming task of developing an immunogenic platform which can provide protective immunity to the greater than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus that currently circulate in nature 3233 the capsid of rhinovirus is comprised of four distinct serotype-specific proteins vp1 vp2 vp3 and vp4 which are known to be immunogenic and potentially elicit cross-reactive antibodies 32343536 yet development of broadly-neutralizing rhinovirus protection will likely require the formulation of a polyvalent vaccine which includes incorporation of several serotype variants of the immunogenic capsid proteins 36 efforts at designing polyvalent rhinovirus vaccine formulations have yet to provide the broad immunogenic memory necessary to be effective however regions of vp0 precursor of vp2 and vp4 have been shown to be conserved across a and b group rhinoviruses and combination with a th1 promoting adjuvant induced a crossserotype immune response in mice 34 the discovery of conserved epitopes and recent development of chimeric or new reverse genetics platforms including a mouse model of infection may provide a novel avenue to the efficient display of epitopes from the breadth of rhinovirus diversity 373839coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand rna viruses which encode the largest known rna virus genomes varying in size from 26 to 32 kb 40 coronavirus infections in humans are associated with upper and lower respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars over the last 12 years four new human coronaviruses have been identified including sars coronavirus and the recent middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus 41 despite a high clinical and economic burden and potential for emerging infectious disease no commercially available vaccines currently exist there are currently two common platforms that are used for generating full-length infectious coronavirus clones the first platform involves in vitro transcription and capping of a full-length cdna clone of the coronavirus genome followed by introduction into competent cells by either transfection or electroporation the coronavirus genome which is approximately 30 kb in size is often maintained as fragments in low-copy plasmids during virus assembly the fragments are restriction digested and ligated together prior to transcription this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of many coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev 8 murine hepatitis virus mhv 10 nl63 42 sars coronavirus 9 sars-like bat coronaviruses 43 and mers coronavirus 5 another common platform utilizes existing bac technology the coronavirus genome is introduced into a bac construct under the control of a cmv promoter this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of human viruses oc43 and mers coronavirus 316 both of these approaches yield productive infections and high titers of progeny virus a third approach involving a vaccinia vector platform has also been used successfully for the production of human 229e infectious clones 7efforts to design a coronavirus vaccine have focused on a variety of approaches including development of inactivated virus live-attenuated virus and a variety of subunit vaccines one major focus of current coronavirus vaccine efforts is focusing on ways to create a live-attenuated vaccine strain which combines existing treatments with a less virulent and more stable virus platform during the sars epidemic patients showed little improvement when treated with ribavirin recent studies have shown that coronaviruses are resistant to ribavirin treatment due to the presence of a viral exonuclease nsp14 with proofreading activity 4445 additionally deletion of the exonuclease proofreading activity results in a hypermutation phenotype that appears genetically stable and induces protection in murine models 464748 the recent outbreak of mers-cov has triggered a demand for the development of a mers vaccine 49 several approaches are being explored including identifying effective neutralizing antibodies use of the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein as a component to induce immunity and direct changes to recombinant mers-cov 3505152 the availability of effective reverse genetics platforms for coronaviruses associated with high mortality viruses such as sars and mers coronaviruses and the potential for low cost for development and implementation provide promise for creating an effective vaccine platform flaviviruses are small enveloped positive-strand rna viruses that infect a wide range of hosts flavivirus genomes are markedly smaller than coronaviruses at approximately 1012 kb in size and the transmission of most flaviviruses is dependent upon an arthropod vector hence their common name arboviruses flavivirus diseases range from asymptomatic to severe neurological disease such as encephalitis meningitis and myelitis 53 yellow fever virus yfv a deadly flavivirus associated with over 30000 deaths annually who was identified in 1901 by walter reed and was the first human viral pathogen ever discovered 545556 outbreaks and disease connected to flaviviruses have stressed the importance of developing reverse genetic platforms and efficacious vaccinessimilar to picornaviruses nearly all flavivirus reverse genetics platforms involve either in vitro transcription of full-length or ligated cdna fragments of the genome or use a bacterial artificial chromosome bac platform table 1 and are subsequently transfected or electroporated into competent cells reverse genetics platforms have been developed for a wide range of flaviviruses including yfv 5758 dengue types 14 5960616263646566 jev 67 kunjin virus 68 tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev 697071 murray valley encephalitis virus 72 langat virus 73 west nile virus wnv 674 and omsk hemorrhagic fever virus 75 advances in the recombinant flavivirus approaches have been instrumental in new vaccine design efforts some of the first vaccine efforts were directed at generating inactivated or live-attenuated strains for vaccinations against flaviviruses in 1937 max theiler developed a safe yfv live-attenuated vaccine called 17d through the use of a serial passaged virus originally isolated from an african patient 76 the vaccine composition used today remains largely the same as that first developed over 70 years ago and provides protective immunity for over 30 years 777879 jev was first isolated and studied in the 1930s and an inactivated vaccine derived from a mouse brain was first developed in japan in 1954 5380 the current formulations of the jev vaccines include inactivated beijing-1 strain or liveattenuated strains which elicit greater immunogenicity and broader protection than the original nakayama strain 53 despite the success of vaccine development for yfv and jev unique challenges have been presented in developing vaccines to some well-known flaviviruses such as dengue virus and new emerging flaviviruses such as wnv dengue virus is endemic to tropical and subtropical locations worldwide to date five distinct serotypes of dengue virus are known including a new serotype identified in 2013 5381 infection with one serotype increases the severity of disease upon a secondary infection with a different serotype 82 consequently any dengue virus vaccine must either provide protection to all extent serotypes to prevent priming for increased disease by a heterotypic infection or remove the immunogenic components of the virus that cause increased disease severity upon heterotypic infections efforts to develop stable chimeric platforms for the development of dengue virus vaccines have recently been focused on expressing dengue virus surface proteins in chimeric viruses with other more stable flaviviruses such as yfv 838485 one vaccine candidate is a tetravalent vaccine from sanofi pasteur which involves the formation of a chimeric yfv strain 17d virus containing the prme genes of each dengue serotype 85 this approach has also recently been adapted to develop similar vaccine candidates to the recently identified wnv 8586 despite several commercially available wnv vaccines for veterinary purposes there remains no approved wnv vaccine for humans the future licensure of dengue and wnv vaccines will likely continue to focus on development of liveattenuated or inactivated virus models of vaccination due to the high immunogenicity of flavivirus infectionsparamyxoviruses are enveloped negative-sense single-strand rna viruses which are responsible for a variety of human and animal diseases human paramyxoviruses have been identified which are responsible for diseases including measles mumps pneumonia and the common cold paramyxoviruses carry a single copy of their genome which is typically 15 to 19 kb in length like other negative-strand rna viruses paramyxoviruses must incorporate their replication machinery including the rdrp into the virion during assembly paramyxovirus reverse genetic systems employ very similar mechanisms first the full-length genome or antigenome and helper plasmids expressing nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins are cloned as cdna and are under transcriptional control by a promoter such as t7 rna polymerase the plasmids are co-transfected into permissive cell lines earlier reverse genetics systems utilized a co-infection approach with a vaccinia virus expressing t7 however most modern reverse genetics systems use a t7 cell line or transfect a t7 plasmid recently the first bac-based reverse genetics system for a negative-strand rna virus was developed for respiratory syncytial virus rsv 21 reverse genetics systems for many paramyxoviruses have been generated including measles virus 89 mumps virus 90 hendra virus 91 nipah virus 92 rsv 2193 despite the availability of reverse genetics systems development of paramyxovirus vaccines has been met with variable success the first paramyxovirus vaccine was developed during the 1950s john enders was able to develop a cultivation system for measles virus and cultured an attenuated measles virus called the edmonston strain named after the child from which it was isolated the edmonston strain though initially underattenuated was later adapted and led to the successfully license of a measles vaccine in 1963 94 maurice hilleman was able to build on the success of the live-attenuated measles vaccine and cultured and adapted by passage in fertilized hens eggs a strain of mumps called jeryl lynn named after his daughter from whom it was isolated 95 hilleman was later instrumental in the development of the mmr vaccine combining live-attenuated strains of measles mumps rubella wistar ra 273 strain which was first licensed for use in 1971 96 the early success of the measles and mumps vaccines prompted renewed efforts to develop vaccines to other pathogenic rna viruses one of the greatest challenges to viral vaccine design remains the development of a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus rsv respiratory syncytial virus rsv was first isolated in 1955 from a chimpanzee displaying upper respiratory illness 97 since its identification rsv has become recognized as the leading cause of infant mortality by a virus worldwide 9899 in the united states alone rsv upper and lower respiratory infections have led to over 100000 hospitalizations annually 9899100 despite a high clinical burden no licensed rsv vaccines are available and current treatments are cost prohibitive while only providing passive immunity by administration of prophylactic antibodies 101102103 the most susceptible population for rsv infection is young infants 9899100 consequently the ideal rsv vaccine must be immunogenic genetically stable and safe for vaccination in infants however an early tragic failure during the 1960s of a formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine has dampened efforts to develop and implement new vaccines 104105 to date the most clinically advanced rsv vaccine candidates have been live-attenuated viruses developed through virus passage and reconstitution by reverse genetics 106107108 one of the more promising of these candidates to date has been medi559 which includes many introduced mutations which render the virus temperature-sensitive and provides some level of protection 106107 however these candidates have not been able to achieve the level of protection and genetic stability necessary for implementation 109 ongoing studies continue to evaluate new targets for attenuation however successful development of an rsv vaccine will require finding the proper balance of attenuation and immunogenicityorthomyxoviruses are enveloped negative-sense rna viruses whose genomes consist of multiple linear segments and are approximately 12 to 15 kb in size similar to paramyxoviruses many orthomyxoviruses cause respiratory illnesses in humans most notable is influenza flu a key hallmark of orthoymyxovirus evolution is the reassortment of the virus genomes through co-infection of a cell in order to be transcriptionally active influenza viruses require a functionally active viral ribonucleoprotein complex rnp which consists of the viral genomic rna nucleoprotein np and the viral rdrp comprised of pb1 pb2 and pa proteins 110 the first reverse genetics approaches developed for orthomyxoviruses were generated for influenza a virus iav however these systems utilized helper viruses that had to be selected against to recover recombinants 111112 the first helper virus-free systems were developed around the turn of the millennium 113114 these first systems required the co-transfection of four or more plasmids under the control of a pol ii promoter as well as eight plasmids expressing the eight viral rna segments the number of plasmids cotransfected for recovery varied greatly depending upon the number of viral genomic segments and the organization of the helper protein constructs ranging from 10 which expressed two of the helper proteins on each of two plasmids using the pol ii promoter and an ires to as many as 17 113114115116117118 however recent advances in the reverse genetics platforms have reduced the number of total plasmids needed to 8 or less using a bidirectional expression system 1112 in this system a human pol i promoter coupled with either a murine poli terminator drives viral rna synthesis and a cmv pol ii promoter is responsible for viral mrna synthesis 11 this improved production of iav however generation of recombinant virus for vaccines is limited to a select number of mammalian cell lines such as african green monkey kidney epithelial cells vero or madin darby canine kidney mdck cells 119120 however these cell lines had limited transfectability and differences in pol i and pol ii compatibility have hindered the efficacy of these uni- and bidirectional approaches incorporation of species-specific polymerase promoters has provided improved efficacy of recovery in several of these cell lines 119120 a recent advancement has been the combination of up to 8 pol i driven iav genes on a single plasmid and up to 3 pol ii drive genes on an additional plasmid this approach improves the probability of a single cell receiving all necessary plasmids during recovery 121 the availability of applicable reverse genetics systems for studying and identifying the structure and function of influenza proteins has revolutionized influenza vaccination strategies for many years the trivalent vaccine that is currently provided consisted of three separated strains 2 a strains and 1 b strain which were selected based on the who recommendations prior to the next flu season however these vaccines were made using either live-attenuated through cold-adaptation or inactivated virus grown in fertilized chicken eggs next generation vaccination strategies include tetravalent or quadrivalent vaccines which may be grown in animal cell cultures rather than chicken eggs or virus-like particles vlps in cultures of s frugiperda insect sf9 cells 122123124125126127128129 in 2013 the fda approved a seasonal influenza vaccine comprised of purified ha proteins prepared using a baculovirus-expression system 130 these recombinant vaccines were successfully used to vaccinate individuals between 18 and 49 years of age and represents a major step in influenza vaccine design and implementation because this system reduces production time compared to the conventional egg-based approach 131 a major frontier of synthetic biology is the development of new vaccines and therapeutics and the improvement of the implementation and efficacy of those already on the market one major complication to the successful implementation of vaccines currently is the limitations in time between vaccine design and production influenza viruses require seasonal vaccinations and determination of the proper formulations leaves little time for development and implementation new advances in reverse genetics technology are reducing the potential time of recovery and production from months to weeks for instance dormitzer et al have developed an improved platform approach and demonstrated that with current reverse genetics technology it is feasible to generate a recombinant influenza virus from new ha and na sequences within 5 days 132 as new emerging viruses continue to appear and pandemics continue to occur rapid approaches to recover and adapt viruses will be instrumental in the public health response development of common chimeric reverse genetic platforms for rapid cloning and expression of surface antigens from emergent pathogens will help increase the efficacy and timing of delivery during epidemic and pandemic outbreaksone key limitation to the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines is genetic stability rna viruses generally exhibit high mutation rates due to decreased fidelity of the rdrp yet recent studies have shown that codon-usage bias can be used to alter the translation and consequently replication of viruses several groups have shown that substituting non-preferred codons based on host cell codon usage bias a process referred to as codon-deoptimization into the genome of poliovirus resulted in reduction of plaque areas and virus yields 133134 by changing codons rather than amino acids the amount of viral protein may be modulated without impairment in its function more importantly the potential for reversion is greatly limited due to the sheer number of codon changes introduced into the coding sequence this approach represents a promising new avenue to develop attenuated but genetically stable vaccine platformsdespite the presence of reverse genetics systems for many human pathogens not all have resulted in successful vaccine platforms advances in biotechnology and key discoveries have led to novel reverse genetic approaches which may be employed in new generation vaccines structural vaccinology or structure-based antigen design has become a common practice for optimizing antigens for display in vaccines 135 as mentioned previously rsv remains a key hurdle to reducing viral childhood morbidity since the discovery and implementation of palivizumab currently the only licensed prophalytic inhibitory measure to rsv infection considerable energy has been devoted to evaluating the antigenic sites of the rsv fusion f protein and optimizing f expression constructs for higher immunogenicity 105 current structural vaccinology efforts to evaluate the pre-fusion and post-fusion antigenic forms of rsv f protein have led to the induction and identification of potent neutralizing antibodies with higher neutralizing potencies than palivizumab 136137 the availability of new structures and sequences has made predictive structural modeling and structure-based antigen design viable options for renewed efforts at design of vaccines for which no current vaccines existadvances in biotechnology have shaped the field of virology as much as any other field of science the capacity to engineer reverse genetics platforms for the study and manipulation of rna virus genomes has revolutionized the field of vaccine design we have described here rna virus reverse genetic systems and past and current efforts to develop vaccines to provide immunity to several human rna virus pathogens the incorporation of new advances in reverse genetics technology adjuvants non-human models of infection and surveillance will continue to drive the development of next generation vaccines to pathogens for which we already have vaccination strategies as well as those that we currently do not ongoing changes in human demographics and accessibility to health care are likely to modify cost-benefit analyses and provoke allocation of new resources for scientific study and development of vaccines despite the ongoing evolution of vaccine design and implementation the hallmarks of an effective viral vaccine will remain the same high efficacy safety and stabilitysevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is a highly contagious and severe atypical pneumonia which is caused by a new coronavirus and is predominantly transmitted by droplets and contact with contaminated fomites tsang ho ooi et al 2003 rota et al 2003 seto et al 2003 riley et al 2003 sars has rapidly spread worldwide and there were in total 8098 reported cases with 774 fatalities at july 31st 2003 world health organization 2003a an ongoing controversial topic is the estimation of the fatality rate of sars the usual definition of the fatality rate that has been adopted by the world health organization who is the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of infected people in the course of the epidemic world health organization 2003b this is often called the case fatality rate and is assumed to be a constantwhile the outbreak was on going and there were patients still in hospitals over the course of the epidemic the who estimate assumed implicitly that all remaining sars inpatients would eventually recover it therefore led to an underestimation of the true case fatality rate for example in the midst of the sars outbreak at april 15th 2003 the fatality rate in hong kong was 45 according to the who estimate but it hit a record high of 170 at the end of the epidemic furthermore the who estimate cannot reflect the changing fatality rate over the course of the epidemic in a timely manner owing to the use of cumulative data in the calculation the who estimates of the fatality rates of hong kong singapore taiwan beijing and toronto were 170 139 107 65 and 158 at july 31st 2003 respectively hong kong appeared to have the highest fatality rate
donnelly et al 2003 were the first to apply a survival analysis framework to analyse the sars data and to estimate the time delay distributions of the times since infection to onset onset to admission admission to death and admission to discharge they assumed a fixed probability  the case fatality rate and 1 for the respective outcomes of death and recovery for each inpatient on admission during the whole course of the epidemic their approach projected an estimate of the case fatality rate and the estimate depends on whether the age of the patient is over 60 years or not their formulation can also be easily extended to a mixture of regression or threshold models to incorporate exogenous variables in this setting the constant case fatality rate is often interpreted as a measure of the severity or virulence of an infectious diseasefor a completely new disease like sars it would be worthwhile and informative to inves tigate how the rate of death given that a patient either dies or recovers varies with time as clinical experience on diagnosis and management improve over time when modelling this rate there is no need to model the infectious process as our interest is in measuring the fatality that is inflicted by the epidemic also the duration of hospitalization of individual patients is not taken into account since the initiation of hospitalization of an sars patient is dependent on several factors including the very early screening of hospital staff who are exposed leading to detection and hospitalization of very early and asymptomatic disease which is in contrast with the reluctance of some cases to seek medical attention thereby delaying their hospitalization in the process in this paper we call this rate the realtime fatality rate the rapid accumula tion of experience and knowledge on the diagnosis investigation and management along with different age groups being affected at different times compounded by differences in viral loads and other confounding factors do not permit the assumption of a constant rate throughout the period of the outbreak  to monitor the fatality of an emerging epidemic an estimator for such a timespecific rate at the population level should be used to assess the efficacy of treatment in realtime especially when the disease is rapidly evolving for instance there is also considerable controversy on the treatment of sars wenzel and edmond 2003 the efficacy of ribavirin and corticosteroids which were commonly used in hong kong for an empirical treatment of sars is not proven by controlled trial studies that were impossible to organize during the initial outbreak in the absence of large scale clinical trials to assess the efficacy of various treatments investigators are interested in the estimation of the realtime fatality rate over the course of the epidemic with a broad assessment of the effect of other factors including variation in clinical management and other exogenous including unidentified or unspecified factors over the course of the outbreakin this paper a counting process in a competing risk setup is used to model the transitions from inpatient to death and from inpatient to recovery andersen et al 1993 yip and lam 1992 1993 the inpatients are subject to death or recovery or to remain in the hospital over the course of the epidemic here the timescale of interest is the calendar time rather than the usual time to event from admission in standard survival analysis studies as in donnelly et al 2003 a new measure termed the realtime fatality rate is proposed in this paper and is defined as the probability of death conditioned on a transition to death or recovery at time t this formulation can therefore model the fatality rate in realtime for the infected community in a macro perspective since rate estimates from survival models are usually estimated as step functions a kernel method is used to smooth the estimates of the transition rates for recovery and death at time t and for the realtime fatality rate this realtime fatality rate is also useful in providing information on the efficacy of certain treatments and on the management of the disease during the outbreak of the disease the approximate pointwise confidence limits of the respective transition and the realtime fatality rates are readily available the method is applied to the sars data from the regions affected namely hong kong singapore toronto taiwan and beijingthe daily data on admission discharge and death for all sars patients in hong kong singapore taiwan beijing and toronto were obtained from the web sites of the respective government agencies and authorities hong kong httpwwwinfogovhkinfosarscnewshtm singapore httpappmohgovsgsarsnewsupdatesasp taiwan httpsarsdohgovtwnews beijing httpwwwmohgovcnzhglyqfbindexhtm toronto httpwwwhc-scgccapphb-dgspspsars-sraseu-aeindexhtml all patients with probable sars were diagnosed according to the criteria that were established by the who world health organization 2003b briefly patients with probable sars presented with high fever temperature above 38c coughing or breathing difficulty contact history with sars patients and pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia on chest radiographs or high resolution computed tomography of the thorax that could not be explained by an alternative diagnosis tsang mok wong and ooi 2003 the criteria from the who and centers for disease control and prevention 2003 do not require microbiological confirmation although most patients with sars in hong kong have positive serological evidence of sars coronavirus infection ie a significant rise in immunoglobulin g after a period of 21 days peiris et al 2003for each inpatient the final outcome must be either death or recovery the primary target of most medical treatments and policies for lethal epidemics such as sars is to lower the fatality rate during the outbreak of the epidemic ie to lower the force of death relative to recovery rather than necessarily to shorten the period of hospitalization hence a measure of treatment efficacy should be time sensitive calendar time but not chronological time and focus on their effects on death and recovery by considering these two outcomes as competing risks as in yip and lam 1992 we can obtain a realtime fatality rate which serves well for treatment or policy evaluation during the epidemic the two risks which are not necessarily independent are assumed to operate simultaneously on the inpatients since the times of the outbreak in sarsaffected areas are different we have different time origins different calendar times for different regions depending on the time of onset of the sars epidemic and the availability of the data with all areas followed longitudinally up to june 30th 2003 the method proposed makes use of the information only on the cumulative number of deaths cumulative number of discharges and sars patients who are still in hospital on day t for the hong kong region t0 for march 1st 2003 t1 for march 2nd 2003 and so on denoted by n

details on the estimation of 
1t and 
2t can be found in yip and lam 1992 1993 since the time unit is days there were situations where several people recovered or died on the same day for simplicity we assume that all the deaths occurred before the discharges on each day this assumption has very little effect on the estimates it should be noted that only those exit times t

by the martingale theories it can be shown that the estimates of the cumulative intensities  for i12 are nearly orthogonal and hence the covariance is 0 the delta method can be used to estimate the variance of

finally we propose a new measure of the fatality rate t defined as the probability of death conditioned on a transition to death or recovery at time t mathematically

a natural estimator for t is thus

approximate 1001 confidence limits for t can also be obtained in a similar manner to that for t also it is important to note that as mentioned earlier there is no need to model the complex hospitalization process iu in our formulation as far as the estimation of the realtime fatality rate is concernedfor the entire hong kong region up to july 31st 2003 altogether 1755 cases were hospitalized of these 1456 and 299 cases were discharged and died from sars respectively figs 1a and 1b depict the estimates of 
1t and 
2t respectively together with the associated 95 confidence bands both transition rates increased with time since the beginning of the epidemic the estimated intensity of transition to death
 peaked around march 20th decreased and then increased again around may 15th 2003 the estimated intensity of recovery
 peaked around april 1st where most of the sars patients who were medical health workers from a regional hospital prince of wales hospital were discharged and another two peaks were also found around the end of april and on may 19th fig 1c depicts the ratio estimate of the two rates
 while fig 1d shows the plot of the estimated realtime fatality rate at time t
 over the course of the epidemic together with the who estimate the who methodology estimated the case fatality rates of sars in hong kong at march 30th april 15th and may 25th 2003 as 25 99 and 158 respectively and started to stabilize thereafter with a final estimate of 17 at june 30th in contrast the realtime fatality rate was chaotically high at the beginning of the outbreak since few patients were discharged in the early stages of the outbreak the realtime fatality rate seemed to have stabilized from early april fluctuating between 15 and 20 similar figures for the estimated realtime fatality rates with different origins for singapore taiwan beijing and toronto are given in fig 2
the number of sars cases in singapore was smaller than that of hong kong probably because of the confinement of outbreaks within hospitals and the lack of major community outbreaks such as that occurring in amoy gardens in hong kong there were altogether 238 cases with 33 deaths with a whoestimated case fatality rate of 139 fig 2a shows that the realtime fatality rate appeared to stabilize approximately 4 weeks after the outbreak which was similar to what happened in hong kong the fatality rates fluctuated between 15 and 19 after the middle of aprildata from taiwan became available from april 4th 2003 altogether 37 deaths were found out of the 346 cases with a who case fatality rate of 107 however the timevarying rate suggested an unusually high rate in the early part of the outbreak which subsequently improved most of the major outbreaks were found within hospitals in taiwanfor toronto the data were available from march 18th 2003 with a total of 39 deaths from 247 infected cases giving a who case fatality rate of 158 sars had made a comeback in the community httpwwwhc-scgccapphb-dgspspsars-sraseu-aeindexhtml the most recent date of onset of illness and isolation among probable cases was june 12th most of the sars cases in canada were found in torontofor beijing a special hospital was built within two weeks to treat the sars patients in may 2003 the government implemented very effective measures to prevent infection in the community and in hospital including the removal of the minister of health and the mayor of beijing city who failed to deal with the epidemic control a very high level working group was set up and headed by a vicepremier the realtime fatality rate was estimated to be high in the early stage of the epidemic and continuously improved over the course of the epidemic such that the rate was less than 5 by june 10th however the who case fatality rate was much higher than this june estimate of the timevarying rate since the former was very much affected by the early dataan estimation of the fatality rate in the situation of an emerging outbreak or epidemic is never straightforward this is particularly true for sars when clinicians all over the world had to deal with this highly contagious and frightening pneumonic illness with no idea of its aetiology pathogenesis clinical features management issues or prognosis other than anecdotal information from colleagues from mainland china tsang and lam 2003 lee et al 2003 the original estimate of the fatality rate for sars was only about 45 by both the who and the hong kong health authority department of health of hong kong government 2003 even as late as the beginning of april 2003 this was later adjusted to about 10 in may 2003 this underestimation of the fatality rate from sars must have undoubtedly affected the health care planning measures that were taken to contain sars and thus the outcome of the sars outbreak at the community levelour comparison of the estimated realtime fatality rates among the sarsaffected areas shows that the sars fatality rate appears to be changing with time in all regions besides beijing the realtime fatality rates of all other areas seem to fluctuate around 1220 the constant fatality assumption which was adopted by donnelly et al 2003 does not reflect the situation at the population level indeed the approach of donnelly et al 2003 can be extended easily to regression models set up to allow for differences in the diagnosis and management of patients by allowing the time constant case fatality rate to depend on relevant possibly timevarying explanatory variables however a timevarying fatality rate at a population level is always helpful and meaningful to medical researchersin addition this changing fatality pattern is not reflected by the definition of case fatality rate that has been adopted by the who that derives from the ratio of cumulative deaths to the total number of cases diagnosed any variation in clinical outcome measures eg as a result of improved treatment modalities would not be depicted by such a definition by using the actual calendar timescale rather than duration of hospitalization the method proposed provides a visual assessment of the effect of other factors including variation in clinical management and other exogenous including unidentified factors over the course of the outbreak a stable estimate of the fatality rate could reflect a more mature approach to the diagnosis and treatment of sars although the efficacy of using high dose corticosteroid and ribavirin to deal with the lung parenchymal inflammation and coronavirus itself are largely controversial booth et al 2003 wenzel and edmond 2003 cyranoski 2003 the constant case fatality assumption is more suitable for some wellknown infectious diseases such as rabies or smallpox because the aetiology pathogenesis and treatment have been well studied with a standard treatment protocol it is recommended that the realtime fatality rate be investigated at the outbreak of an emerging epidemic it can serve as an indicator of the change in the fatality rate over time and can provide information on the effectiveness of the policy and treatment that are adoptedour data show that sars fatality rates among hong kong singapore and toronto were similar whereas beijing appeared to have a lower rate after the first month of the epidemic in the absence of data from controlled clinical trials for the treatment of sars it would be interesting to speculate whether the timevarying fatality rates that are calculated by our model could be related to the different clinical treatment protocols that were used by these areas for instance the use of ribavirin was essentially forbidden in canada by late april 2003 whereas it has consistently been the standard empirical practice in hong kong the use of continuous positive airway pressure delivered by nasal masks to patients with hypoxia has been partly attributed as a cause of the low case fatality and low intensive care unit admission in mainland china personal communication from professor n s zhong of guangdong the use of traditional chinese medicine has also been claimed to be the cause of low case fatalities in beijing and glycyrrhizin an active component of liquorice roots has been shown to inhibit the replication of sarsassociated coronavirus cinatl et al 2003 the singaporian practice of using ribavirin and corticosteroid in the treatment of sars is not uniform and the standard protocol that is practised in taiwan has not been fully published twu et al 2003 hsu et al 2003 although these differences in clinical practices could contribute to a difference in case fatalities it should be cautioned that they do not necessarily equate to conclusions that are drawn from controlled clinical trials not withstanding these limitations especially acknowledging the insensitivity of the case fatality rate as a clinical outcome and the possible discrepancy in the diagnostic stringency it is possible that ribivarin treatment could have no effects in the clinical outcome of sars patientsthere is increasing concern about emerging infections all over the world and sars is only an example of how ignorant we are in dealing with the statisticalepidemiological and clinical management of this condition our model of using the realtime fatality rate should allow epidemiologists to monitor not only sars but also other emerging infections and conditions in the futurecorrigendum for this article in journal

the coronavirus and the resulting lockdowns and economic restrictions are severely testing the structural resilience of european economies on the domestic level the imposed restrictions tend to hit economically weaker households and firms harder causing large-scale economic hardship that might fuel public resistance against economic restrictions based on public health concerns hence social divisions may undermine the resilience of european societies in terms of public health on the level of domestic economies likewise preliminary evidence on the european level suggests that economically weaker nations within the eurozone are hit harder by the corona crisis which may have severe repercussions for the eurozone as a whole while this article focuses on the latter aspectby asking how the corona crisis may contribute to the amplification of economic polarisation within the eurozonea common observation worth spelling out in both the domestic as well as in the european context is that existing social divisions limit the collective resilience of societies in public health terms in both contexts weaker actors are not only hit harder but have also fewer resources and leeway to cope with the immediate consequences of the crisisfor the case of the eurozone the present article points out that because of the polarisation processes that started well before the corona pandemic both the extent of existing vulnerabilities as well as the policy space to counter the crisis differ considerably across eurozone member countries as a consequence the economic impacts are likely to be asymmetric and will in the absence of coordinated policy responses accelerate existing polarisation processes between an economically more well-off northern and a struggling southern eurozone1the enormous challenge of economic recovery after the corona health crisis will be most pressing in the southern parts of the eurozone which consists of greece italy portugal and spain in these southern countries the crisis is forecast to reduce gdp growth rates more than in the northern eurozone countries comprising austria belgium finland germany and the netherlands see panel a of fig 1 since france often takes an intermediate position it is reported separately furthermore unemployment rates in southern countries have not only reached much higher levels in pre-corona times as compared to the northern eurozone they also seem to be more strongly affected by the advent of the corona crisis according to the most recent macroeconomic forecasts2 southern countries will suffer a relatively more pronounced increase in unemployment due to the economic downturn aggravating the already existing differences in the eurozone see panel b of fig 1 thus recovery needs differ considerable across regions in northern and southern parts of the eurozone european commission 2020aat the same time southern eurozone countriesabove all italy and greecehave entered into the corona crisis with high levels of public debt recent forecasts suggest that increases in fiscal deficits in the southern periphery will be particularly severe due to increasing government spending and decreasing tax revenues and public-debt-to-gdp ratioswhich are quantitatively affected by both increasing fiscal deficits as well as decreasing gdpwill rise strongly see panels c and d of fig 1 furthermore government revenues are expected to decline more in southern eurozone countries against the background of bigger losses in economic activity than in northern eurozone countries at the same time government spending is forecast to increase more in the northern eurozone countries reflecting a stronger response by automatic stabilizers as well as bigger discretionary efforts to counteract the corona crisis see fig 2against this background there is a risk thatunder current institutional conditionsitaly and other southern eurozone countries will be able to finance only the most urgent measures while northern eurozone countries with a better starting positionespecially germany austria or the netherlandshave more fiscal space to support a rapid recovery once the economy is jump-started in this view the main constraints that prohibit a quicker recovery of southern countries arise from the current institutional arrangements under which fiscal space is typically correlated with macroeconomic performance heimberger and kapeller 20173 available data already point to such asymmetric fiscal responses at the national level in particular the immediate increase in fiscal spending in germany in the form of additional government spending on medical equipment short-time work subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises etc amounts to more than 10 of economic output in 2020 compared with only 09 for italy 11 in spain 25 in portugal and 11 in greece but also the indirect fiscal responsethe deferral of taxes and social security contributions as well as other liquidity provisions and loan guaranteeslags behind germany in all southern countries except italy see fig 3 based on anderson et al 2020 while the numbers shown in fig 3 are influenced by a series of qualitatively different factorsincluding the impact of the pandemic and the state of the public health systemsthey also reflect differences in fiscal space across countries especially in the context of direct spending undertaken by governments this observation suggests that existing differentials in economic performance are indeed aggravated through the corona pandemic and that the competitiveness as well as the standard of living in the southern countries is likely to deteriorate further relative to other parts of the eurozonethis article discusses these uneven macroeconomic consequences and economic policy responses against the background of an analysis of longer-term macroeconomic divergence in the eurozone previous research has shown that the underlying processes are path-dependent and relate not only to the divergence of major macroeconomic indicators but also to the polarisation of production structures between eurozone member countries and the associated development of divergent export-led and private-debt-led growth models simonazzi 2013 botta 2014 storm and naastepad 2015 celi et al 2018 grbner et al 2020b the present paper also highlights that increased macroeconomic polarisation in pre-corona years has fuelled political polarisation which has become visible in recent corona policy debates concerning the appropriate response to the macroeconomic consequences of the covid-19 pandemic countries such as italy and spain have immediately pushed for a stronger common european fiscal response only to find their more ambitious proposals about european burden-sharing of the crisis costs turned down by northern eurozone countries a more nuanced discussion about the potential for a pan-european recovery initiative only started with a considerably time lag promoted by a change in the political stance of the german government it will be argued below however thatin the absence of coordinated policy interventionsthe process of economic divergence occurring in the eurozone must be expected to accelerate further after the lockdown such a process would put the eurozone as a whole at risk with an eye to preventing the common currency area from falling part we will discuss some elements of coordinated fiscal and industrial policy action that could contribute to countering economic polarisation in the context of the corona crisis such policies could also be designed in a way that is consistent with a longer-term orientation towards achieving social and environmental sustainabilitythe gap in per capita incomes between northern and southern eurozone countries has widened considerably since the birth of the euro about twenty years ago see fig 4a particularly the 10 years before the corona crisis have been characterised by a persistent divergence in terms of living standards of large parts of the eurozone which can be traced back to the co-existence of distinct growth models within the emu southern european countries mainly followed debt-led growth models which came with increasing private-sector indebtedness linked to the accumulation of current account deficits eg storm and naastepad 2016 at the same time northern countries mainly followed export-led growth models which came with current account surpluses and a stronger reliance on foreign trade when the financial crisis and the subsequent euro crisis hit the fragility of these imbalances built up in pre-crisis times laid bare the underlying reality of macroeconomic divergence grbner et al 2020bessential factors for explaining the long-term divergence of eurozone countries are to be found in the unequal regulatory conditions in the context of the european race for the best location for example in the areas of the labour market tax and corporate law or financial market regulation see kapeller et al 2019 as well as in the different technological capabilities across eu countries grbner et al 2019 2020b technological capabilities serve as an important driver of long-term economic development and there exists a strong positive relationship between the level of economic complexity used as a proxy for technological capabilities see hidalgo and hausmann 2009 and gdp per capita levels see fig 4b the problem in the decades running up to the corona crisis has been that the accumulation of these technological capabilities is a highly path-dependent process in the absence of coordinated policy measures existing differentials in technological capabilities will be self-reinforcing over time particularly within the eurozone where traditional compensation mechanisms for individual member countries are either not available currency devaluations or severely restricted fiscal and monetary policy due to existing institutional arrangementstechnological capabilities are also relevant when it comes to explaining the emergence of the unsustainable co-existence of export-driven and debt-driven growth models in the emu countries in the north were better equipped to follow an export-led growth model precisely because their economies have accumulated a sufficient amount of the technological capabilities necessary to compete successfully on international markets where technological sophistication is more important than price competitiveness storm and naastepad 2015 dosi et al 2015 grbner et al 2020b furthermore northern euro countriesmost of all germanywere able to strive over recent decades not despite but also because of the rise of asian economies such as china for firms that have focused on the production of technologically complex products the rise of asian countries came with additional export opportunities to asian partners who were keen to acquire more complex products and capital goods technological sophistication of firms in northern eurozone countries represented a unique competitive advantage in the global economy that remains relevant until todaythe emergence of these different growth models also had a feedback effect on the further development of production structures while germany and other northern countries have expanded their cumulative advantage in high-tech manufacturing over the past 2 decades southern european countries have increasingly been locked into lower-tech and non-tradable activities eg simonazzi 2013 botta 2014 as a consequence northern firms often do not directly compete with spanish portuguese greek or even most italian firms instead they are price-setters due to their strong market standing which is generated by a high degree of technological sophistication in contrast firms located on the southern periphery eg greece and portugal are more often confined to the role of price-takers as they compete with low-cost asian producers straca 2013 as a consequence they were much less able to base their competitiveness on technological capabilities while competing in terms of low wages or reduced environmental or labour protections would also be economically infeasible and politically destructive given the current levels of wages and regulations in europein summary most european firms with a strong technological position typically operate from their home base in northern countries such as germany and austria despite important exceptions particularly in the industrial north of italy and spain many firms in the southern eurozone are relative technological laggards and the overall international competitiveness of southern economies has deteriorated due to the cumulative nature of the underlying processes existing differences in technological capabilities are to be seen as both a driving factor as well as a major outcome of long-term divergence within the eurozone grbner et al 2020b which is reflected in increasing macroeconomic polarisation as captured by fig 4the macroeconomic impact of the corona crisis on northern and southern eurozone countries will be asymmetric due to existing differences in production structures and because of the vulnerabilities of the different growth models described above the most recent macroeconomic forecasts suggest that domestic demand will take a bigger hit in the southern eurozone than in northern eurozone countries see fig 5 given their relatively strong reliance on domestic demand as compared to exports this implies a particular challenge for these economies however germany and other northern eurozone countries will also not be able to rely on export-driven growth to the same extent as in the years 20102019 because china and other emerging asian economies also suffer greater economic losses which decreases their demand for imports moreover the global economy as a whole has been hit hard by the repercussions of the coronavirus international monetary fund 2020 and the partial disruption of global value chains will make an export-based recovery strategy more difficult to implement in the medium term as well however the data in fig 5 suggest that the overall challenge is considerably more difficult for countries in the south as domestic demand takes a bigger hit and exports decline more stronglyfigure 6 provides a breakdown of declining exports in terms of exports of goods and exports of services respectively thereby it points to yet another way in which structural polarisation patterns from the pre-corona years provide the conditions for an asymmetric effect of the corona shock while exports of goods are set to decline to a similar extent in northern and southern countries the much stronger drop in exports of services in the south exposes another vulnerability the prospects for booming global markets for export goods have deteriorated but the prospects for exports of servicesin particular concerning the tourism-related sectorsmay be even gloomier because of shifting preferences for tourist destinations and the restrictions imposed on international travel prolonged restrictions will have disproportionately strong negative effects on the regions in southern europe which clearly raises the prospect of accelerating macroeconomic divergence odendahl and springford 20204 moreover while at least some of the goods that have been produced for export but have not been sold yet can be put in storage and still represent an increase in value-added in the future services that have not been demanded in the present tend to be lost forever this suggests that the recovery process for southern countries will be more difficult than in northern countriesthe analysis above suggests thatin the absence of adequate coordinated european policy interventionsthe corona crisis will contribute to a further deepening of macroeconomic divergence and structural polarisation between northern and southern eurozone countries as economic polarisation fuels political polarisation this process puts the survival of the eurozone as a whole at risk in what follows we briefly evaluate european economic policy initiatives in response to the corona shock in this context we do not only inspect short-run issues but also explore whether and to what extent current policy measures are suitable for addressing the root causes of economic polarisation within the eurozone by drawing on a holistic analysis of policy-challenges induced or aggravated by this polarisationas developed by kapeller et al 2019 and summarized in table 1 belowthe first immediate european policy responses to the coronavirus came from the ecb which started to buy up government bonds on a large scale the pepp programme pandemic emergency purchase programme was put in place to prevent rising interest rate spreads and to ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the economy lane 2020 it serves to ensure that governments in the southern eurozone can continue to refinance at low interest rates during the corona crisis however as indicated by our analysis above southern eurozone countries such as italy and spain will not be able to get the economy back on track after the corona lockdown with the simple provision of cheap credit the eus fiscal rules have been temporarily suspended but southern countries are still suffering from legacy debt and problems related to structural polarisation which will become even more apparent when the fiscal rules suspension is lifted to further reduce their fiscal space in sum the ecb is as in past crises again acting as a lender of last resort to hold the eurozone together however existing institutional arrangements still pose constraints on the actions of the ecb therefore the corona crisis opens up a window for discussing a modified mandate for the ecb which widens it from a primary focus on price stability to also include a commitment to maximum employment and environmental sustainability however such discussions currently remain subordinated to the question about the short to medium run effects of the german constitutional courts recent ruling that the ecb has failed to adequately justify its quantitative easing program tooze 2020in addition to the ecbs actions european leaders have decided on a package of loan assistance amounting to 540 billion euros a new esm credit line has been established up to 240 billion euros whichalthough only subject to minor conditionalitywill be limited to covering direct and indirect health costs however government spending on healthcare costs will not play a major role in the bigger picture of the costs of the crisis furthermore it is doubtful whether a country like italy would ever use such a credit line because the esm is seen to be politically toxic due to memories going back to the euro crisis in addition there is a new eu programme to grant member states cheap loans without conditions to support short-time work which is called sure support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency this will enable the eu to borrow on financial markets and to pass on the funds to the member states furthermore the package consists of loan guarantees from the european investment bank for companieseven if european loans came with cheap conditions and light or no conditionality where especially the point concerning light conditionality remains doubtful they will nevertheless further increase public debt levels in southern euro countries hit hard by the pandemic much of the discussion concerning longer-term questions of european burden sharing has therefore revolved around the establishment of a so-called recovery fund and the possibility of grants however even if we assume that a sizeable recovery fund including a component of grants for the regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic is implemented over the horizon of the next couple of years such a short-run policy instrument would still prove insufficient if the goal is to reverse the underlying path-dependent process of polarisation between north and south without addressing the deeper problems of structural polarisation analysed in this paper any policy response to the corona crisis will suffer from limited impact in the long run to this end table 1 lists the policy suggestions for addressing polarisation as discussed in kapeller et al 2019 and compares them with actual corona-related policy measures and discussionscomparing the policy measures currently undertaken or planned with the long-term challenges arising from economic polarisation in the eurozone reveals that the current policy focus is mostly on short-run measures to keep the economy going andor to jumpstart economic activities after lockdowns and other restrictions have been sufficiently released more medium- or long-term considerations currently play a subordinate role although crises like the current one always carry the potential to induce greater reflexion among policy-makers and social elites of all kind what seems most urgent given the current focus on organizing the means for significant public investment in economic recovery is to tie these funds to important medium-term concerns such as the reorganisation of global value chains the expansion of industrial policies to combat technological divergence on the regional and national level or probably most importantly recasting european economies in a way that is compatible with planetary boundaries in the context of climate change and indeed such links between pressing immediate demands and medium-term strategic challenges also partially coin the viewpoint of the european commission eg european commission 2020b which has tried to connect the corona-response with its longer-term vision of a european green deal however these connections remain relatively unspecific and underdeveloped as they do neither indicate specific strategies for reaping the alleged synergies nor have they led to a commitment towards increased funding of the european green deal such a commitment however seems highly necessary given that the current funding lags behind the investment requirements for achieving relevant goals concerning the reduction of co2 emissions wildauer et al 2020 however if such links between the corona-response and the european green deal could be established and further developed the hopefully occurring recovery from the corona-crisis could have positive spill-over effects that would be of great merit for confronting the socio-economic challenges around the corona-corneras of 27 march 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been responsible for 530000 infection cases with 23552 deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly1 a total of 197 counties have been involved in this emerging infectious disease on march 11 2020 dr tedros the world health organization director-general said that covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic for the alarming levels of spread severity and inactionin china diagnostic test by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay is the main means of confirmation and throat swab samples are collected for convenience and noninvasiveness2 however this technique has a certain rate of false-negative results which might render convalescent covid-19 patients to meet the current criteria of current discharge or discontinuation of quarantine resulting in spread of virus3 in clinical settings at least two repeat rt-pcr assays are performed to reduce the false-negative rate a recent study reported that four medical professionals aged from 30 to 36 years still had positive rt-pcr results 5-13 days after recovery4 which caused widespread concern however this phenomenon was not explained by authors we could not determine whether it was disease relapse or not in this study we followed up seven patients who had positive rt-pcr results after recovery from covid-19 pneumonia and tried to find the possible explanationthis study was approved by the institutional review boards of the first affiliated hospital of jinan university and dongguan ninth peoples hospital and informed consent was waived the seven hospitalized covid-19 patients were treated at dongguan ninth peoples hospital from january 30 to february 5 2020 laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection was performed by rt-pcr assays of throat or rectal swabs according to the standard protocol5 sars-cov-2 infection was defined by at least two positive rt-pcr test results epidemiological characteristics demographic information laboratory findings and radiological features were collected from electronic medical records the criteria for discharge were according to the seventh trial version of the covid-19 pneumonia guidelines released by china6 1 normal temperature lasting longer than three days 2 significantly relieved respiratory symptoms 3 substantially improved acute exudative lesions on chest computed tomography and 4 a series of two repetitive negative rt-pcr test results with at least one day interval after hospital discharge all the patients were quarantined in designated hospitals and followed up by rt-pcr testsamong the seven patients four had a recent travel to wuhan one had visited their relatives in wuhan and one had contacted family member who had been to wuhan three children patient 1-3 had at least one infected family member the seven patients included one female infant 10 months two male adolescents 13 and 14 year-old and four young adult males 26 33 35 and 35 year-old all the patients had no underlying diseases except for the

showed laboratory tests of the seven patients only patient 4 6 had lymphopenia six patients had normal chest ct on admission except for the infant had bilateral pneumonia all the seven patients had positive rt-pcr test results of throat swabs the severity of covid-19 was mild in six patients and moderate in only one patientthe infant patient received oseltamivir 15 mg twice daily the four adult patients received arbidol 200mg three times daily orally lopinavir and ritonavir 400 mg twice daily and interferon alpha 1b 50 g twice daily one adolescent received oseltamivir 15 mg twice daily arbidol 100 mg three times daily and lopinavir and ritonavir 400 mg every 12 hours and the other adolescent received arbidol 100 mg three times daily and lopinavir and ritonavir 400 mg every 12 hours six patients were supplemented with oxygen via nasal cannula after treatment three patients respiratory symptoms were significantly relieved the infants pneumonia was obviously absorbed while the chest ct images of remaining patients were unchanged six patients had at least two consecutive negative rt-pcr results of throat swabs and one adult had two consecutive negative rt-pcr results of both throat and rectal swabs the time from admission to recovery ranged from 11 to 23 daysafter hospital discharge the patients were asked to continue the quarantine in designated hospitals for 14 days during the quarantine four patients had positive rt-pcr assays of rectal swabs only two had positive rt-pcr results of throat swabs and one had positive rt-pcr results of both throat and rectal swabs fig 1
 the time from hospital discharge to positive rt-pcr results after recovery was 711 days the patients were asymptomatic and chest ct images showed no change from the last scan before discharge they did not report contact with any suspected or confirmed person all the patients were admitted to hospital again because positive rectal swabs in six patients or positive throat swabs in one patient they were treated with chinese medicine toujiequwenkeli 11g twice daily orally the median length of second hospital stay was 10 days interquartile 6-10 days several days before the second discharge most patients had at least two repetitive negative rt-pcr tests of both throat and rectal swabs but the patients 3 6 and 7 continued the quarantine in designated hospitals because of negative throat swabs but positive rectal swabs after 2 14 and 2 days respectively rectal swabs of the three patients turned negative the time from initial positive to negative rectal swabs ranged from 5 to 23 days given that the first discharge criteria of patients were based on throat swabs instead of rectal swabs the longest rectal virus shedding might be more than 23 daysin this case series we reported seven young patients who met the current criteria for discharge in china but still had positive rt-pcr test results 7-11 days after discharge these findings suggested that some recovered patients may still be virus carriers which questioned the current discharge criteria that two repetitive negative rt-pcr tests with a one-day gap between the two tests of throat swabs are necessary in this study most patients had two consecutive negative rt-pcr test results of throat swabs before discharge but positive rt-pcr test results of rectal swabs after discharge indicating the necessity of adding rt-pcr testing of rectal swab specimens to the criteria for discharge or discontinuation of quarantine the current discharge criteria can be more stringent if current testing load and medical resource allowed previous findings showed rectal swab-testing might be more useful than throat swab-testing in determining the effect of treatment and the timing of termination of quarantine7 a recent study showed persistent rectal swab positives even after nasopharyngeal swab testing turned negative in eight children8 it was speculated that different sampling tissues may have different levels of viral nucleic acid and lasting time of virus shedding the detection rate of specimens is limited by the level of viral nucleic acid viral shedding from the digestive system might be more severe and lasting longer than that from the respiratory tract more rectal swab positives were found in a later stage of infection as compared with oral swab positives suggesting viral shedding and transmitting through oral-fecal route9 in addition intermittent virus shedding might occur in recovered patients one patient had both negative throat and rectal swabs before hospital discharge but had positive throat swab during quarantine therefore positive rt-pcr results occurred in most patients recovered from covid-19 might not be caused by virus recurrence or second virus infection all the patients continued to be asymptomatic and chest ct showed no changes from previous images might also support this viewpointalthough positive rt-pcr test results were found for convalescent patients antiviral therapy might not be needed because most patients rt-pcr results would turn negative in several days antibodies igm and igg against sars-cov-2 infection may be produced in these patients therefore the transmission risk is low even if the patients have positive rt-pcr test results after recovery antibody igg can persist a very long time10 although there is no firm evidence indicating these patients would transmit the virus to others we should be aware the potential way of transmission through the oral-faecal route11

12 patients should continue the quarantine in designated hospitals for at least 14 days and be followed up by rt-pcr assays of both throat and rectal swabs to avoid false-negative in addition psychological intervention is necessary for patients recovered from covid-19 but have positive rt-pcr results again because they may experience psychological problems including anxiety depression sleeplessness and stress the study was limited to a small number of patients with mild or moderate sars-cov-2 infection patients with severe or critically ill diseases should be included for further study large cohort study may be needed to confirm these findingsthe authors declare no competing interestscoronaviruses covs are a family of viruses pathogenic for humans and animals associated to respiratory and gastro-intestinal infections covs used to be considered as minor human pathogens as they were responsible of common cold or mild respiratory infections in immunocompetent people channappanavar and perlman 2017 nonetheless the emergence of novel and highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases caused by covs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and most recently sars-cov-2 brings to light questions to be addressed to guide public health responsecovs are mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets meselson 2020 however as for sars and mers sars-cov-2 rna has been detected in stool samples from patients exhibiting symptoms of covid-19 and from asymptomatic carriers he et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wlfel et al 2020 young et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the duration of viral shedding has been observed to vary among patients with means of 1421 days y wu et al 2020b xu et al 2020 as well as the magnitude of shedding varies from 102 up to 108 rna copies per gram lescure et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wlfel et al 2020infectious viruses deriving from fecal and urine specimen have reportedly been cultured in vero e6 cells sun et al 2020 w wang et al 2020b in addition gastric duodenal and rectal epithelial cells are infected by sars-cov-2 and the release of the infectious virions to the gastrointestinal tract supports the possible fecal-oral transmission route xiao et al 2020 even though the possibility of faecal-oral transmission has been hypothesized the role of secretions in the spreading of the disease is not clarified yet w wang et al 2020b y wu et al 2020b xu et al 2020 yeo et al 2020wastewater monitoring has been a successful strategy pursued to track chemical and biological markers of human activity including illicit drugs consumption pharmaceuticals useabuse water pollution and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance genes choi et al 2018 de oliveira et al 2020 lorenzo and pic 2019 mercan et al 2019 viral diseases have been also surveilled by the detection of genetic material into wastewater as for enteric viruses hellmer et al 2014 prevost et al 2015 santiso-belln et al 2020 re-emerging zoonotic hepatitis e virus cuevas-ferrando et al 2020 miura et al 2016 and poliovirus during the global eradication programme asghar et al 2014currently various studies detected sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater worldwide ahmed et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 rimoldi et al 2020 f wu et al 2020a wurtzer et al 2020 and wastewater testing has been suggested as a non-invasive early-warning tool for monitoring the status and trend of covid-19 infection and as an instrument for tuning public health response daughton 2020 mallapaty 2020 naddeo and liu 2020 under current circumstance this environmental surveillance could be implemented in wastewater treatment plants as a tool designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdownhere we report the first detection of sars-cov-2 rna in untreated wastewater samples in spain collected from six different wastewater treatment plants wwtps in murcia the lowest prevalence area in iberian peninsula additionally the efficacy of the secondary and tertiary treatments implemented in the wwpts against sars-cov-2 has been confirmed the outcomes of the environmental surveillance reflect the epidemiological data in a low covid-19 diagnosed cases setting thus supporting the need of developing and implementing advanced models for wastewater-based epidemiology wbeinfluent secondary and tertiary treated effluent water samples were collected from six wwtps located in the main cities of the region of murcia spain fig 1

in general rt-qpcr amplification signals have been detected in wastewaters when cases were diagnosed within the municipality positive wastewater samples have been detected with at least two out of three rt-qpcr assays in low prevalence municipalities as in murcia 96 cases 2118 cases per 100000 inhabitants cartagena 36 cases 1676 and molina de segura 12 cases 1669 of note positive wastewater samples were detected 1216 days before covid-19 cases were declared in lorca cieza and totana municipalitiesa similar study conducted in paris france demonstrated the detection of viral genome before the exponential phase of the epidemic wurtzer et al 2020 however our results indicate that sars-cov-2 can be detected weeks before the first confirmed case the early detection of sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater could have alerted about the imminent danger giving a valuate time to the managers to coordinate and implement actions to slow the spread of the disease therefore our outcomes support that wbe could be used as an early warning tool to monitor the status of covid-19 infection within a communityon the other hand we believe that this environmental surveillance could be used as an instrument to drive the right decisions to reduce the risk of lifting restrictions too early for instance a key question is how to reduce the risk of a second wave andor recurring local outbreaks massive population tests are the first choice but in their absence wastewater monitorization of sars-cov-2 rna can give a reliable picture of the current situation our wastewater data do not quantitatively resemble the prevalence of covid-19 confirmed cases to this end a quantitative model that includes and corrects all the variables affecting these wastewater surveillance data would be useful for a better interpretation for instance not all covid-19 positive patients excrete sars-cov-2 rna in faeces and when it occurs the titers and the duration of shedding vary among individuals and across time he et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wlfel et al 2020 xu et al 2020 on the other hand the real number of positive cases within the murcia region remains unknown because of the large number of mild or asymptomatic carriers that have not been included in epidemiological statisticsthese aspects together with environmental variables eg rainfall events temperature hydraulic retention time in sewers increase the uncertainties linked to the correlation between sars-cov-2 rna detection in wastewater samples and the prevalence of covid-19 that could be explored by using complex modelsoverall wastewater surveillance and wbe may represent a complementary approach to estimate the presence and even the prevalence of covid-19 in communities this represents an effective tool that needs to be further explored in order to direct public health response especially in cases of limited capacity for clinical testingthe study was funded by the projects 20180705 of esamur 202070e101 of csic and viridiana agl2017-82909 aeifeder ue of miciu wr is supported by apostd2018150 postdoctoral fellowship of generalitat valenciana ec-f is recipient of a predoctoral contract from the micinn call 2018 pt is holder of the ryc2018- 025510-i ramn y cajal contract from the miciuthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
